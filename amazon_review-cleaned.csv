-1,"2 issues  -  Once I turned on the circle apps and installed this case,  my battery drained twice as fast as usual.  I ended up turning off the circle apps, which kind of makes the case just a case...  with a hole in it.  Second,  the wireless charging doesn't work.  I have a Motorola 360 watch and a Qi charging pad. The watch charges fine but this case doesn't. But hey, it looks nice."
1,"I’m embarrassed to admit that until recently, I have had a very negative opinion about “selfie sticks” aka “monopods” aka “narcissticks.” But having reviewed a number of them recently, they’re growing on me. This one is pretty nice and simple to set up and with easy instructions illustrated on the back of the box (not sure why some reviewers have stated that there are no instructions when they are clearly printed on the box unless they received different packaging than I did). Once assembled, the pairing via bluetooth and use of the stick are easy and intuitive. Nothing to it.<br /><br />The stick comes with a USB charging cable but arrived with a charge so you can use it immediately, though it’s probably a good idea to charge it right away so that you have no interruption of use out of the box. Make sure the stick is switched to on (it will light up) and extend your stick to the length you desire up to about a yard’s length and snap away.<br /><br />The phone clamp held the phone sturdily so I wasn’t worried about it slipping out. But the longer you extend the stick, the harder it is to maneuver.  But that will happen with any stick and is not specific to this one in particular.<br /><br />Two things that could improve this: 1) add the option to clamp this in portrait orientation instead of having to try and hold the stick at the portrait angle, which makes it feel unstable; 2) add the opening for a tripod so that this can be used to sit upright on a table for skyping and facetime eliminating the need to hold the phone up with your hand, causing fatigue.<br /><br />But other than that, this is a nice quality monopod for a variety of picture taking opportunities.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion."
1,Fits iPhone 6 well
1,Great charger.  I easily get 3+ charges on a Samsung Galaxy 3.  Works perfectly for camping trips or long days on the boat.
1,Great for the price :-)
1,"Great Case, better customer service!"
1,Easy to set up and use. Great functions for the price
1,Works great
1,So far so good. It is essentially identical to the one it replaced from another company. That one stopped working after 7 months so I am a bit apprehensive about this one.
0,"seems durable but these are always harder to get on right than people make them out to be. also send to curl up at the edges after a while. with today's smartphones, you hardly need screen protectors anyway."
1,"Super thin, lightweight, and non intrusive. Feels amazing, isn't add protective as other cases but I get to enjoy and show off my phone more."
1,"As good as the Samsung Galaxies, in my opinion."
1,"I received this on time and its great. I went on a long trip and used it. I have an iPhone 4 s a BLU Android phone and my husband has a small flip phone, it worked great on all of them and I also had a blue tooth I charged on it."
-1,Very cheap case. This not protect anything. Very fragil.!! After i got it I went to buy a otter case expensive but worth it.
1,son loves it.
-1,you have to turn power off to this unit once or twice a day to keep it working
1,"Awesome, thank you"
1,"nice, smart"
1,We love these headphones. We had a pair each for our 2 and 4 year old. They loved them and thought it was great that they could share one device but each have their own set of headphones. Very comfortable as well.
1,This is well worth the money.
-1,This cord didn't work at all
1,"Initial review after having this Kinivo for 48 hours?  This has been what I've been searching for the last few years trying to use a system to sync up my calls and music.  I've used the motorola tx550 (terrible), Satechi Soundfly BT, and numerous other failed devices.  I was not only able to set this up in literally under a minute, I was later able to completely hide all the wires under my dash which made me even happier.<br /><br />I will periodically update on this device."
1,"Great cords!! 10ft cords for this price? And they all work just fine, will buy these again!"
-1,The car plug in broke within a week of using it.
1,"Excellent addition to my alcatel one touch pop 7 ,,, case is attractive and we'll made, the keyboard works great with my tablet .. this product brings my tablet to a new level"
1,"Not bad. I LOVE these style of Bluetooth headsets. This one is slightly different from my very first pair I got over a year ago. They are the same shape but this one is not as finished as my current set.  The sound quality is not as clear as my QCY set but is pretty good. It has a nice balance of sound and the bass is sufficient. The sound quality is not like those expensive Beats or bose headphones, but it’s good enough for the price point. These go in the ear so it does block sound out. It blocks noise out so well that when I’m using these in the office, I can get more work done because I don’t hear the chatter of people around me.<br /><br />These use your standard micro usb cables so there’s no fear if you lose the cable that this set comes with. It charges up full in about an hour from dead and right out of the box it charged up in about 30 minutes. The battery life lasts me about 3 work days before needing to be recharged and that includes using it while on the way home from work which is a one hour minimum drive to and from the office.<br /><br />When using this for phone calls, you must leave the left ear piece hanging down around your neck. The microphone is on that earpiece. If you leave it in your ear, the person on the other end will not hear you clearly because the mic will be by your ear. The one thing this set is missing is a clip so you can clip that ear piece onto your collar for phone calls. If you’re like me and always moving around, if the earpieces shuffles around, the person on the phone can hear all the movement.<br /><br />Also, the volume button. It is very temperamental. When I try to hit volume up, I barely touch it and it adjusts volume. When I press down on it adjust volume it has a slow reaction. It’s almost like it works like a touch screen. Holding down the volume up and down buttons while listening to music will skip forward and back on your song list. With very minimal buttons, this is a very easy headset to use. It comes with an instructional booklet complete with photo to show you where the buttons and mic are.<br /><br />It comes with multiple ear pieces so you can change them out to the most comfortable size for you.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional sample for my honest review.s with an instructional booklet complete with photo to show you where the buttons and mic are.<br /><br />It comes with multiple ear pieces so you can change them out to the most comfortable size for you.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional sample for my honest review."
1,"Daughter couldn't go down the river without her phone, so we had to get a case.  This worked perfectly. Not so big that it was hard to carry, and kept the water out!  She keeps it in the bathroom now and uses it when she takes a bath.  Glad it works!"
1,"Foam not good, clips ok so far..."
-1,right after I posted favorable review I noticed it was broken.
1,very good
1,ok
1,"This product is nicer that I was expecting.  And, arrived early!"
1,the only reason i didn't give this 5 stars was that it was super tough to get on and off the phone. other than that it's a solid case and it worked to expectation. i dropped my phone a few times while using this case and the case held up.<br /><br />i was given this case at a discounted rate in return for an unbiased opinion.
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my brother who just got an Apple watch in July. He loves it! Being a person who works with wood, he especially loved the wood look, very pretty. It works quite well and was well-priced on Amazon."
1,excelente
1,The case fits perfectly on my Son's phone. Thanks for the fast shipment of the order.
-1,"It's okay. I like the dreamcatcher graphic a lot. The case itself is very thin and the edging on her sides is not seamless. The edges have a small plastic &#34;tail&#34; that is left over from when the case was cut. It's not horrible but it is noticeable and annoying.<br /><br />Not sure what I expected though, afterall its $5."
1,Great price and fast shipping highly recommended.
1,"I'm not going to tell you that you should buy this phone, I'll givethe pros and the cons and let you decide for yourself Pros &#34;Durable&#34;    I don't know if Lg of America purposely makes they're phones in America easy to break the screen but this one Right here is a champion. Dropped this on cement, Hard Tile floor, on the sidewalk, and a few Other non carpeted areas. I don't know if it's the construction itself that makes it strong or maybe that LG Of Korea purposely made this phone very strong since it's marketed to teens and younger folks, or maybe it's because every time you dropped the phone instead of it's falling all in one piece and absorbing all the Impact, the back comes off and the battery comes out oftentimes but when you put it back together it works fine. I even had a few front facing dropS so many times I thought oh my God this is it my phone is shattered but I was wrong I am so confident in this phone that I Could do a ear height drop test anytime anywhere and I'm 100 percent sure it won't break and I'm 5ft 10. I don't even have a case on it it's just the screen protector and that's it.  Good Conversation starter (The Eyes)  you have no idea how many conversations have started Because of this.  Me: *Takes my phone out of my pocket to see notifications*  Her: &#34;Omg, does your phone have eyes? Thats sooo cute&#34;  Me:yeah, it's a lil phone from Korea. The Lg aka. check it out it's eye's move too. It even blinks too Her: Thats so adorable, Im ******* by the way.  Continue talking and i ended up getting so many kiks/phone number because of that but i digress. (It's Still Corvette over females doe) A great way to break the ice.  Audio  The Sounds sounds great coming through the speakers no cracking or nothing like that, it's not super loud but if you put it at full volume here and enjoy it even if you're a good distance away. earbuds, it works with every pair of earbuds I have very compatible. Crisp .plus with the LG software their version of the music app you have the option to increase t, the treble, all that. I love that features some songs just don't sound the same without all that bass.let's see what else can I say about the sound? the notifications can be nice and loud. And yeah if you're really into music this is a great phone.  Design   if you are coming from some other company and you're used to the buttons on the sideit'll take a little while but eventually you'll get used to the volume rockers and power button being on the back. and if you don't want to have to deal with that this phone has knock knock you tap on the screen twice to wake it up and then you can enter your password and all that instead of using the little button on the back. and most of the time you can use the littles options At top to adjust the volume but as I said before it's pretty easy To get used to. Plus the phone looks nice, its not ugly.  Call quality The call quality is decent. I thought since this phone was from overseas the call Quality might be off but now it's on point. Texting works normally too .  The speed  if you are used to be mid-range phones, this is quite a little Speedy One.   The Flex factor  lots of people buy Phones As fashion statement, the question is if my  put his galaxy/iPhone/Note/ on the table and you put yo phone next to theirs how would it stack up? I would give this phone a 7. Its pretty nice and if you keep it clean(its easy,every not and again wipe wit a lil rubbing alcohol) you can flex on anyone. Looks like one of them $700 Flagships. If yo guy friends see the eyes however they might clown ya. But that don't matter. The eyes are cool to me and that's all that matter.  Security Lots of options to keep it safe. Bunch of lock options and it has lookout too.at least mine did you might have to install it.  accessories  If you like customization this phone comes with funny lil stickers to put on it. If you older you might not care but i found this cool.  Weight  Its not heavy. I likes this.   OsThe operating system is Kitkat, I personally like KitKat. it gets the job done and it doesn't have too many features that I'll never use thatll just drain my battery.  Memory   16 gigs of internal space . And thats good considering my other phone before this had 8 . Up to 32 gb with a memory card but I used a 64 gb chip and it's worked fine.  Auto focus lazer  Cool feature on the camera very useful. And it can shoot high resolution video  Battery   lasts a while. I can get 6 hours wifi on heavy use but if the brightness is at 100 you lose some up time. And if yiu get a replacement battery you can just switch it out bam.  Cons  Camera isn't highest quality. Kinda grainy.  Not waterproof/Water resistant. Thats how my broke. Not broke but it's messed up pretty bad.   Price. Depending on what color you get this can go up to be 300 dollars, them Amazon vendors tryna rip y'all off this a $200/$250 Phone don't be rash wait till the price go down.  Front facing camera is not that great either but you can see so its not complete trash.  Too much stuff. Too many apps pulling on the ram makes it studder occasionally. Not bad but you'll notice it.   5 inches. I came from 4.7 in, i though well .3 in isn't that big of a jump but I was wrong, sometimes I have difficulty reaching the top of the screen to pull down my notification thing. Not the phone fault my hands just wasn't  for 5 in.   Micro sim. I had a regular sim. But its alright T-Mobile switch it and gave me a new one free.  I lied at the start. You should buy this if you think it's cool"
1,love it
-1,Bought a puretalk prepaid sim card for this phone and the phone does not work/connect to the network. Lame...
1,"&#34;This a great looking and highly functional case for the iPhone 6.It is a nice solid construction and doesn't add too much bulk to the phone.The case is a little stiff and not that easy to separate.You need to follow the instruction carefully.You should  remove screen protectors at first.<br />You are advised to test the case for waterproofness by placing a piece of paper in the case then dunking it in water. This I did with no problems, the paper was bone dry All the ports are sealed with stoppers so it should be completely sealed.<br />The buttons were still easy to press with the case on and the fingerprint sensor works perfectly;<br />All in all, I like this case and recommend it. &#34;"
1,"This is my 8th time buying one of these. Not because they don't last, but because everyone always thinks they are cool and I let them have it. Love the fact that you can turn anything with an AUX input to Bluetooth!"
1,Its annoyingly good at reminding me to get up and move.  Wish it would track 'movement' as well as steps.. and of course I wish it had a vibrate feature. but so far so good.
0,Best quality
1,I liked the macro lens the most. So sharp! I gave it 4 stars because the wide angle had so much vignette. But this thing is totally worth the money! Works in Sony Xperia z3 compact.
1,"As past reviewers had indicated, it is a bit bulky and the connections are not tight, but it works."
1,"fits perfect. doesn't interfere with pockets and purse much. clear color lets me see phone, which I wanted!"
1,Good protection.
1,"Fantastic case. Looks slick as can be. The hard buttons remain fully functional. Only reason it doesn't get a 5 is that the case is very difficult to remove, and also, the input for the charger will not fit all chargers. Otherwise, it's a beautiful case."
1,"Very sturdy, keeps phone nice and safe!"
0,"They sounded okay, they had plenty of the skipping that is all too well known with bluetooth headphones, very difficult for me to get the right fit with these. I wanted to like these headphones, but the Blue Buds X were just a hands down winner, the Blue Buds just have too many better features to go with freedoms instead. Durability wise, only time will tell. But these freedoms weren't as good sounding to me, the ear hooks were not as comfortable as I was expecting, I also prefer the Blue Buds due to their smaller size. The price is higher, I bit the bullet and bought them and I am so much happier with them than I was with the cheaper alternatives. I use the Comply Foam Tips and they improve any set of headphones dramatically in My opinion."
1,Great
-1,I just received mine and it was broken I didn't even get to use it! !!!!! Horrible care!
1,"Nice product.  Does, as advertised.  Getting used to not carrying a wallet and only carrying necessary with me."
1,"Fits perfectly. Saved my iPhone from getting damaged quite few times, forcing me to keep using.<br />Though the case is a lot slippery i liked it more than the leather one I bought at Apple Store.<br />Looks not compromised.<br />Phone feels lot slimmer. No weight added.<br />Overall great case :)"
0,Case is pretty decent nice snug fit on my phone but the kick stand on the phone is really difficult to use.
1,is awesome
-1,Not what I expected at all.  Online description misleading.  Gave it away for my son to play with  don't waste your money
1,Everything was great. Thank you.
1,"Quality is not great but for the price is completely acceptable. Very cool design and zipper works easily; cloth cord does not tangle much. Bought these mostly for the cool and anti-tangle design, very pleased with it. Would be 5 star if not for the sound quality but I would buy these again if I needed another pair of cheap earbuds to toss in a bag and take out without having to spend ten minutes detangling them."
-1,"Doesn't work on my iPad Air. Would not advised purchasing this product. I have tried different charging bricks and it's the same thing, I get a message that my iPad is not charging."
0,"This case did not work with aftermarket charger cords; but to clarify they did work with my cords purchased from Apple. I had to notch out the openings a bit to get the aftermarket cord to fit. Otherwise, durable and dependable."
1,I love my case
-1,Is rubbing off
-1,It's good for its price but does not last long.
1,Great case! Fits perfectly even with a tempered glass screen protector. It does add bulk to the phone but makes it easier to carry which is a huge plus :) Lime green is a fantastic color.
-1,"The screen protector was not wide enough, did not fit phone properly!! :/"
0,"I'm 50/50 about this product. It's not bad, but I wish it would've been a bit more durable and less thin plastic-y."
1,"Excellent product, fast shipping!!!"
1,After seeing and using ours a friend asked that I get one for her as well - This is a great charger and a great buying experience.
1,Don't give a bad review because you didn't do the research and ordered the wrong part.
-1,The part that connects to the tablet broke after the first use. No kidding. The part that is important is actually the weakest part. I was so disappointed. The cord looked so high quality and beautiful.
1,Product acceptable. Sturdy
1,"It take a little to instal, but it works perfectly. I works with my Amazon Echo."
-1,Glass shattered during installation. There is no protective cover on the front side of the glass to protect it during installation on the device.  The instructions on the package do not correspond to the actual contents of the box for installation.  Overall poor installation instructions.  I have no idea who the product performs as I never made it that far.<br /><br />I have installed several Zagg glass screen protectors and never had one break before.  This brand is well below the quality of Zagg Glass.  The only reason I tried this brand is that Zagg does not make one for the Kindle HD 7.  A very disappointing result.
1,Fast delivery.  Easy to apply!
1,Love it
1,"Good cassette adapter.<br />My husband and I just bought a Subaru OUtback 2002 with CD and cassette players.<br />We were afraid to try this to plug our cell phones into the car stereo, because some reviews say that it completely damaged the car sound system, but so far, we've been using for 4 days and , it has been working in a very good way.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't like, which prevented me for putting 5 stars, it was a small interference sound when I move the cell phone. That is all."
1,Good product.  Please note that it is not a floating case.  They don't claim it is but I somehow was thinking it was.  It is a good price and does what it says.
1,I love it. Item is exactly as described and pictured.
-1,i have to return this
1,Love the price for a great product
-1,The box was alright but after a short while the box starts falling apart and it rattles about ten times louder than the actual sub. Ruins the listening experience majorly. Ended up putting in screws throughout most of the box and still can not find the source of the rattling exactly.
1,"It took a little time for me to write this review because I prefer to try a product out completely over time. I did have a problem with the cable, the camera would shut off when the car was in motion and I would have to screw around with the connector to get it to turn on again, after a few miles it would shut off again, this was corrected when I notified the company which promptly sent me a new cable. The problem now seems to be fixed. About the camera itself...it's a really good little camera, the picture is really clear and the colors are very natural. This camera rivals many more expensive models. Take a look at the YouTube videos, they speak for themselves. The only problem I have (with any of these cameras) is, the setting buttons are really small, for a man's hands that can be a problem, but other than that I really don't have any other complaints with this camera. It does what it was designed to do. The company is really nice to deal with if you do have a problem, like with any electronic device, things can and do go wrong sometimes, but this company responds quickly to rectify a problem which keeps their costumers happy. Over all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this very reasonably priced camera to any one looking to purchase a car camera. When an accident happens, and they do, it's nice to have a visual account to protect yourself. This is a very sensible purchase for anyone."
1,The best phone case I ever bought!
-1,"I bought this charger because it was long and apple certified and from Amazon. However, I have had it for about a month and now no longer works because it is says it isn't apple certified which is the way it is described in the name of the product. I hope the company can send me a new iPhone charger because this one is no longer working."
1,"Works as described.  I bought it to have earphones with some noise blocking capability for use on a tractor.  I have ear-bud phones which block noise and these block better with better sound and no more gooey-squishy-sweat in my ear canals.  I have paired it with 2 tablets (one android, one Windows) and my phone all easily.  Good sound quality. Does not block enough outside sound to serve as hearing protection, nor would I expect it to, but it is close and works well for my needs in a tractor which isn't very loud.<br /><br />Pros:  Good sound quality.  Voice notifications lets you know on/off/pairing.  Comfortable (fits fully over my ears).  Range; I tried pairing to my phone when outside ready to hit the tractor and it wouldn't do it....came to realize it was still connected inside to my tablet which I had to go inside to disconnect.  Nice compact case.<br />Cons:  At this price point I can't complain.  The USB charger cable is unique and may be difficult to replace (USB to mic jack). They feel &#34;flimsy&#34; but then that means they are lightweight and comfortable for work-use or long games.<br />Unknowns:  I haven't run the battery dead yet to know run time; at least a few hours.  Microphone; haven't tried it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  when these wear out I will get another pair.  I will probably buy two more for my kids for road trips as they have systematically destroyed the &#34;wire&#34; with each wired set that I have bought them."
-1,"I wanted to transfer pictures, but it did not work.  What I actually needed was a memory card."
1,Very good quality for the price.
-1,Didn't realize it has an internal fan.  Pretty noisy.  Embarrassing to use in conference room with others.
0,Ok
1,works well.  Can charge my iPad as well as my phone on one charge.  Very handy to take on a trip.
1,"Gives my phone that same iPhone modern look but is unique, lots of compliments already."
1,Great product. Works well.
1,"I am VERY happy with this holder.  The suction mount and positioning abilities are very high quality.  I use a 5.5 inch screen phone and a thin, hard-shell case.  The thin, metal plate fits easily between the back of my phone and its case, and it holds very firmly on the TechMatte's magnet.  I don't need the gripper portion, although it is also very nice quality.  And while it holds firmly, it also comes off when I want to grab my phone.<br />What I like the most about this mount is the ability to quickly put the phone on, or take it off with one hand and no fumbling about.  You can place the phone on it lengthwise, or straight up and down without difficulty.  Once on, the phone doesn't move while I'm driving through any turns, stops, or bumps.  It's just plain easy, reliable and functional.<br />The mount's suction cup is the best I've ever used -- and I've used many over the years.  It'll hold firm on any windshield, or on a dashboard horizontal pad.  The angle adjustments are easy to use, also high quality, and they hold firmly once in place.<br />This product is absolute proof of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  Sure, you can get a cheaper Chinese knock-off on Ebay...but it won't be anything nearly as good.  I'm sold.  I'll be happy with this system for years.  I will likely purchase more as gifts for my kids this Christmas."
1,Saved myself from getting the apple band
1,Great case...but when i clean my home phone button with awesome spray it touches lil bit of casing frame and all suden change color for that particular part
1,"This case for the GoPro is perfect for two cameras and accessories. It will protect your gear very well without weighing you down, especially if you are traveling."
1,Works well and the replacement tips make it a worthy investment.
1,I ordered two of these about 1.5 months ago. The first one did not work correctly right out of the box. Would not even charge my smart phone one time before running out of juice.<br />On the second unit the power button fell off after only a few weeks. I am very disappointed in these.<br /><br />Update:  After writing the previous review the manufacturer reached out to me and offered to send me replacements.  This was outstanding customer service and in every way makes up for the previous shortcomings.<br /><br />The new chargers both are functioning flawlessly and have neither issue the previous chargers had.  I am not very happy with my purchase.
1,Exactly as described and depicted in the photo
-1,"I ordered one and it's really pretty I love the decoration but within one day of having it, the corner was cracked and I didn't even drop my phone. So I ordered the free replacement and I had it for about a week an it's already chipped out of the bottom corner and again, I haven't dropped my phone."
1,Looks great. Functions nicely.
-1,"Did not test if it is actually waterproof but this case is very flimsy. The door for the charger port snapped off and the plastic base cracked. I went through two of these in a month. For a better quality case, get an Otterbox. If you want to take pictures underwater, just get a waterproof camera. I wouldn't risk breaking a $600 phone but if you want to..."
1,love this product. Protected my phone for 2 years without peeling off. Had to change my phone and this is the first thing I bought for it. Must have!
1,"This mount is excellent. Easy to use, stays in place without any slipping (about two weeks of use at this point), and could clearly accommodate most types of phones. Highly recommended."
0,"I like the style, I have a large head but these fit and stay in place, and they're cheap (notice I said cheap, not inexpensive).<br /><br />If they didn't cost so little (especially for wireless) I would rate lower but for $23 I got what I paid for.  They'll replace my corded headset for doing physical work but only because I've had it with ripping corded phones out of my ears. They won't replace my corded phones while at the office though.<br /><br />The drivers lack bass and there's a slight tunnel effect to the audio.  This is however my first Bluetooth headset so that may be typical. These are meant for wireless convenience and I'll give the sound quality a pass at this price point - they do what is necessary of them.  All of the buttons besides the MFB are conveniently placed and easy to use, but the MFB button is located towards the inside of the earbud instead of the back so you have to almost pull the the earbud out to access it - especially with the rubber &#34;waterproofers&#34; installed.<br /><br />I can't attest yet to the battery life.  If they last 5 hours at a time I'll be happy.<br /><br />The start/stop feature stops working occasionally and I have to unlock my phone before I can stop the music from the headset.  This may be an issue with my phone though, a Moto G first-gen.<br /><br />And finally the rubber buds were all but useless.  In the attached picture you'll see of the buds that came on the headphones (to the farthest right in the picture), one was larger (top) than the other (bottom).  And then the other 2 sets were defective in that the &#34;rim&#34; that attaches to the stem of the headphones is at the front of the earbuds instead of the back.  For instance if you look at the earbuds to the right of the picture (the ones that came on the headset) you'll notice (or not) the black rim is in the back.  But the other 2 sets (left and center) you'll notice the front of the buds are dark - that is the rim which is supposed to be in the back.So these other 2 sets only attach if you put them on backwards, i.e. with the &#34;output&#34; hole onto the stem.  I docked a star for this and thought about RMA'ing but because of shipping/handling charges and the fact that I have other rubber buds from other sets I've purchased in the past, I didn't bother.<br /><br />I was hoping for more but got about what I expected.  My biggest disappointment was in the defective rubber buds."
1,"Works and looks great. Charging is a bit slow, but I use it to charge my phone overnight on the night stand."
-1,So so
1,This is a very nice quality charger.  It works great and looks good doing it.
1,"Does exactly what it should, and seems much better than the plastic film type.. worth it!"
-1,Sorry just not what I expected
1,Nice and good work..
1,It was an okay case and the back is really crystal clear
1,"Best investments iPhone case wise. No longer do I carry my wallet and cash. Just my DL, American Express and 2 Debit cards."
0,"Bought this unit to use in our travel trailer, as I assumed the RV-special features would keep us on the best roads.  Not so!  In just two weeks of use, this thing has told me to &#34;leave the road&#34; twice, and taken me to a gas station that hasn't been a gas station in years.  The first time I used it, I was in a familiar area, and if I hadn't known that the GPS was trying to take me down horse path (literally) I'd have been in trouble. I'm pretty disappointed at the accuracy, and the database is just 'so-so'.  And, it took 14 hours to &#34;update&#34; the database from my USB on my computer, which I did right out of the box.  May have been my PC (I don't think so), but that big of an update made me think it'd be accurate in terms of closed facilities and road accesses.  It's not.<br /><br />The feature that I do like is having rest stops, truck stops and available bathroom stops at the touch of a button (even if they're not terribly accurate), so we're going to keep the thing, rather than return it.<br /><br />I now run both this mediocre thing AND my Google Maps navigation on the smartphone at the same time, 'cause I don't completely trust the Garmin, but Maps doesn't have the one-touch access for stopping points.  Wish there was one unit that did everything we wanted... hard to believe in this age of technology that there isn't... :-("
1,"Good goggles without the frill of the later versions.  I have not compared to other cardboard goggles, but I would guess these are relatively high quality lenses, with plastic frames instead of cardboard.  I did not have any problems using them.  The lack of a visor to block outside light was not an issue.  I did feel a little carsick, though.  Because of the carsickness, I do not regret the lack of a headband.  My arms do not get tired from holding the apparatus for the short periods I feel comfortable using it.  And it feels more natural to be holding it to your face while turning around, rather than relying on a headband to hold cardboard against your face."
-1,We have tried all of the cords in the pack.  They seem to work a couple of times and then they don't charge any longer. Really disappointed!
1,Perfect sound like LG
1,"My daughter bought this for me, about 2 weeks ago.  This is a really great way to keep track of your activity level, especially since I am now semi-retired.  It gives me an extra nudge to &#34;get up, and keep moving.&#34;  I'm actually enjoying it more than I thought I would."
-1,I really liked this product. Very smooth feel - even better than actual screen. Which is strange because you would never say that about a condom. Anywho my opinion changed when a 36&#34; fall from my desk onto carpet caused the screen protector to crack. Very delicate.
1,Thanks
0,I had a little trouble with fit.  It's okay. I feel that my phone is well protected.
1,"nice phone,"
1,Good strong. Hope it holds up!
1,great little organizer. very solid and attractive
-1,The clap broke 😑
0,It's alright.
1,great product
-1,Works for 3 months and tip of cable stock in my phone. Contact saler told me have to ship the defectid item and then they raplace it. Not worth to buy
1,Cute and it's not bulky at all.
0,"First off, the seller was Great. Item arrived in a very timely manner. The actual materials of this 3 piece case appear to be very rugged. The only exception might be the belt clip (time will tell). However, once you put the silicone gel around the phone, then proceed to slide the phone into the middle bracing part, you have no way to avoid putting stress on the volume rocker and power buttons. You just have to work those buttons into the cutouts. If, like me, you choose to use the belt clip case, inserting and removing the phone can be a challenge. At first, I found myself accidentally taking screen shots because of the pressure being put on the power and volume rocker buttons while sliding the phone in and out of the belt clip case (very tight). Plus the gel covering tends to fold up when pulling phone out. The solution? Well, this is a &#34;flip screen phone,&#34; so I just put it into the belt clip case right side up even though I would rather put it in right side down (The reason: hand down at side to hand up at ear. Results when I pull the phone out, the phone goes from right side down in case to right side up at ear). Overall Pros: 1) Material used appear to be very durable. 2) Kickstand seems to work very well. Overall Cons: 1) Phone is tight in belt clip. 2) Silicone gel gets a lot of friction when putting in and pulling out of belt clip case. 3) Although silicone gel cover has some notches on the sides, feels a little slick. 4) Molded area for earphone plug isn't big enough for a complete flush connection. ... On a sidenote, I accidentally purchased the same two cases from two different sellers, thought I was ordering two DIFFERENT cases (my bad). Once again, not the worst case but could be better. Nothing against either seller, they were great!"
1,Works Great!
1,"I wish the bottom and top edges were a little more rigid, but the case works great. Fits great and very slim."
1,I have been concerned about radiation (EMF and EMR) for some time now. This product blocks the radiation and was inexpensive and effective. I am very satisfied.
-1,Fit well but looked like water under part of the shield. I threw it away.
0,Not easy to open or close
1,Great product. Works like a charm! Highly recommend this seller.
1,Bought this case for my daughters phone.  She seems very happy with it so far.
1,First one was defective but power add replaced right away and everything great now.  Thanks Poweradd!
1,All good. I ordered several of these and they are great.
-1,"If I could, I will give it 0 star. I bought 2 days ago and was very happy to receive today. But when I opened it and found it was made in 2013. After installation, the battery was 34% full, 30 minutes later, it became 14% full. Then I used IbackupBot to check and found the battery already has 508 count cycles.  I can accept I bought a brand new defect product, but I can not accept I bought a used product when it was claimed &#34;brand new&#34;."
1,"Very nice, smooth to touch. I usually have problems with regular plastic screen protectors. I accidentally scratch those, a bit of it will come off but since the matte is so smooth, it's impossible to scratch. Comes with three also so it's worth it!"
-1,"Loose connections, flimsy quality. Charger continues to drop out."
-1,They is the really poor quality<br />Falls were not<br />4 corners broken down
0,Needs to be worked with Audacity.  which is cumbersome to work with.
1,Shipping was slow but good product
1,Very impressed with this case. It was exactly what I wanted without any of the added bulk other cases seem to have. It went on easy and fits the phone snug. It was exactly what I wanted!
1,Nice that it doubles as a wallet.
1,Works great
0,Didn't protect the front. It was ok. Bought s better case. Def not worth $10
1,Durable case on construction site!
1,Cute and does what it says!
1,Excellent seller.<br />100% recommended.<br />Thank you
1,I LIKE THEM !!!
1,Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
-1,"I did not like it, it barely fit felt cheesy and it broke on me the next day"
1,My order came in promptly  and very happy with the purchase.
1,Great Product!<br />It holds my phone in place and it does not slip off or anything.<br />Definitely recommend.
1,great one i like it
1,"This is the 3rd time I have purchased the SwitchEasy Numbers case. It provides just enough protection without adding too much bulk to the iPhone 6+.  And it's the only case I know of that covers the power and headphone ports - important for me because I carry my phone in my pocket and the covers keep the lint out.  A little extra work when you want to charge your phone or connect to your car stereo, but totally worth it!"
-1,Don't waste your money or time buying them. They are fake and the connection is terrible. They don't stay charged long at all.
1,perfect for what I needed
-1,The backing is made out of a rubber material that rubs when I run
1,Just what I needed for my phone!
1,"Nice and sturdy, not cheap. Fits perfectly"
1,good product
1,I've purchased many items through Amazon and have never left reviews. This will be my first review in over 5 years because they are so good. I bought them to wear with my phone so I don't have a cord jammed between my fingers.  I compared the prices of other Web sites and went to best buy and these were the cheapest. I was expecting much less than what I received.  Well made with lots of ear fittings.<br />I've used some beats before and these are right up there with the sound quality. Expecially if your watching movies. I use them all the time and am extremely satisfied.
1,"This is an almost indestructible plastic cover, and almost no bubbles.  My copy created a permanent bubble around the rear-facing camera, I think because of the camera indention.  The OEM protector was cut around that camera.<br /><br />The first one arrived badly smashed - this is a ridged piece, not a thin film, and someone sat something heavy on it in-transit.  The second was intact and I like it.  It replaced the wimpy one that came on the phone, and within weeks had scratches on it.<br /><br />Forget those three-packs of thin film, this is the kind of protector that works.  Wonder if they make one for a Nikon...."
-1,"Earphones only lasted a week before the cord started to fray and the wires become exposed.  Before that they were staticky and lost sound in one ear if I moved the device at all.  Unbelievable.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Waiting for a replacement pair of DECENT earphones now, will never buy these again."
0,"There is always a slight buzzing but they are very comfortable to wear, I got them to listen to before I go to sleep so it isn't a huge deal."
1,Works perfect in my iPhone playing music thru my Aux in 2010 ToyotaTacoma.
1,I love this case. A great way to keep your phone charged as well as protecting it. Definitely recommend!!
-1,It was cheaply made
-1,awful case. the screen protector got dust between it and the adhesive on the protector came loose within 3 weeks. the plastic inner part of the case started cracking and I didn't even drop it yet! I can't return it now that it is broken but i wish i could. Im just going to get an otter box commuter for better quality.
1,Love this!
1,Great radio for the price. Awesome when it's paired with an apple device. Has a few small quirks but I can only imagine an upcoming update would take care of it. Tons of settings and user friendly.
-1,"Pro: Size is convenient. Looks cool but not very functional.<br />Cons: Would not stay in my ears, I should not have to struggle just to get it in my ears. It should be as simple as 1,2,3, Go. Not, put it in, possible use a mirror to help with the positioning, hook the ear piece thing and hope it doesn't fall out when you actually start moving. Buttons are tiny, hard to feel when you want to change the volume. Also feels like it is raping my ear canal every time I need to move it ! No thanks, I'll stick with my LG's."
1,Just finished using it while on a trip. Loved being able to keep my tablet operating while in flight.  It also indicates how much power is left.  No guessing game here.  Automatically turns off after using.
-1,Stopped working after a month
1,Beautiful cover very sturdy!
0,"These ear buds work as expected and the battery life is great, however the cords that attach the ear buds to the unit are too short even with the o-rings that secure them rolled back as far as they will go.  They are not so short that I cannot use the headseat, but they are short enough that I sometimes notice an annoying tug."
1,They are ok.
1,Love the look!
0,"It's a good looking case, but the clear window becomes scratched so easily that the case looks old before it's time. The good news is that it works with the charging pads better than my other case.<br /><br />The buttons are smooth on the sides and do not provide any tactile feedback. With gloves on, you cannot tell if you have pressed a button or not. So many times you will turn the screen on and off a couple times in a row. It's a decent case for a decent price."
1,Love it works great
1,It was what I expected
-1,"This case help if you just drop your phone, it does not protect prom the water at all, but on the box it says that this case can protect your phone under water around 6 feet deep for a 1 hour. This case is just waist of money. And yeah, they doesn't replace my phone, they just send me a new case. Why do I need a new case if my phone is not working?"
1,Sounds pretty darn good. Could use a little more bass but for $20 it blows away everything else I've listened to
-1,Not for the phone but was able to make it work
-1,Horible!
1,I love this charger! I've been using it for over a month now and it's still intact and working well. I needed a long cable and this is what I've been looking for.
-1,Wont work for my smartphone. Returned immediately!
1,good
1,Loved my new case..was right color. ..fit nicely on my phone. .arrived on time
1,Love this case. It is made well. I've had it on my iPhone 5C for a long time. I have dropped it several times and it is protected and not broken yet.
1,"I love my Mvp pro 3.0 is a very good battery. There is some this to observe:  1 - I've bought this battery as a kit on Amazon 2 times from other seller and never came with the sub g tank so I bought again from this seller on the option with no tank and retuned the previous items.  2 - it's perfect for most of the tanks but you can read on the manual that will not do coils under 0.4 ohm. So pay attention on that!  3 - it's very easy to use, press the button 3 times to turn it on.  4 - always read the manuals online before to buy it or use it, follow the manual from your coils online to see how much voltage they can handle.  5 - never charge this device on the car or with cheap cables, it's not going to charge cause have protection against bad quality charges."
-1,"Expected the case to be of slightly better quality and the graphics on the phone to be more vivid but when I got it, the case looked very cheap and not to my liking. However, you get what you paid for."
1,Husband loves it -  Has it on his golf cart.
0,Cute but cheap.
1,Great for on the go. Its a bit smaller then my S6 works great and charges my phone fast..I have done the charging of two phones at once and did not have to charge them both together.
1,"Just received my Skiva lightning cable and LOVE IT! It is made of a nice sturdy material, not the rubbery kind that usually falls apart quickly. It charged my phone quick and is a nice length. I don't have amazon prime and it was shipped extremely quickly. It even comes with a 1 year warranty."
1,"Arrived very quickly.  Was exactly what I expected.  Works well.  The only thing is you need to push a button to move the leg to the desired position which is fine, but if you do not push the button you could break.  After knowing this it is very easy to set to desired angle."
-1,stylus  doesn't fit in note 4 opening
-1,Works until the accessory is not accepted on the iphone. I got maybe a months worth of use out of these before the iphone started rejecting the plug.
1,"Reviewing cables is silly. This does exactly what you'd expect. It is a good build quality, not flimsy."
-1,stolen phone
1,Love it!
1,good
-1,Did not charge!!
1,"My son loves these, I was impressed with the quality and features. I have had no problems, but the customer support team still reaches out to make sure everyone is enjoying the product."
-1,I haven't even had it that long and the white paint is already chipping off the whole case.
0,Returned it worked great but it showed an optional headset attachment which wasn't compatible with this model. I wanted the option to use this either way.
1,Great
-1,"Did not work at all. I bought 2 of them. They did not hold a charge, and I had it in full sun. Don't buy this product. Not worth it."
-1,This phone worked for 1 week fine and after that started to reboot itself and to not recognize the sim card. DO NOT BUY IT FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!
1,great item
-1,could not use has no grip constantly slipping out of my hand
0,"Does it work? yes. Is it spotty? not the biggest deal, BUT, it makes a horrific high pitched noise when plugged in.If you have good hearing I wouldn't buy unless you want headaches, if your hearing is spotty, go for gold."
0,"Works, but destroys the edges of the Face ArmorShield..."
1,Great price and excellent service.
1,The original broke after about a month. I emailed Anker and they sent out a brand new one no questions asked within two days of our conversation. This is why i love Anker and always stick with them!
1,"Absolutely adore this case. Cute color, easy storage. Wish the front part of the case was white or same color blue though."
-1,low quality earbuds! They do not stay in the ear! cheaply made!
1,held up to a few drops and scratches. cheaper to replace this then the whole screen.
1,love this.  life changing item.  really cool and pretty sturdy.  A+
1,"As a phone user, we all come across the issue of our phones dwindling battery life. On the go, it can be an immense problem if you come to the point of minimal battery life, and you don't have the tool to fix that, especially in emergency circumstances. Car chargers like this are of great help, because they allow you to secure your phone's battery life, while not taking up extensive amounts of space that could obstruct your tasks of shifting gears, etc. The product is very durable and well made, and it is not of cheap material. I highly recommend this for people who are on the go, but have important tasks to complete through phone usage."
1,"My husband and I got this before a trip recently. It was so useful and we are so glad we had it! Whenever our phone batteries got low, we plugged them into this power bank and they charged right up. The unit has a lot of power and is perfect for airplanes or day trips when you don't have constant access to a charger. We didn't have to conserve our phone batteries and were able to use our phones as we normally would, taking pictures, checking email, etc.  It has a little pouch that it fits into which was convenient. It is kind of an awkward size and would be inconvenient to carry around if you don't have a bag or a purse, since you need to have charging cables as well. I always carry large purses, so this wasn't a problem for us.  I like that this power bank has a power switch as well, and it tells you how much battery remains. It has a flashlight on it as well, which I don't think we really have used, but I guess it would be nice for trying to plug in your phone in the dark. We charged this power bank every night (by plugging it into the wall) and always had enough power for 2 smart phones throughout the day. So convenient that you can plug 2 devices in at once.  If you can get this for a good price, I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this portable battery charger to anyone who uses their phone constantly!"
1,"Fast shipping, and love the phone case.  Exactly what I was expecting is what I got."
1,Super cute. Serves its purpose. very feminine and dainty.
1,I bought this case for my phone. I absolutely love it. I've had it about 6 myhs now and all the lil bling diamonds are all still in tact!!  💜
-1,"They didnt work, and poor packaging"
1,Great length and works!
1,"This fits over the Galaxy S6 Edge perfectly, without the added frustration of trying to stuff in an inner rubber bumper. Dropped it several feet while bike riding, and the case has a small dirty dent; but the phone is still in perfect condition. I haven't had the time to make my own backings, but the benefit of being able to change it whenever I want is awesome. While not a game changer; I just wish the website had a digital template to work off of instead of a flimsy paper stencil."
1,"A great phone considering the price! Battery life is somewhat limited, but overall performance is excellent. The upgrade to Lollipop sent flawlessly and the phone has no other real issues."
-1,"I really like these headsets, the fit well, and sound really good, the problem is that both pairs I ordered had the same problem, after a bout two weeks of use, they stopped taking a charge resulting in about five minutes of use when powering them on. Too bad."
1,"First day and so far I'm loving this.  I watched the video, read the directions and had no problem installing it.  The screen looks clear and perfect."
1,"The rubber case is thin but you always get what you pay for. If you want your watch just to look cute with minimal protection against scratches then get this one but if you're going to drop your watch then i'd say get a little more hardcore case. I love it though, happy with my purchase! might get a different color!"
1,Quality looks good and prompt postage. You can't argue based on the good price.<br />Would be happy to recommend to others.
1,"I am notorious for losing my charger and having a dead or dying phone.  It can be especially frustrating when I need to make an important phone call or have to leave the house and I have an uncharged phone in the case of an emergency.  Having this backup battery charger can be so convenient!  It is so easy to use.  I plugged it up via usb to my laptop right out of the package to make sure that it was fully charged and then I just tossed it right into my purse.  I always know where it is and when I need to charge my phone with it I can just plug it up the the included cord and drop it right back into my purse.  It does a great job of quickly charging up my phone.  I like the red color!  The charger features a stip of 4 blue lights that light up both when the unit is being charged and when the unit is charging my device.  There is a really neat feature about this power bank that is unlike others I have used, it has a little, but bright, flashlight on it!  Just click the power button twice and it turns on.  I thought that was pretty neat and unique.  Overall, I am happy with the product and its performance.  I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,It charges almost as fast as the Samsung fast chargers. Very good product!
1,"Works great with my iPad Mini. Would give it a 5 star except the dang thing doesn't stay put on the top on the mini. Not a major problem, a piece of Double stick foam tape and a rubber band solved the problem. I like it and I use it and would buy again for this price.<br />For the design engineers reading this ... if you had put a small &#34;dummy&#34; tab that fit into the contact slot on the top next to where this plugs in ... it would be perfect and not move about."
0,"It's a good charger, anything larger than a Nexus 5 slides off of it."
1,Soooooo Cute
1,"So far i love this case.  Not bulky, protects phone from my clumsiness, and the case fits the phone perfectly.  It's not flashy.  Just right for me.  Delivery of the product was prompt.  No issues.  Quality good."
1,Love this case. It has been one of the best cases I've had!!!
-1,very bad quality
1,"This case has done it's job, as I have dropped my phone multiple times and no harm has been done. The only thing I don't care for is how dirty the part around the edge (mint green part) looks. I've tried cleaning it with cleaning products and it appears to be permanently stained."
1,love how loud it is even with out amp... hooked to cb and scared the hell out of everyone i yelled at .... small so its easy to put anywhere on truck..... id buy more if needed
1,Its great...
0,It was highly advertised that it doesn't give you any annoying error messages and guess what it does.  The length of the cords are great.
1,thank you
-1,"I could not get it to work, Returned for full credit and purchased another pproduct."
-1,Poor quality only lasted three weeks
-1,"Poor quality, would like a refund or a new one sent to me, till the nexus 5 2015 is available"
-1,Doesn't hold a charge sometimes hard to hear
1,"Can't go wrong with an OEM charger.  In this case, I purchased it as a spare charger for my new Samsung S5"
1,"Battery and charger are great. There is no issues with it. I like how fast the charger is. It is well worth the money and the battery is oem. Overall,  great value."
-1,Don't work got my phone wet when it feel in the water.
1,Bought this part for my friend who has an issue with his camera. He was able to fix it and works better than his original camera.
1,"Cool cover. I really like how it fits the phone. You take the original back case off of the phone and then this one snaps on.  Only problem is that I am worrked it may break along the seam. Other than that, it is good."
1,Works great.
0,"I am unable to use it sine I do not have a iPhone. So, I will be returning it shortly."
1,great product!
1,Came extremely quick! I love this case!! Buy this!!
1,Product arrived on time and I'm very happy with the quality of the case fits securely on my One+1
1,Awsome
-1,"It's a nice design, nice colors, but it does add a significant amount of bulk. And it doesn't feel like the front and back pieces lock securely. It feels like if I were to drop my phone the case would fall apart.<br />I wouldn't buy this product again."
1,Great product! Arrived early and exactly as advertised!
1,Bought this for my daughter. Love it!
1,"True to color. And the best part is its made out of a good material. It's very durable. I always drop my phone, so this case helps me many times so I didn't have to get a new phone."
-1,Does not fit the screen fully really disappointed
1,"Have bought several of these now, they're awesome. I travel with one, use another in the car when several of us are traveling (car has a AC plugin), have one at my desk, nightstand, and now in my living room."
0,"Delivery was quick; however, I almost sent it back because it would not charge at all.  I used every charger/cord combo I could find in our house (believe me that is a lot), and just before I gave up, it took the charge and has performed well since. I looked at user reviews for cheaper units, and decided to pay more for this one to get a better product with the Samsung name, model, etc, so I was a little disappointed at first. I did find it odd that the manufacturing date of 2010.08.13 was older than the one that came in my phone 2010.10.27, but now that it works, I guess I'm OK with it."
1,"Really, really happy with this case, especially for the price paid. It slips on easily and stays on snugly, while still giving my iPhone that sleek feel. Love it!"
1,Great price and works.
0,"Does not fit a 1995 Blazer 2 door. Both the Amazon car checker and Crutchfield showed this was correct. The correct one for a 1995 Blazer 2 door is Metra 72-4500, they fit the door speakers and the rear quarter panel 6 x 9 speakers. I thought maybe they would fit the dash speakers, they do not fit there either. FYI."
-1,the gps103b is not working as an alarm. it is responding to sms request but not  to key fob or any input from sensors.
1,"Fits great, looks cool and slim.Haven't dropped phone yet to see how well it protects."
1,very good performance and noce price
-1,"I bought my glass screen protector, amd it is really disappointing. I don't do things that are particularly hard on phones, just normal adult use and my first one cracked within weeks. I got a replacement for the $5.99 shipping charge, and within weeks, it is cracked in multiple places again. The phone is never without a case either for protection from falls and such. The only conclusion I can draw is the protector itself is flawed in some way"
1,"Love this case I am even gonna look and see if they h ave any other styles, seems very durable as I very rarely drop my phone but the other day I stood up to greet someone forgetting my phone was on my lap and it fell on to concrete, everything A-Okay !!!!!  I would recommend this case for the simple fact I have been very happy with it and it survived the fall."
0,I ordered 10 foot cables and these cables are only 9'9&#34;  should not be advertised as 10 foot
1,Love the design. I'm hard on my phone and case fell apart.
1,Very nice looking watch
-1,"The unit I received appeared to be refurbished, as there was no plastic film on the screen and the screen had some minor mars and scratches.  I could have lived with that; however the unit kept randomly turning itself off.  I checked all the connections, and they were tight.  So I am returning it for a replacement, which I hope will function properly."
1,"I make and sell greeting cards to benefit our local library, and this Cottage Cutz two-piece mini frog die looks cute on my favorite anniversary card.  It would also work well on children's birthday cards.<br /><br />I used 80 lb. card stock to cut this die on my Sizzix Grand Calibur machine,<br /><br />Please see customer image for an example of an A7 (5&#34; x 7&#34;) anniversary card that I made with this die.  The castle die is made by Quick Kutz and the cat tails are cut from another Cottage Cutz die, &#34;Mallard Ducks w/ Cats-tail.&#34;"
1,Great wallet case. Nice n simple
1,"I really like my new case it's durable, comfortable to hold, and I like the stands!!!"
1,"If you're in doubt to purchase this, don't be! Order it!  I had my iPhone 6+ mounted on my motorcycle - it happened to pop out of the holder it was in, while I was moving.  I guess it was the vibration.  Irregardless, it landed on concrete in the middle of a busy intersection. After turning around to go retrieve it, I watched it being driven over by 4 cars.  There is not one scratch on my phone.  The screen did not break/crack.  I was so relieved when I got it back - words cannot describe."
1,"Was just what my husband needed, he just broke the screen on his phone so this is a life saver."
-1,Ordered 2 of these. Both Stylist are bent
1,Love this! I Have been using this holder for my IPhone 6 while riding my bike for the past 2 months or so. I ride on paved streets and crushed gravel bike paths and it works great..my phone stays in place solidly and is easy to use. I definitely recommend this product!
1,"i bought this charger for note 4, i am fully satisfied with this charger, its same like original one which one come with the phone, charge so fast like original one, and phone show that on screen its adaptive fast charger, nothing difference then original one. highly recommended."
1,Love this. I must have broken a million apple chargers. I've had this for months now and it hasn't broken.I love the length. I need to buy another one for my car!
1,"These headphones really deliver! Being on the go all the time, having a durable, lightweight, and wireless headset was very high on my priority list. After doing some research, and reading the many positive reviews, I decided to try these Blimark Bluetooth earbuds, and I was very happy with my decision!<br /><br />After receiving them promptly, I was immediately impressed by the overall quality of the packaging and materials, and the sound was extremely impressive as well. Even though the bass is a bit subtle and perhaps not as deep as some over the ear or higher quality headsets, these earbuds still create the perfect undertones to those hot and heavy dance beats!<br /><br />They are excellent at noise cancellation as well, allowing the music to be super focused with the perfect level of sound. The comfortable fit allows them to fit snug and very close to your ear, making them great for working out, running, or even dancing. I have been using them for several weeks now, and I can honestly say that I will not be using any other kind for quite some time! If you’re looking to purchase a pair of great wireless headphones without breaking the bank, this is the set to get!"
1,I like this case. I was looking for a case that was not bulky and i could easily grip. With this case i can get to the phone unlock it with my fingerprint and scroll better. I found that it fits really good in my hand when im using it. the rubber is not thick and all around fits nicely on my phone. One of the good parts of getting this case it came with a  screen protector. Fits goods and didn't take away from the sensitivity. I love the color it is just as pictured.
1,I am very pleased with my order it was more than I expected and fast delivery!!!
1,"Device holder is awesome, holds my phone securely with no shaking.  Thanks a lot guys.  Great product :)"
1,Great product fast shipping
-1,Clip was very loose on the phone
0,Serves the purpose but a little short
0,The charger holds its grip to the watch and does its job so far. The problem is that it is indeed a charger only. If you want to connect it to the computer via USB it doesn't work at all. I suppose that it provides only power connections and the data pins are not connected at all. The computer doesn't recognize it when plugged in although the watch is charged properly. If you are an Android Wear developer and need this to connect to the computer then this is definitely not your cradle.
1,Quality and performance is tip top. Keep striving for better Anker!
-1,"is only for 5 months,I brought in march and not work."
1,No one ever takes my picture.  All pics I have are of everyone else in the family.  Not any longer.  It's really easy to use.  A little tight on my iPhone6S because it has a protective cover on it and makes the phone absolutely as large as the prongs will spread.  Works like a charm.
1,"My mom made me purchase this for my hike on the Appalachian Trail. It worked great the first two weeks until I changed the batteries. After that, it quit sending the automatic updates to the website. It would turn off until manually turned back on. Needless to say my family and friends thought I was dead quite a few times.<br /><br />I'm sure it's all my fault and I bought the wrong batteries or something but was still a big pain in the butt. I haven't messed with it since returning."
1,Love it
1,good
1,Perfect black minimalistic TPU case for S5.
-1,"I bought one. It worked. I bought a second one for another vehicle. It didn't work, so I switched the two. I used the second one and it caught on fire. I burned my hand. Luckily, me and my kids are okay, and so is the. Vehicle and $900 phone. The original one fell apart the same day as the fire. Don't waste your money!!!"
1,I love this case for my new 5c.  It fits the phone perfectly and is snuggly.  I also love the color and how it is also transparent so that you can see the green of my phone on the back.  This is not a bulky case and fits nicely in purses that have pre-sized pouches for cell phones. I highly recommend this case.
1,This case is perfect for my Kindle Fire and costs a lot less than some of the other ones.
-1,"The Worst !  Range and clarity sucks. this my second one , no better then the first"
1,I think this is actually a perfect gift for a teenager. You have many colors to choose from. This is the smallest selfie stick I have ever seen. Its small enough to fit in my clutches. I already used it with my husbands Galaxy S5 while his case was on. I was able to use it right away the only thing I had to do is connect the take line to the phone jack and I was ready to start taking pics. I believe in some phones you will have download an app. I was actually shocked that a small pen sized selfie stick could expand that long.<br />*I received this product for a discount price in exchange for an honest unbiased review.
0,"Nice quality but no flap magnet or closure lock, was worried if phone fell display could be damaged"
1,Haven't had the back up camera part installed yet but it works great as a mirror
-1,Don't stick correctly
1,Works so much like my jiake phone I just love it.the price was great. Best priced product for the specs and promotional offers
1,Like
1,"I love the design! It's sleek and functional, and my Note 4 fits perfectly. The only flaw is that the exterior looked &#34;dirty&#34;. There was no shine or sheen to the patent-leather look. It had many streaks and looked &#34;cloudy&#34;. I returned it and received a replacement, which looked the same. I used different  cleaning products, but the only thing that worked was rubbing alcohol. It looks beautiful now."
1,Worked perfectly!
1,Product exactly as described at a reasonable price and prompt delivery. Couldn't as for more.
1,"This has been fantanstic.  It quick charges my phone (an i6) which has been REALLY useful when out for a long day.<br /><br />Down sides:  Takes a long time to charge, and is a little heavy to carry around -- but I usually leave one in the car.<br /><br />For the great price, I bought 2, so the long charge time doesn't cause a problem.  When one is charged, I put it in my car and plug in the second."
1,Like these snug gloves.
-1,The battery lasted 8 days.  After the 8th day started getting the message &#34;Invalid Battery&#34;
-1,"Very poor quality.  No matter what I do, people can't hear me when I'm using it.  In some cases, it doesn't even speak correct English."
1,I have several of these and I love how strong they are.
1,"Very good<br />Only problem is plastic screen scratches kind of<br />easily, but not a big deal.  Dropped phone several times with no damage.  Nice looking case."
-1,I followed instructions on the internet (it took me two hours) and the battery broke the iphone.  I had to buy a new phone because of it:(
1,It works as advertised.
0,"I have an Iphone 6 Plus, and when I put my phone in it it snapped back and actually cracked my Zag glass screen protector, I hope my actual phone is not cracked, I have not taken my screen protector off yet! The stick itself works great, but this now might cost me a couple hundred dollars."
1,It's so cute & came way earlier then any of my other cases & I ordered them 2-3 weeks before .<br />I had the pink one before the purple one . I think the pink one actually looks better I just can't seem to find it .<br />& it doesn't stink or nothing . YES !!
0,"6 months,no problems yet; except foe the fact that it doesnt read mini sd cards, being thats the reason i bought it"
1,Goes on very easily and stays in place. So far it saved my screen from a really nasty damage so i can safely say that this product can withstand cosmetic stuff due to regular wear.
0,"As others have indicated, the black jelly case is very glossy. It doesn't look like the picture and scuffs easily. Buttons take some effort to push, and I frequently have to hold both sides to squeeze the power button (sometimes accidentally taking screen shots!). But it does make the phone much more tacky and easy to hold. It fits well and ports are easily accessible."
0,Just received it and holds phone good but I ordered purple and its very pink.
1,Very good for tablets and phones.
1,"Top port stopped working after 45 days. Too late to return.<br /><br />Review update: Anker support reached out and offered trouble-shooting solutions. P.S. I like the upgrade of this model better than the 24W 2-port usb wall charger.  If you are debating, get the 24w!"
1,Very pleased with this arm band. Does what I need it to and fits perfectly. I would recommend the arm band extender for those with average to larger sized arms.
1,"For the potential buyers that have a Samsung Galaxy 3:<br /><br />To me it feels pretty much the same. Not much of a difference except for a few.<br />The most noticeable is the appearance, of course. It is much larger and was a bit of a challenge for me since I have small hands, but you get used to it pretty quickly. The &#34;back&#34; button is placed on the left side rather on the right.<br />The Wifi connection gave me some problems, but after fumbling around a bit I was finally able to connect to further wifi hotspots rather than in my own home (this is especially important for gps/locations).<br />The call quality is pretty much the same depending on your wifi. Speakers are BEAUTIFUL on this thing! The Galaxy was loud, but this has quite a range and quality.<br />I thought the screen resolution would be a downgrade and I thought it would look &#34;fake&#34;, but I was surprised at how clear everything was. (Tsum Tsum is so much more fun to play on here!!!).<br /><br />The most important change is the storage space. This phone provides 8gb, but when you check it it will say that you have already used up to 6gb of the space. The majority of it is coming from your preloaded apps. Useless, useless apps!!<br />After some research I bought a 32gb micro sd card along with it. When you set up this phone I would disable any preloaded apps that you don't need at all (you can't delete any of them...). For any new apps that you downloaded for yourself you have the option to place it in the sd card instead of your phone storage to save space. I have about 13 apps on the side that go to the sd card and I still have 2gb space left on the phone storage, which is a good sign leaving me with 28gb of space on the sd card!<br />Keep in mind that only some apps can be transferred to the sd card.<br />Another side note is that you cannot take the back of the phone off so you can't change the battery. However, on a full day of leaving wifi conn. on and using tumblr and facebook formore than an hour (and some tsum tsum) thoughout the day only leaves me at around 60-70%<br /><br />Camera quality is alright. The thing with this is that it can be either as good as the galaxy 3 or worse. It really depends on your steady hands and how steady your object of focus is. I am fine with this camera and is the only reason why I got this phone at this price, but the quality is a downgrade for sure. It's fine in the daylight and if you have some sort of tripod, but anytime that is dark even the flash won't help that grainy look you get on cheaper phones unless you have a GOOD light source.<br /><br />This phone likes to update a lot (twice a month at this rate), but that could just be either my phone is adjusting itself or I have bad luck.<br /><br />Either way, for this price I would give this phone a 7/10 mostly because of the camera quality. Everything else is fine if you are okay with some minor changes and routines."
1,Was as advertised
-1,It broke after only one week
1,Very happy with his product
-1,Horrible. Scr
1,Good thing it has 2 ports. There's always someone else in my car. Its good material. Charges my phone perfectly fine. No complaints. I recommend this product.
0,Works but I have larger arms on top and it is tight
1,"I received this so that I could use it and review it.  and give my unbiased opinion. First I want to say It was way easier to put on than i thought. it passed the test if me trying to scratch it with my keys. It even witheld the face down drop from about 3 feet. this is a quality screen protector,"
1,They are pretty legit. Charge just fine. I don't know why but i thought they were metal. heh.
1,"This case is attractive, the color is true to what I ordered, and it fits as described.  The only complaint is that it is a bit thick and bulky.  Not terribly so, but thicker than I'd have liked. Overall, a very good case and protection."
1,Took a while to come but works just fine
1,"Really good case!  Dropped my 5S several times, and not a single scratch!  Looks nice and sleek too, being all black."
-1,It takes forever to charge and it gets hot.
0,The video quality wasn't what I expected but it works well enough.
0,"One tool was slightly bent, the battery was OK at best as far as performance."
1,Thank you
-1,"Does not fit my phone, they did not specify that it would not fit active..."
1,This is what it says..... waterproof but NOTE:....IT DOES NOT FLOAT.  If you are looking for a floating case you need to look further.  I was not thinking about that and guess I assumed that it would float.  I cannot hold that against the product as it does not make any claims as such.  It is what it says and the price it right. Good product.
1,Works perfectly!
1,Pouch works exactly as described. Very satisfied with purchase!
1,"[[ASIN:B00QTE09SY iClever® 4.8A 24W Dual USB Travel Wall Charger with SmartID Technology, Foldable Plug for iPhone iPad, Samsung Galaxy, HTC Nexus Moto Blackberry, Bluetooth Speaker Headset, Power Bank and More, White]]  Great product that solves a simple problem and ends the race between my wife and I for the charger outlet.  No worry that we have different devices and this thing knows what you need and handles the job.  Quality seems excellent."
1,Few weeks now and still working great
0,"It works pretty good for the price, the button is a little sensitive when changing settings,other than that very happy with purchase<br />i"
1,"This thing is awesome! Its small and quickly charges my phone and tablet. I bought it when it went on sale for 10$, which is a great price to pay for this product. This product doesn't come with a wall charger but it comes with a USB to micro USB. Since I had an old wall charger from a phone, I was able to use that. If you have a Samsung Galaxy, the USB charging cord that comes with it can be used to charge your phone. The cord that comes with it is not super long, which I like while charging my phone because it doesn't get in the way.<br /><br />Pros: Small, charges quickly, holds good charge easy to use, indication of external battery charge with LED<br /><br />Cons: Sometimes if its charging something for a while it gets hot, doesn't come with a wall charger (wasn't a big deal to me)"
1,"Like the case. It's comfortable in the hand, the buttons work well, and most importantly the phone feels protected. It's not the most aesthetically pleasing case... Wish UAG wasn't stamped so prominently on the back"
1,"I love, love love this cell phone clutch.  I have 3 different ones and this one is by far the prettiest.  Good quality.  Well worth it."
1,excellent
0,It chipped after 30 days of use when my daughter dropped it but the phone is still good.
0,got wet once and stoped working
1,Great cable. Gets the job done.
0,Good
-1,[[ASIN:B00DZSGS8W BLU Q170T Samba TV Unlocked Dual SIM Quad-Band GSM Phone (White/blue)]] this gatge this device vin with deserts programming details which do not allow me to save messages or contacts or because at times restarts alone and makes me lose the information stored with the understanding that they sent a malfunctioning phone.
1,It sounds awesome so happy with my speakers
1,No review
-1,Charges phone but not constantly. Often have To check make sure its charging device.  Its not all that
1,"Awesome phone case, doesn't make the phone look big, the design is great and the buttons are great to the touch."
-1,Mine is going straight back.  Couldn't get it to turn on or take a charge fresh out of the box.  Don't waste your money.
1,"Works great, nice price."
-1,Charged great when it worked. Did not even last half a year.
1,works as expected.  no Wow factor to earn a fifth star but I am very pleased with the performance.  I also like that it comes with a double sided velcro tape to post to a wall or desk
1,"My wife loves it, but it didn't work well for my car"
1,Quality product!
1,"Love it. Easy to apply and i didn't face any problems with it. I loved the it came with it tow small wipes to clean your screen before apply it, one is dry and one is wit."
1,"I ordered this case as a gift for my niece and she loves it, she said it made her phone look very classy and the stylus was an extra bonus that she enjoys.  However, I also ordered the glass screen protector which did not fit the phone, so I will be returning it."
1,"This is a great price for a great case. It's exactly what I wanted, fits my Moto X perfectly and protects it great. I don't really drop my phone, but it seems pretty sturdy for those who do."
1,Best case ever. I get so many compliments on it!
1,Great seller. Fast delivery. Product as described. Thank you!
1,EZ to use
1,"Excellent product, fast shipping!!!"
1,"Works as expected. I wish that I could get to the photo button though,"
1,"The case met my expectations. The corners are more of a soft rubber with a hard back. It is two pieces, easy to put on. It does add a little bulk to an already good sized phone, but I like it, I feel like my investment is protected. It arrived fast, good service."
1,works looks great looks good
1,"Good hardy case.  Not stylish, but gets the job done."
-1,"Sound great.<br />Bluetooth connection can sometimes be problematic.<br />Charging connector is terrible, so whether or not it will charge when you plug it in is a roll of the dice.<br />Without power, these are pretty much worthless."
1,The glass was not a perfect fit but it has protected my phone nicely. I would suggest watching videos on how to install.
1,Great phone
1,"It fits my S5 mini phone but not perfectly, especially on the bottom, it doesn't attach very well"
1,Exactly as advertised
0,It serves it's purpose but it is loud for whoever is sitting in the seat where it is attached to.
-1,charges very slow
1,"These cables seem to be very well made and I believe durability will not be a problem.  I have a Galaxy S6 and these cables work great with it,  they have a very rapid rate of charge and they stay plugged into my phone securely.  I also love the color coding because now I can give them to my kids and they no longer argue over which cable belongs to which child.  Another positive is the variety of cable lengths in the package.  The 3 ft. cables work great in the car and the longer ones are perfect for the house.  The price is unbelievable for the quality you receive and so far I have no complaints about these cables."
1,I LOVE IT. IT WORKS GREAT AND I REALLY LOVE THAT IT TURNS OFF WHEN THE CHARGE IS COMPLETE.
1,Great case at an affordable price
1,Nice small car charger. Charges pretty fast. not much more to say about it. it is what it is.
1,Fits as it should
0,"I bought them in April and they just stop functioning the other day (August).  If that had not happened I would have given it 4-5 stars.  The only other reason not 5 stars was, the &#34;on&#34; switch did not connect the device reliably.  I had to repeatedly switch it &#34;off&#34; & &#34;on&#34; about 4 times, every time, to get it to connect.  I love the headphones, but I guess they don't work, so no good."
1,"I owned many headphones and earbuds cheap and expensive, these earbuds for some reason stand out as the best earbuds I have ever owned. I bought 5 at once so I have them for a long time. It fits the ear well, also comes with two other replacement smaller and larger.  I used them initially with blackberry and that's how I got the fist pair, but then they worked excellent with my iPhones since I made the switch few years ago. Mine started falling apart because they were the only earbuds I can use reliably. Very good quality and delivers excellent sound as well as excellent clarity and reliability to use with the phone. Compared to much more expensive earbuds, these are &#34;Highly&#34; recommended."
1,Works great. Good fit.
-1,Didn't stick to my smooth plastic dash like advertised. Might stick to windshield but that's not why I bought it. Very dissatisfied.
-1,It did not work and we tried to make it work.
1,"Solid product. I have a few different Anker cables, and none have let me down so far. The smaller form factor allowed this to work with my wifes Defender case which was a challenge for many cables."
1,It works as advertised.
1,"Great USB Hub! Small, sleek and perfect. Had no issues hooking it up. The two smart power ports charge devices through USB quick and fast."
1,Perfect for my 02 escape
1,"Case fits snug, but is still flexible and easy to hold."
1,Perfect
1,I like the case. It fit perfectly and it's very sturdy. It took too long to get here.
1,good phone for my elderly mom.  keyboard key
1,"Just what I needed! Sometimes I want a low shot, and my tripos doesn't reach the ground. This is PERFECT for that!:) I would definitely buy it again!"
-1,"The absolute first time the phone was dropped while using this case, the screen cracked. I would not recommend this case to someone. The phone fell maybe 3 feet onto the floor, it fell flat, screenside down, and the whole screen cracked. The case also feels very cheeply made, the rubber that covers where the s pen is and the charging port is very flimsy and it feels as if you could easily rip it off. This case does not offer appropriate protection."
1,I was very schocked when I received this and in a good way . the product looked new and I purchased it for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it .
-1,The only reason I gave it an extra star instead of 1 star is because of the price. You get what you pay for. The sound quality is the worst I have ever herd on a pair of head phones. They wouldn't stay in my ears and there was no different sized buds that came with them. I mainly was just buying these with low expectations. I wanted to try a cheap pair of blue tooth buds before I went and spent money on a better pair. So I tried these and I liked the idea and how it worked but these were just too low quality for me. So i have recently spend more money on a higher quality pair and i love them. Maybe ill give these to someone who are curious also before they go spending money on an expensive pair.
1,This is simply the best selfie stick that I have ever had. All the other previous three failed my expectation. This one has exceeded my expectation with handy design and reliable blue tooth connections.
1,Very cute graphics.
1,It's very thin.. not a life proof case by any means. but I love the gold pineapples. I get a lot of compliments on it.
1,"I just bought a new battery for my Samsung S5 and then the old battery just died on me.. So, now that was no longer my back up, but my full time battery. I noticed my phone dying half way through the day, and didn't think I would stay with Samsung. (I don't like that you can't change out the battery anymore, or add SD card) So I didn't want to buy something only compatible with Samsung. So I purchased this so I can use it with any of my electronics in need of a charge. It works great, and is pretty fast."
1,My favorite headphones! These earbuds have amazing high and low end and the range of the Bluetooth connection is impressive for their price.
-1,Very diappointing. The case is very loose and doesn't stay on the phone.
-1,It won't stay charged for more than 4 hours even if I'm not texting or talking on it.  Every day by noon it is dead
1,"Its a fantastic gadget for the car. It is very easy to install and operate. The quality of the product is good. The markings in green, yellow and red while reversing really helps. It does not show the distance though but you will get used to it and develop judgement. The camera  is not freely rotating and needs to be set and fixed tight with the screws provided. Once you connect the power supply from the reverse tail light the camera and monitor (needs to be connected to 12V socket- cigarette lighter) switches on immediately very negligible delay. Overall a value for money gadget."
1,thank you
1,"[[VIDEOID:f2ef858c1586762c334e2029ea27bda3]]I really like this camera an I'm glad I purchased it. With it I can easily record my trips without having to worry about fiddling with buttons. It's probably smaller than you think and isn't easy to spot as long as you don't put it in the middle of the windshield.  It comes with everything you need to put it in your car, including an 8gb micro sd card, a cig lighter adapter, sticky cable holders and two sided tape to stick it to the windshield. Tip: Make sure you choose a location and test it before affixing it to the windshield. There are extras of two sided tape included, but it's a pain to get back off the windshield once it is on there.  The mount is good, but it could be better. It's easy enough to take the camera off of the mount, but if you wanted to put the camera in a different car you'd have to take the two sided tape off of your windshield and the mount and put on a new piece. That's fine though, since I don't plan on using it in another car.  The camera comes with the latest version of the software as of this writing. The manual directs you to mini0806.com, which has one newer update available (5/2015), but when asking SplashETech about this, they said this is the manufacturer site and that updates would be posted to the splashetech.net site, which apparently is no longer their site since the last time I visited it. I have no idea what happened with that, but it looks like the current site is advertising furniture.  The video looks good. I was only able to clearly make out license plates on the highest setting though. The GPS is a nice feature. You can set it to display the speed and coordinates on the video itself along with the date and time. When the sun is at the right angle there is a bit of glare off of the dashboard that is apparently solved with a CPL filter. I see that this is included with some other units. I kind of wish it was included with this instead of the 8gb card, since I probably will not beusing the 8gb card.  At night you can see things, but it's certainly not &#34;night vision&#34; in any sense.  One problem I found is the slot a and slot b functionality doesn't work as intended. From what I gather it's supposed to roll over to the next slot when one card is full. It does not do this though. It'll just remove the oldest files on one card when it is full. If one card is removed, it'll record to the other card. For my purposes a 32gb card is enough for 4.5 hours of video on the second largest video setting, and I really don't need to save more video than that.  Another issue is the manual mentions a &#34;parking guard mount&#34; but it simply isn't available, so there is no true parking mode. You could hard wire into an unswitched power source and just leave the camera on all the time, but that's not really an efficient solution. The option in the menu is supposed to activate recording when a vibration is felt by the camera, but it doesn't look like it works without the mount.  Overall it's a great unit and I would recommend this to a friend. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  To recap -  Pros:  - Very small, and sleek  - Good video quality on the highest setting  - Firmware seems to be updated regularly (at least on mini0806.com)  - Comes with everything you need  Cons:  - The mount could be better  - Slot A & B functionality doesn't work properly (doesn't start recording to other card when one is full)  - Needs the CPL filter to prevent glare  - No parking mode  Edit: added video of a close call I had. The quality is significantly reduced by Amazon. In the full resolution video I can see the car's license plate."
-1,This was my first lifeproof and I'll just say I was beyond excited when it was first purchased. To say that this case didn't live up to my expectations would be a huge understatement. I bought the case from Amazon and within the first month or two the mute (sound) button had torn significantly lowering the value of the case and stripping it of it's waterproof seal. I spoke with LifeProof's customer service and was sent a new phone case fairly quickly (which surprised and delighted me). Unfortunately about a month or two after receiving the replacement case it also began to breakdown (althought not as badly in the same spot) but also along the door for the charging cable (it has a hole also). These cases definitely were not worth their price and also not what I expected from a company that I heard so much positive praise about. I can't say that I'd buy again.
1,Went kayaking down river and case worked perfectly. I have iphone 6 plus and it fits perfectly. I did the water test before I put my phone in it. Did not take any pictures underwater but it did it did get in water with it around my neck and no problems with water coming in. Very good for me!
1,"The Defender Case is a typical OtterBox case that is heavy-duty and durable.  This product is thick and clunky.  I think of it more for a construction worker or similar field.  I like that it has a built in screen protector that does not have to be purchased separately.  The name fits the case.  This case also comes with a durable clip to use on the outside of your clothing or clipped into a bag.  The only real “negative” is the price. . . when it’s Made in China for a few bucks. . . it’s hard to justify the current price.  On the other hand, if you want a case with this kind of protection, it’s a great case."
1,Absolutely love this case. The finish on the back is nice a smooth but the edges give it good grip. I love that the design is not on the outer layer on the back so it does not scratch off. Low profile but sticks out enough to protect the screen and wraps completely around bottom rather than leaving it exposed as others do.
-1,"This is my second one in the past maybe 3-4 years, and after about a year or so they always stop working. They work awesome at first and sound great. Just wish it would last longer."
0,"For the most part everything is great for me, but my biggest problem is the battery. I could 1 minute be at 100% then 2 minutes later be at 81 & it could be great one day & awful the next."
1,looks great.
1,Excellent Case
-1,It doesn't last more than 2 weeks. The exact time that i can't return it.  This is my fifth and last.
1,"good, battery life great, software strong, speakers great"
-1,Since I had to return the phone it didn't work now I have a screen protector that I can't use.. I have to pay the postage to get all my money back..hassle..
-1,I had used this once. I plugged it in to use it a second time and i immediately smelled burning and saw smoke. The end that plugs into the phone was smoking and burning. Smoke immediately filled my car. Had I not been in my driveway this could have been very dangerous. And I've now tried the charger base with other cords and it wont work with any other cord. Needless to say I would never buy another one!!!!
1,"I use this most everyday on my bicycle.  I get to rock to my iTunes, check weather, or use it for turn-by-turn navigation through the streets of downtown Portland Oregon."
1,great buy
1,Working great !
1,The cap fitted perfect. The unique difference is that the original was wite and this one is black; it doesn't affect anything under the hood.
-1,The cord still works but I can see it cracks on the cord from where the cord would finally give up and stop working. I expected amazon to make better products. I have had this for a little more than 4 months.<br />Amazon Please let me know if I can return or get a replacement. Thanks.
1,I had no problems putting the screen protector on my phone.  I like the durability of the tempered glass.
0,Glue on the velcro won't stick when hot.
1,"Love it, it is good for when I am walking do not have to hold my phone in my hand."
1,"If you have no use for the dual point connectivity, DEFINITELY go with the cheaper model of the same brand! (Kinivo BTC450).<br /><br />The multipoint connectivity of this 455 model allows you to connect two Bluetooth devices concurrently. But it comes with some pretty major trade-offs. For one, for the first 30 seconds after turning on your car and playing music (through your phone for instance) the Kinivo is actively searching for a second device... and for those 30 seconds it fades in and out of your signal. So incredibly annoying!<br /><br />The second side effect is that it gets super confusing when a second device is synced simultaneously anyways. It's gotten so frustrating with my wife in the car with her iPhone paired as well. We have no idea what the Bluetooth is doing, cause sometimes my phone works, and other times hers does. Random. I reset the Kinivo and now I am the only paired device.<br /><br />I do like having a Bluetooth-enabled vehicle now, and everything else about the Kinivo I'm a fan of.<br /><br />One last thing is that if you encounter interference using this you may need what's called a Ground Loop Isolator. I purchased this one (https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001EAQTRI) and all my interference went away."
-1,The is perfect for its big button for my father with macular degeneration<br /> Also not a complicated phone<br /> Had to get a different SIM card for it to work for ATT.<br />The signal goes from 2 bars to no service constantly and this is without moving. My parents would call someone and it would ring on the callers end but phone would lose signal at some point in ringing And my parents would have to keep trying. The call receiver would pick up phone but my parents weren't there since the phone not lose a signal
1,"Great case, hard to open slot where you connect to charge."
1,Great price<br />Great Quality
1,Perfect !
1,Nice phone.  It does all I need.
1,Nice very nice
0,Not what I expected... There is no screen cover so I will have to get a sepRate one to protect the screen
1,Pretty case but doesn't fully fit my phone. It still works.
1,"Fast delivery, works perfect"
1,Love the prodcut
1,Great! Love it!
1,"Best money spent. After 2 1/2 years I've had this device. To this day I still say it's best money spent. In time the wear and tear will take its toll. Esspecially if you're like me. I wear it when running, in the gym, or if I take public transportation. I like to hear music in one ear and still be aware of my surroundings.  Be it a person or a vehicle but I'm crossing the street. You may have to replace the rubber band that lies beneath the latex ear bud. If it pops in time. My advice is to order a single pack off of this site. I was so pleased I could just order a new pack of ear buds from Amazon for under $10."
0,Has too many air bubbles.  Unable to get a clear screen.
-1,"WHAT A PIECE OF CHEAPJUNK!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL FUNCTION FOR LONGER THAN 6 WEEKS!<br />THE MICRO USB CONNECTOR ON THE POWERBOT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CHEAPEST OF IT'S TYPE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE OWNED A VARIETY OF DEVICES WITH MIRCO USB PORTS!!!  IT STARTED AFTER ABOUT 5 WEEKS OF USAGE. AT FIRST, THE PORT JUST NEEDED A LITTLE BIT OF JIGGLING TO GET IT TO WORK. AS TIME PROGRESSED, ABOUT 3 WEEKS, THE CHARGING PORT CONNECTION JUST STOPPED FUNCTIONING. NOTE: SINCE I OWN A SAMSUNG GALAXY S3, WHICH IS RENOWNED FOR IT'S HIGH MICRO USB CHARGING PORT FAILURE, AND THE REASON WHY I BOUGHT THIS POWERBOT IN THE FIRST PLACE, I KNEW THAT THE BEST METHOD FOR PREVENTING MICRO USB WEAR WAS TO LEAVE THE MICRO END OF THE CABLE PLUGGED IN TO THE POWERBOT, AND UNPLUG THE STANDARD USB CONNECTOR FROM THE CHARGER WHEN NOT IN USE. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DID NOT WORK!  EVEN WITH MY EXPERIENCE WITH PREVIOUS MICRO USB PORT FAILURES, I WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN EVADING THIS ISSUE.  PLEASE CHOOSE ANOTHER BRAND THAT HAS A HARDWIRED CABLE AND SKIP ONES WITH A MICRO USB PORT. I ORDERED ONE THE OTHER DAY. IT HAS A STANDARD SIZE USB CABLE COMING OUT OF THE CHARGING UNIT. SO, I WILL LEAVE THAT PLUGGED INTO THE CHARGER AND JUST UNPLUG THE 110 VOLT CHARGER FROM OUTLET. (THIS METHOD ALSO WORKS WITH 12 v CAR CHARGERS) THIS WAY, I WON'T HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT EXCESSIVE WEAR, AS WELL, ON THE STANDARD USB CONNECTOR."
1,Great buy. Works as described.
0,It fits pretty good. It is very clear and is very easy to install. Only issue is the edges don't stick down. There is a border all the way around that seems to be trapping dust.
1,"Best car charger I have ever used! One of the only chargers I've actually had charge my devices consisistantly. I use a lot of phablet style phones such as the Galaxy Note Series and the One Plus One so these are some power hungry phones, other car chargers just cause these devices to discharge slower or keep a charge while this charger actually provides a real charge to my devices."
0,Nice packaging but it leaves my screen grainy...
1,Works great and cheaper than the box stores.
1,These are amazing. I love everything about them.
1,Great Product
1,Good product.
1,"Overall I like this case. It keeps my phone safe from drops, but the bottom part of the case keeps falling off. It would be nice if there were a way for the two parts of the case to snap or click together to prevent this."
1,Just as expected. Get a lot more time out of my phone now!
1,Works great love it very much!
1,Great ear phones! Works well.
-1,It was an excellent charger until both USB ports came apart and are so loose it won't hold a USB plug to even charge. I might take it apart to see what's wrong since my return period is over. I popped the case open to find 18650 batteries inside. I only did one corner but judging the size of say there's maybe 6-8 of the puppies in there. It may not work at a phone charger anymore but hey. Free flashlight batteries. I'll keep updating this till I fix it or junk it. UPDATE: I have taken it apart to find 8 18650 batteries. I also found why it wasn't charging. Weak soldering that broke and only connected when I held it a certain way that connected the USB port to the mother board. I will update when I get home again and try to resolder the ports.
1,Works well with 4th generation iPad!
1,I've used their screen protectors before but is is my first experience with the glass screen protector. It fits nicely and was so easy to install.  No bubbles of course!
1,Cords work great have no complaints.
1,This phone mount is clean and looks like it belongs in the car. Not some ugly piece of plastic that serve no purpose. My only complaint is the suction cup. The mount tends to fall from the windshield often. This is can be frustrating when you're using your GPS
1,Works for its intended purpose.
-1,Not at all what I wanted. The quality but less than desired.
1,"This would be probably my fourth Anker product and there is a reason for it. The charger is at par with latest smartphone chargers. I own a OnePlus One and did a charge test. There is absolutely no noticeable difference between as far as charge time is concerned. Tested the ampere rating with app as well, they both perform quite similar. Bought it off a sale day at $8 bucks.  Pros: - Super quick charging i.e. Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 with 2A output - 3ft long powerful cable included which is ideal for most uses - Sub $10 price point"
1,I have the S5 apparently bought the wrong case =(
-1,"These come pre-impreganated with dust. Once installed, the cover shimmers rainbow colors. I opted to leave my screen unprotected rather than use these. If these were condoms, then I'd have dozens of children by now."
1,Protects your screen from scratches while giving it that smooth glass feeling. I'll never go back to plastic screen protectors.
1,Great quality. Very easy to install.
1,"Charges 2 5s's at the same time easily. Nice and low profile, was a lot smaller than most others I saw in the store."
1,Fit perfectly
1,These are the best! Super sturdy and truly waterproof. Tons better than my current case.
1,It works. Period.
-1,"I am amazed. This cord is perfect. First, the length. I am able to use my device in bed, use it on the couch in any comfortable position, and best of all charge my device without any faulty wiring.   The cord (10 ft) I bought is beautiful. It is nearly identical to the shipped 30-pin cords that come with iDevices. The connection from the charging end to the port on my device is firm and fixated yet not so much that its a struggle to unplug. Storage is nice because the cord coils up into a nice circle, making a comfortable width of about a soda can.  The best part of this buy is that the price was around ten dollars (including shipping). TEN DOLLARS. The quality of this accessory is so akin to the stock cords that I can hardly believe it. I will absolutely be buying more.  UPDATE: It's been about one month. The cord has ceased to charge my device. I had to buy yet another 30-pin cord. I'm asking for a refund."
1,Nice value. Protects the screen well. Delivered quickly.
1,"Works nicely with the 15000mAh version and keeps it clean and protected. The case is a little bit longer which works out well as you can plug in the cable and zip it up with only the wire poking out. The mesh pocket is handy to hold the USB cables and user's manual. The zipper could be beefier, but then again, I haven't had any problems with it yet."
1,Nice will work just fine!
1,Thx
1,"I'm so satisfied with this product. When my screen protector was damaged, I emailed them and they sent a new one within a few days. So glad I ordered this product."
1,working perfect
0,"The case I purchased was the &#34;Hakuna Matata&#34; saying one. I also have the same problem with the charging area not being able to fit the plug. Overall the skin is pretty durable protection (not if you drop it of course). But protects from scratches. It does leave the bottom open for dust and dirt to get into the speaker holes, so clean often."
1,Not perfect but so good. Size is litter small to cover my phone but also can accept.
-1,Broke the 2nd day
1,I got promo code for leaving fair review. great deal!
1,"These are good quality; I like the Bluetooth capability. I like how they can be used wirh music and phone calls.  Sometimes, though, they do fall out of my ears. That causes an inconvenience. I would recommend these for use."
-1,does not pick up at all
-1,I had this for only a month and the charging port just broke off inside my phone when i was taking my phone out of it. It has to be a defective device and now I can't return it. I expected this device to last longer.
1,This is my review of the [[ASIN:B00KDLL3YS UNU Enerpak Micro Battery]]. I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. The packaging the product comes in is very simple and in the box you get a user guide and a 1 foot long micro-usb charging cable. The cable can also be used to sync your phone to your computer so that's a plus.<br /><br />Onto the build of the actual battery pack this thing is incredibly small and lightweight. I weighed it at only 2.3 oz! It measures only 3.5 inches long and 1.1 or .78 inches wide depending on which side your measuring. The battery has a plastic build which contributes to the lightweight design I guess. There is also can LED light to show if the battery is charged when charging it. So it's red when charging then changes to blue when fully charged. Now the specs say this has a 1 Amp input but in my testing it actually charged slower than that at about 0.7 Amps so charging took a little bit longer than other battery packs of this capacity at about 4 to 5 hours. The USB Port outputs at 1 Amp which did output 1 Amp when I tested it with my usb power monitor.<br /><br />One thing a lot of people don't realize is that portable batteries like these are never 100% efficient so you will never get the stated capacity. So you should always estimate you'll get about 70% of the total. Sometimes more or less depending on how efficient the battery is. I tested this battery using my PortaPow USB Power Monitor and using the battery to charge up my Nexus 5. I got a total of 1566 mAh which needs to be converted so the actual number is 2116 mAh. Since the stated capacity of this battery is 2800 mAh this gives us a 75% efficiency which is the average for these battery packs. Overall the Enerpak Micro Battery from Unu is a great product for you if you want the small and lightest battery if you can overlook the long charge times and that fact that you don't get different LED colors to show your charge level. Here is a link to my review on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIgL0_IFwB8ps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIgL0_IFwB8
1,Love it
1,"It came with the cover snapped off, but after I put it back together and plugged it in I loved it. It seemed to charge my phone quicker then my old one, and I love that I can charge my phone in one and my daughter's phone in the other. The red light lets you know without wondering that your phone or device is charging. I have charged not only my phone but my laptop as well as my tablet. It seems substantial and strong enough to stand up to my teenagers and all the electronics that &#34;must&#34; be charged while driving. I am glad I was able to have the chance to purchase this through the VIP review club, and would definitely buy again."
1,This phone is amazing
1,Very very very good quality and make the device looks much more premium.<br />It was just one issue that the package it was broken but the case it self it was ok
-1,The wiring on this product was defective
1,"Love it! This is a replacement for an older 7-8 year model that finally gave up. Works great with great distance detection, loud volume options and the GPS feature on alert tells you your current speed. The blue readout is great at night, but hard to see in bright sun unless it is on the Max setting. You cannot go wrong with this unit."
1,"The case is so beautiful,  it is stunning! It fits my Galaxy Note 4  very snug, perfect cutouts for all ports, absolutely gorgeous. I have a white Galaxy Note 4, so the case  looks exactly like in the picture....actually better. I think the picture does not do it justice. My phone looks better and more stylish with clear case and a little touch of fuschia. My girlfriend is so in love with this case, she wants one, too...I might order one as a gift for her, also clear and fuschia ( dark pink)  Update: I ordered another case for my friend and she is very happy with it. We both love our clear cases with just a hint of pink."
1,"I Bought the previous version of this product but don't see a difference between the two. Works great with Cricket, but there is a caution.<br /><br />It includes a nanoSIM, with adapters for microSIM and miniSIM. I didn't know the difference, but the phone I got had an icon on the box that said not to use adapters. I googled and found out that the problem isn't electrical, it is mechanical in that the contacts that connect to the SIM card can catch on the plastic seams of the adapter if the SIM is removed and bend or break.<br /><br />This problem isn't a concern for me since I have no intention of ever removing the SIM, but it could become an issue if I change carriers (or Cricket requires a SIM change for some reason).<br /><br />So, depending on your phone, and if you ever want to remove the SIM, this may be a problem. You can google how to remove a nanoSIM in an adapter safely, which essentially is to use a thin plastic sheet (like screen protector film) to slip in between the SIM and contacts before removing the adapter in order to protect the contacts. There are YouTube videos showing the method (example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv8fA8j_8oQ)."
-1,Does not charge your iPod while plugged in the car. Rendered it worthless for me.
0,"Nice watch, but apps are not that robust.  Good watch and great to see texts and calls on my wrist before pulling my phone out of my pocket, but most other apps I have tried and then removed from the watch.  A few gave errors and developers did not resolve."
-1,"Bought this product because my battery wasn't holding charge as long and was taking longer to charge. Was told this was a new, original battery. Did as instructed in letting the battery go totally out and recharge.  Within a couple of weeks it wasn't holding a charge very well and at one point it was taking all into the evening after work, while I was asleep and had to have it plugged in at work all day into the evening and was only charged at 59%.  Don't waste your time or money.  Did return it since it was covered under Amazon's return policy."
1,great
-1,"I love the design of this case, but that's about it. For one thing, it won't even stay on my phone, it keeps randomly popping out of place and it won't actually protect your phone at all, lots of the edges are still exposed."
1,"Exactly as described, thank you"
1,Very good cover. Protects my phone well
1,"I'm pleased with this phone case. I was using a Pelican case that I bought at ATT when I got my phone. This one feels high quality. It does not have a rubber or silicone band or outer casing, which gives it a sleeker design. It also feels lighter than my other case, but I don't think we sacrificed protection. I have dropped my phone with this case on, without issues.I only give 4 stars instead of 5 because the case makes the buttons a little hard to push. I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for a review, but the words are my own."
1,this is great everything
1,This was very pretty I love the BLING. It still lasts
1,"I've reviewing quite a few usb charging systems over the year and as far as pure speed this one topped them all. Since I have no quick charge 2.0 compatible devices I tested it on my OnePlus One smartphone and noticed an overall 10% increase of charge speeds over my usual high speed charger, and over 100% faster than a normal usb charger.<br /><br />Quick stats:<br />Turbo Charger from Iclever: 2000 mah<br />My speedy hootoo usb faster charger: 1900 mah<br />Normal usb charger: 1000 mah<br /><br />This is a personally recommended item."
-1,I would not recommend. Shattered on the first drop including my iPods screen.
0,"Good, with a major flaw - The watch tends to become disconnected from the dock regularly because the magnet is recessed into the stand. I've woken up a few times and had to charge it differently."
1,it worked real good
1,Love it so pretty as seen in picture but of course u are buying a plastic cover so not made for providing much damage control but it can handle a few drops if need be
1,"Purchased for a colleague, he seems to be getting on fine with it"
1,"I am well satisfied with the Mophie 2200.  Is it real or a knockoff?  It sure looks real to me.  The packaging, product, and instructions are first rate.  It was at half charge out of the box.  It seems to loose a little charge during the day.  You absolutely MUST use the provided cable.  The one that came with the phone is to light weight.  It has too much loss.  It will work even better with a higher amperage charger like the one from a tablet. The fully charged Mophie will only recharge my S3 to about 60% ( wonder if it might be old/new stock?).  Which is okay for my needs.  It fits my phone perfectly!  No removing the back of the phone or anything like that.  I added a screen protector to protect the screen.  Both seem to protect the phone somewhat.  I don't think it comes anywhere close to the protection that I gave up using the Otter Box Defender (which leaks dust and dirt like a screen door and lasts less than a year before the rubber deteriorates).  The LEDs, switches, and case cutouts perform perfectly.  The buttons are somewhat sensitive, like on the phone itself.  Takes some getting used to after having to mash the buttons on the Otter Box.  It solved two of my needs. 1. No need to carry a spare battery in my pocket.  2. Saves the wear and tear on my phone recharging jack which can be somewhat fragile.  I am totally happy with this purchase, especially at the price of less than $20.  Now if could only find the drop in charger for it.  How cool would that be?"
1,Works very well and easy to install.
-1,It is not galaxy s4 compatible due to the absence of the headset cutout
1,"Yes, this IS a two piece unit (although at first blush it appears to be one piece).  There is one problem, though, and that one of the pieces of plastic partially covers the sound level button and causes the telephone to act erratically.  So, take some wire snips and cut it off and you're good to go."
1,Damn good product. Works well with my 2014 Moto X.
1,Excellent purchase
0,"Here's the thing. These cases are gorgeous. I dropped my phone once and it wasn't the wood that got damaged but the plastic surrounding the edges of the phone! I love the cases so much and I get tons of compliments on them so I bought a new one. I havent broken it yet, but I know its just a matter of time."
1,Love it
1,Kind of bulky but it does fit on the phone well.
1,Love the sound and noise cancellation<br />I feel surrounded by the music without outside distractions. They are comfortableto wear for extended period of time and the folding portability is great.
1,These are my favorite earbuds. The sound quality is good. The earbuds fit nice and snugly and stay in place. They are even comfortable to wear while laying on my side in bed. The remote & mic make pause/play and answering calls very easy.
1,was great  doing the job  very happy
0,It was okey.
1,Very happy with this purchase. Thank You!
1,"I was skeptical at first, trusting my phone to these bags, but I'll be damned, it worked perfectly. So long as you set up a hardware button on your phone for snapping pictures, you can take underwater photos and videos all day long.<br /><br />Remember a few things if going in the ocean:<br />1. Open your camera/video app before entering the water (Capacitive screens do not work underwater)<br />2. Assign a hardware button to snap a picture/start recording<br />3. Put your phone in Airplane mode. You won't get any signal underwater anyway."
1,"It is a very protecting case and I would say it was almost worth it. But if you get it, make sure you are getting it for all of its features and not just because it's water proof. The head phone jack cover broke off very easily but was fixable with just a little bit of glue"
1,I really love this case it is made out of what looks like real wood but the only bummer is that it does crack easily the first time i dropped my phone it cracked which is really a bummer i only had it for 3 days!! I do have to say it is very protective because i dropped it down my stairs and i really thought it would crack but it didn't!!
1,Love having an extra battery
1,"Does its job. Nice looking, I like the stand. Can use the stand horizontal or vertical"
1,Great fit
1,My husband uses this almost daily. Loves it.
1,Was brand new and in perfect condition!
1,"It gets the job done, as described, great buy for a solid brand name detector, very basic, but hook up and go."
1,It took a long time to get it but once we did my son loves it.
1,There are great. Just what I wanted.
1,Good Price
-1,This should be rated zero stars. Worst electronics purchase I have made in years. This thing is absolutely terrible. I travel a lot for work in the car and in and out of noisy airports each week. The sound suppression not only suppressed background noise but my voice cut in and out. Tried different placements of the mic and found if I smashed it against my face you could understand me on the other end. To hear anyone when driving or in a noisy environment I had to smash the earpiece into my ear and hold it with my hand. Not at all practical or comfortable. I either received a very defective product or the fact this thing is on the market is damn near criminal. I threw it out the window while driving it was so frustrating to try and rely on as a business person trying to conduct business in our mobile world. Epic failure of a product.
1,💜💜💜this case is awesom ! I dropped my case at least 4 times and I had no damage to my phone!
-1,This is not what I wanted ! I wanted a glass protector and not a plastic one. I'm very disappointed.
1,"Cable does everything as intended. Only issue for me is the &#34;TA&#34; logo brushed off within a day of usage, so if you like the Tech Armor logo, I'm sorry."
1,Really cute. Not much protection to the phone but really pretty.
-1,"Constantly says out of range, even when the phone is right next to the headphones."
-1,not gud
1,"Delivery was fast, and devise works well, as described."
1,WOW!!!!  It really holds super strong!!!  Very helpful
1,Arrived on time and as described.
1,"Pretty good screen protector, has a tendency to smudge more often and leave more fingerprints than the actual screen does, but other than that, great product, especially for the price"
1,Works
-1,"This is a complete waste. I am the worst of the purchase list. The worst finish of the goods, quality is also not good.  you can see circle of the screen and bond between screen."
1,Worx.
1,"Took me 30 seconds to install on my cell phone, so easy"
1,Great cable! It's the perfect size and makes everything sound great! Thank you :}
1,"I was very impressed with the quality, fit and finish of a brand I've never heard of.  Verus makes a nice case!  Everything lines up and fits tight as it should.  All materials are top quality. The case does not add much bulk to the Note 5.<br /><br />The case was easy to install on my Note 5.  I disagree that the case is hard to take off.  I found it very easy to remove by pushing through with my thumb on the back TPU section while pulling back on the front section with my other index fingers, at the corner where the S-pen is located.<br /><br />I think the case would do a good job at protecting my Note 5 if it fell on it's back, sides, but not the front or on a front angle drop.  The case just doesn't have enough material there. A slightly thicker front TPU lip is needed to increase protection.  Some texture on the sides of the molded poly-carb would help to hold the phone  better.<br /><br />The hair line finish on the back looks very good in person.  Finally, I would recommend this case to anyone looking for moderate protection for their Note 5."
-1,"Broke easily, and is hard to put on and hard to take off too."
1,"Surprising great case, I've been using this for 6 months already and have dropped my phone few times, great protection and fits nice too. I just bought another one for my sister's phone!"
0,"I bought this product , its oky but I could not plug in to my Toyota corolla, anybody knows if it works for Toyota corolla car?"
-1,Loved the color was a true purple but the mic stopped working after a month
1,"Have tried several other trackers, and this is my favorite. I have to make myself exercise, so I want full credit for every step."
1,Workes greatly
1,"They are basic, but work great. The quality of it is better than expected so far. And the magnet on it works so great, It's like it is held by a button. So far very happy with it."
0,This one isn't quite strong enough.  My son-in-law found a better one.  But this works.
1,very pretty
-1,DID NOT WORK
1,I have been wanting a longer iPhone cord and this one works! I have been using it for a few months and it still works fine. Love the added length so it will now reach from the plug to the table.
1,Quality material! Excellent fit on the phone.  Exactly how it was decribed.
-1,stopped working after one use.
-1,I ordered this product because I wanted the adhesive that is pictured with the replacement screen.  When I got the product there was no adhesive.  Very disappointed.
1,nice product
1,its amazing
1,"love the see thru slot for id, love the feel of the case, getting lot of comments, love the closing tab and the phone case holder in the case."
1,Really like this phone.
-1,It was very hard to put on
1,perfect just what i needed
1,Excellent Thank You..
-1,It was really cute when it arrived.. But less than 30 days literally fell apart .. Not worth your time!
1,Perfect
-1,Camera hole is too small and the volume buttons were off.
1,"Works as a replacement iPhone 5S home button.  Remember, there will be no itouch after you replace the button.  The process to replace the buttom is fairly straight forward and easy.  Just check out all the youtube videos.  This came safety packaged"
1,Surprising nice quality. Fits my macbook 2015 perfectly.
1,Bought this and gave them a try and let me tell you how they are had for like a month now bought back in August so for he price is not bad paid like $5.00 dlrs around I have iPhone 6 4.7 with otter box and installation is not that bad the only thing it will not work if u use the otter box because it won't sense your finger its to many plastics so what I did I cut out the screen on my otter box and whola perfect true screen size is a little tight could of use like a couple of millimeters more but besides that I like it no more nosey people peeping on your screen 😆
1,looks good
1,this is amazing quality and it came fast!
1,"Have had lots of compliments.  Very sharp looking, good quality. Love the led display for added privacy of my homescreen. Favorite case so far! It's almost magical how the display appears through the leather case."
-1,Has already cracked after 1st fall. I just need the cover now but have to order the whole set all over again. Price is ok but poor quality.
1,Love my wallet case. I ordered a second one shortly after purchasing my first because once the first falls apart (as all wallets and/or cases do) over time...I wanted a backup on hand! Would easily order more if needed!
1,"These inexpensive cables work fine and feel like good quality.  The packaging is a step up from a blister pack or cheap box, and has some nice notes and thank yous for purchasing the product.  Just opening the box gave me a feeling of quality."
-1,Falls apart quick.  Need a new one or some thing.  Maybe a new replacement for free would be nice.
1,"this battery works well as the one I had, which is as much as I could have expected. I was just hoping it would last longer than the year old one I had been using. I'll have to spend aliitle more next time."
1,Just as described
1,I have them paired with a little Kenwood KAC-M1824BT amp. I have them installed in my Polaris Ranger in the ceiling. The bass is not the best but sound amazing in every way. I will be buying more of these for my boats. I would put these up against any speaker of any maker of any size at any price point. I will personally guarantee that if you install these with a modest amp you will be thrilled! If you don't like them message me through amazon and I will buy them.
1,Bought for my stepdad. He loves it. Fits great. Great protection.
1,"Fit wonderfully, was easy to put on. Great price."
1,"Anker has never disappointed me. I love it. It works well, but it is fairly big and does weigh a bit more than I expected. It's a bit heavy, but it can restore my devices super fast. Worth the money!<br />If I have enough money, I'll buy your amazing new product &#34;Anker PowerCore+&#34;"
-1,Did not work at all
-1,"These headphones will only light up if they are charging. They will not pair with any of my devices. (ipad mini 3, galaxy 6s, windows phone). It is nearly impossible to tell if they are even on or not. Once you unplug, they will not light up again. In the seller instructions, it says that it would connect when the light was blinking red and blue... but it won't even blink. Charged for a few hours, but still nothing. I'm not sure it's even worth returning. Please do not buy these headphones. I'm hoping that the seller will get into contact with me."
1,I thought it was hard case. But it is cute for a cover. Delivery was great
0,With all the research about blue leds messing up circadian rythims you'd figure more manufactures would take the hint and use green instead of blue..  Anyway blue led aside the cable worked for about 6 months of daily use then the connector wore out.  It was nice to have the lit end to find in the dark though.
1,Bought it as a gift and my parents love it.
1,"I'm an elephant collector, I may be a bit biased but I love this case! I can keep my ID inside it, the phone fits perfectly!! I would love to get another one in a different color."
0,"The case is slim, sleek and convenient. However, a few of the SIM slots are loose. Most SIM cards or adapters I put in the slots end up bouncing around in case and I need to be careful when opening it to ensure they do not fall out."
1,Excellent Thank You..
-1,"Terrible. Screen protector not even as wide as my note 4 screen, doesn't stick well on the edges."
1,VERY NICE GOOD PRICE
1,Came quickly and great feel. Will buy again in other colors.
1,"Lovin it thus far. I got this to keep in my pocket along with a small portable power pack and love them both. Before I would run out of juice before making it to my car but now I'm good. Because it's in my pocket all the time I wonder how long it will last before the little cable is wore out but if I get 6 months out of it I will be happy. If I don't, I'll be sure to revisit this review."
-1,I purchased this because I wanted a wall charger for some 26650 batteries.  It is unreasonably difficult to insert batteries of size 26650 into the charger.  plus they don't appear to seat correctly.  I returned this for this reason as well as the fact that it arrived damaged.  Smaller batteries will most likely fit much better.
1,The case is very good.<br />However it is clunky and makes the phone much heavier.
1,Charger works fine. But I had searched for &#34;iphone 6 car charger&#34; and this popped up so I never even thought to confirm it was actually for an iPhone 6 since I'd specifically typed that. Used the car base and bought a new cord. Not sure if Amazon or seller/Belkin was misleading but a pain either way. But the car charger base works just fine.
1,"Excellent protection for the Samsung Galaxy S4.  It is soft, pliable, and easy to install."
-1,terrible fit and sound
1,love it!
1,Good screen protector!
0,Good
-1,"This phone is no good.  The screen goes off and on, and it is not even a year old.  Don't be selling phones to customers that wouldn't even last a year.  Besides, the screen goes blank every time."
1,Great fit!
1,"Well, it's been 3 years since my purchase, and this case is still working for me.  No it may not be water-proof, but put the phone ina  plastic bag or thin layer of plastic, put the excess to the back, put this phone case back on and there you go, it's semi-water proof at that point at least.  That got me through rainy work days when I had to work outside.  Either way this case has caused my phone to survive alot, I wore some pants that had awful pocket slots on them and it kept falling out of my pocket while mountain biking on pavement, my phones going on 3 years just fine.  Other than that I have also exercised extreme caution with my phone, I rarely, if ever, drop my phone under any circumstances.  This case has a great grip to it which isn't easily dropped.  I can't really say enough about this, I got mine for $5.00, however I see the price is now at about $9.97,  still a good deal, most definitely."
1,The Bluetooth did not work with my iphone6. But it a great product
1,Love the lace look it!
1,"Beautiful packaging and wonderful directions that went with it! I usually have bad luck with putting on screen protectors rather crooked or tones of bubbles but with the tools they give you along the clear and easy to follow directions, it was a peace of cake and I don't mean to brag but mine is on there pretty perfect! The clarity is like nothing is on my screen no  cloudiness what so ever also the cover feels like the apple glass so going from no cover to this was seamless!"
1,Works great although the rubber handle slides a lot.
1,works great
-1,Sucks!
1,Great band.  Comfortable and fits nice.
1,"Excellent product. Initial purchase had one problem in that USB end broke inexplicably. However, once I contacted support team at Native Union, they were swift in apologising and sending me a new cable in the post ( which is working fine ). Product is really useful in that 3 metre solid fibre cable allows so much more flexibility for usage while using far away plug points. The moveable weight ball is also a simple yet genius idea as it enables the stability of knowing that IPhone won't slide off and fall/smash on the floor. Combined with the excellent customer service at Native Union I would strongly recommend this product. This a company that really values its customers, well done NU!"
1,"Very good product, and on time delivered"
1,works well
1,camera use
-1,Border case wore out within a couple of weeks
-1,Made a squealing noise no matter which channel it was on
1,Just as it says it is. Sounds great. Easy install. Would buy again.
1,"no 'device not supported' message, I've been using this charging cable for at least 6 months, no issues"
1,I love my case...
1,"I use this all the time, works great."
1,Works exactly as it should and even charges my S6 with a case on.  It'd be 5 stars if it came with it's on plug in USB adapter.
1,"NICE PRINT OF OLD GLORY,LIKE IT VERY MUCH"
-1,It broke the 2nd time I used it. :(
1,Works great
1,"Decent enough, it has come up a bit in one corner and has a scratch on it. Saved my phone from getting that scratch."
1,"Selfie stick works great, all you have to do is plug it into your phone & go. The only issue I had was with the packaging. The box was a little smashed and the only instructions for the device was on the back of the box in extremely small print. Luckily it was easy to figure out on my own. I purchased this product at a discount for my honest review."
1,This is the last case you'll ever buy!!! Dog & Bone cases are the real deal and are superior to Lifeproof cases. I say this because a threw my Lifeproof in the garbage and took the chance on the Dog & Bone case. With this case I get the same protection without the muffled sound which is what sold me. Plus the case is far more pleasant to look at. Also their customer service is A++ they responded to my emails within minutes. Overall you can't go wrong with this case or company they are awesome.
1,"I tried one then went and bought 3 more for my kids' cars. so much better than suction cup devices or gluing something to your dash. Although designed for a phone without a case, they work fine with LifeProof and other cases. Horizontal or vertical and with power cable plugged in. I can now use the iPhone with Waze(r) as my primary GPS, in place of my bulky, outdated Garmin GPS that I can retire.<br /><br />Small, lightweight but does the trick. Seems solid and clever way to hold your phone."
-1,Missing part and it was advertised for iphone6 it was for iPhone 5
1,Fast service. Product was as described.
1,its great. But its hard to get off the phone  ;D
0,Fit as expected
1,relley good
1,Perfect solution to replacement of battery in Galaxy 3 phone. Price is great and no issues with working right away.
1,for a fair review they provided me with a discount code. great product
-1,Item not received in Apple box. They were both in a plastic bag. The cable might be own but can't tell for sure since its white. The wall charger adaptor is a knock off because it has no apple logo on it and says happy on it made in China. Not what I was expecting at all.
1,"This was just what I needed for a recent road trip. Everyone was able to charge their phone and the product worked well. Charged rapidly and didn't overheat. Liked the labeling on the product which shows the charge number for phone or tablet. Overall, I'm pleased with this product."
1,"Great stand, I would recommend it to anyone who wants the ability to charge their watch and phone at the same time.  I use mine with a 42mm watch and a iPhone 6 plus so size is no issue.  My only wish is better cable management, the watch cable stays put well but the one for the phone has to be tied around the base.  It works but some kind of clip holding the phone cord in place would be nice so it doesn't fall to the floor when not in use."
1,Item came as described. Only wished they had included a screen protector for the phone.
-1,Doesn't connect instantly. Takes several minutes to connect to iPhone and be able to listen to music. I went back to aux cord.
1,=)
1,Product feels like it is good quality. I hope to get a few years out of this. I feel confident about this product.
1,"Works just as advertised. The operation takes some getting used to but it is a great unit for the price. The play button can be a little unresponsive given that three buttons are in pretty close proximity, so it will take some practice to be able to nail it on the first try."
1,Adorable!
1,"Very easy to put on because it's a glass plate and not a plastic film.<br />But it cracks easily. I don't drop my phone that much and when I do it's a small drop with no damage, but the few times I've dropped my phone this screen protector cracks. I'm glad my actual phone screen didn't, but I don't think it would've anyways. I've bought 2 of these now and they have only lasted a couple weeks before cracking from a small drop.<br />Other than cracking easily this is a good screen protector."
0,Too bulky
1,"I love this product! It's very lightweight and durable. It also has two pockets for mostly used cards or an ID pocket. What surprised me is the small mirror it came with, great idea..not too bulky! It arrived in a very sturdy package to protect it. I would buy another, to gift for a friend."
1,"Great case, protects well, not impossible to remove, looks nice. Kickstand is a bit flimsy bug I never really use it anyways."
1,Best price and good quality
1,It works better than my other 10 feet cord!!! Hope I can take care of it instead of buying it all over again!!! 😁😆
1,Really good
1,This is an excellent watch and fitness tracker.  Ordering was easy and arrived on time (even on a Sunday).  I have been very impressed by the watch and would recommend highly.
-1,Received my easay2pick takgs(2) about 2 weeks ago. It doesn't work. I guess Ill have to spend a small fortune buying 4 new batteries. Anyy ets that wont fix the problem?
1,This makes carrying everything in you want in one place.
1,Came super early not the exact color but it's cute
1,"Very good price, works very well. I plugged my I phone 5 direct to the charger. This power adapter which can be used for input AC110-240V and output 5VDC/1A. It charged very fast. Great products. I am very happy with this adapter and will buy it again."
1,Exactly what I wanted.
1,"Bought it for my kids. So far works great , no complains."
1,"I purchased the iPhone 6 sport armband in green it's a great color just like the pic.  These are stitched well, the neoprene is soft and strong, it's pretty comfortable. I haven't worked out with it but I can tell you it's perfect for playing with your kids at the playground, after you get used to it you forget you're wearing it.  My phone fit even with a slim bumper case on (youvogue); and the touchscreen, while not as sensitive, was still usable through the vinyl face on this and with the tempered glass screen protector.  The little key slot is too small for an automotive chip key but I didn't even notice that it had one in the description so I didn't buy it for that anyway. You could tuck some cash in there.  All in all its a great piece of gear and I will use it a lot.  Love the fun colors!<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,"This is the one of the best cases I have ever purchased! I had one for my ZTE Savvy phone by Straight Talk, and the only reason I sold it is that the phone just quit working! I would have kept this case, except that it would not fit my present phone, contrary to another Amazon review.  Too bad! If you are thinking about getting this case, go ahead, and I don't think you will regret it!!"
1,The only downside to this cable is the end that goes into the phone has a larger cover than the official Apple branded cable. It still works great though.
-1,Loses satellite in open areas turns off when your in heavy traffic can't read the screen in sunlight.. Good thing you can play games at least it's not a total loss just 99%
1,cant not go wrong for this price and these are great!!
0,"I received this product for an unbiased view.<br /><br />First of all, I love that these headphones work with Bluetooth. Cordless is a great idea for exercising! However, unfortunately I have had difficulty with these headphones cutting in and out. I have used these headphones to listen to music while biking outside, with my phone in my pocket. There were a number of occasions where it sounded like my music skipped, which I know never happens when I used corded headphones. Other than the occasional skipping, these headphones are pretty awesome"
1,We gave this to our granddaughter for her birthday.  She LOVES it!  She's 18 going on 35.  :)
1,"It worked as advertised.  Plugged it in, turned on pairing and paired to phone, clicked the go button to find a station, tuned radio to station and hit play on Apple music.  This has solved a daily problem with 3 kids and 2 adults that had to rotate a very long AUX cable around the truck to play each other's music.  Another daily problem solved!!!"
1,Product as described
-1,Damaged product
-1,"Works great, but only for a very short limit of time.<br />Maybe, 1 or 2 months, then you must to buy a new one."
1,"Just what i was looking for. For the price it works just as i had hoped, some minor issues bring it down a bit but a solid buy for the price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />sturdy table clamp (very adjustable)<br />Long tapering neck (it is malleable and stays where you bend it, which was a nice surprise)<br />Table/phone clamp (i think its spring loaded but it had a good grip on my table so i know it wont go any where)<br />Clamp Opening (has slits on the sides to allow u to plug in the charger and head phones if used in landscape)<br /><br />Cons:<br />sags a bit (I have a Galaxy Tab 4 8in so its a smaller tablet and when i put it it leans forward a little bit, because i watch it in my bed, so i just need to bend it higher to compensate, nothing terrible)<br />Clamp Openings(bc i have a smaller tablet the speaker plug is blocked when i need to charge the tablet and vice versa<br /><br />its a good buy for the price"
1,Awesome
-1,wish i hadnt bought it.
1,Does what I expected it to.  Absolutely essential on a Fitbit Charge.
1,Solves the problem of not being able to plug in anywhere
1,works perfect
1,Sounds great. Fit perfect in my 02 escape.
1,Grandson loves it
1,god job
1,"What a great little unit.. Ordered this for my father in law and we used it over the weekend.  I used a laser rangefinder and he used this.<br />It was spot on.<br /><br />PROS:  Superlight, accurate, small, easy to read, user friendly<br /><br />Cons:  no slope meter... thats it!<br /><br />Loved it... I almost want one for when I cant see the hole... thats when laser is useless"
1,perfect
1,"Perfect for quickly charging all of my Apple devices at once. A must have if you are a family with multiple tablets, phones, etc."
1,"Great product, shipping was really fast"
1,Daughter loves it! very cute. great price for a well made case.
1,Works great
1,Perfect fit for the Samsung S5. and well made with good material.  Thanks!!!
1,"It adheres easily to the screen , no bubbles . I like it !"
1,Fast shipment and product seems  to do it's job
-1,It won't fit my iPhone 6 plus.
1,"Easy to put on ! Very good quality ive bought these before and got flimsy cheaply made ones i was very satisfied with this one it was sturdy and went on easily , a must for anyone looking to protect theyre precious screen!"
-1,This headset outs terrible. My husband is used to the lg but we got this one for fear of getting a knock off version of his beloved lg set. This had no range and I can barley heart him when he talks. I purchased out awhile back for him. He keeps putting it in the drawer for use if his beloved lg broke again. This week the inevitable did happen and yes he went to using this thing. He hates it and I hate hearing about how much he hates it.  Now if you do not have a superior set you've used previously it may be ok for you. He has to have an easy too hide set so it doesn't show on his uniform at work with good range. He also listens tho music all the time too when He's running and working out. He's on the phone all the time and it has to be something easily hidden and comfortable to use. For some reason it seems tho be just the opposite for him. So anyway this it's my honest review but like I said you may not be as picky as he is.
0,"Solidly mediocre. Yes, it does the job, but it feels like it will nearly break the cd slots on my and my wife's car. It also feel a bit cheap. If I could do it over, I'd likely pass on this mount."
-1,"Unit Detects as expected for the price, compass does not work correctly. city button continues to stick and can not set while mounted to window.<br />power supply quit working, I opened and found the ground wire had come off, after soldering back it worked. after trying unit , I will most likely not buy another whistler unit."
-1,"The band looks good, but cannot be adjusted small enough for my wrist. I have an average women's size wrist for 5&#34;4&#34; and 125#"
1,Follow the simple easy instructions and your screen protector will be installed correctly.  I used 2 of the 3 sticky tabs to hold it in place.  The screen protector is not noticeable and it doesn't interfere with the touch screen.  I had NO bubbles to contend with.  It took about 2 minutes to put it on.  Highly recommend!  I also signed up for the awesome lifetime warranty.  I hope I don't need to use ti!
0,Very difficult to get on. Had one for my 4s and it fit fine. Not sure it is not a knock off. Came in a clear plastic bag!
1,Great case.
1,great product
1,As expected.
1,Works very well!
-1,item is scratch
1,"I bought these for the wireless feature. They are better than I expected, the sound is excellent and when talking on the phone everyone can hear me fine. I would buy these again"
-1,"I returned this item since it overheated during the initial charging.  I had to use a towel to unplug it. At that time it still wasn't fully charged (not all lights lit.  It was a good thing I didn't just plug it in and leave it unattended.  That said, I would not have left a review if I hadn't gotten several emails from the company begging me to provide a favorable review."
0,"This case is solidly built and all, but it is just bulky and the volume buttons are being pressed in it constantly. Also the strap wraps the arm in an awkward way, where there is a space between your arm and the strap in the corners ... I guess it's build for someone with thick arm. It's just OK IMHO."
1,"It works for the htc tmobile my touch 4g, it works great"
1,"This is a Great cell phone holder. first the most impressive. it actually HOLDS on to a textured dash. if you move it often all it takes is a little water to clean it and make it stick again. it has so few moving parts no gears or flimsy plastic pieces that eventually break with repeated use. it is slightly awkward to put a phone in one handed but can be done with a little practice. one con, its so short that if you keep your phone vertical and not near the edge of your dash getting a power cord in. well worth it."
1,It was what I expected and as described by the seller
1,Like it a lot.
1,It worked great while I had it I recently upgraded to a different phone
1,Great it works perfect
1,Great
1,great item at a great proce...
1,Awesome product...
1,"It does work well with my iPhone 5c, however, because of the phone protector I have, the cord that came with it will not fit into my phone.  But I can use the cord that came with the phone and it works fine."
1,"Excellent product.  I am rarely so pleased with electronic cords, but this one is exceptional."
-1,Could not get the channels I wanted. Hard to tune.
-1,"This case Sucks! !!! The hole for the sound is on the wrong side,  the sound button keeps turning the phone down, the power button turns the phone off and then after it restarts a few times the phone goes in safe mode cause the buttons are in the wrong spot. I had to cut mine with a razor to get it to work."
1,"Love the battery pack. Anker is absolutely one of the best. It does not come with a charger itself, so you have to use the charged supplied with your phone or tablet. It also didn't come with a cable/adapter to fit the charger I have. Aside from that...no comlaints, just wish it came with these needed accessories."
0,"The case covers the proximity sensor, so when ending a call, even with the phone away from your face, the screen is blanked.  A bluetooth or wired headphone connection will eliminate that.  But I always don't have one of those with me to use.  I wish I could find a non-rooting way to disable the prox sensor."
-1,These stopped working just 2 days after I received them. Very displeased.
-1,The pizza decal is bubbling and the pink part broke off on day 1.
1,Solved my recharging issues.  Works great!
1,"Nice size and does charge, just not my Samsung S"
1,Works well on my indoor cycle
1,Life saver was on a cross country flight 3+ hours and forgot to charge my iPhone before take off.  I was able to plug this in a 5% and it brought it to a full charge and kept it charged until we landed. Holds it internal charge for a good time as well my flight was on a Friday and I charged it the Friday before and was still fully charged.<br /><br />Highly recommend this goes on all my trips with me now. Will be picking up a second one to keep in my backpack for work.
1,They're gooby
0,"well the case does a good job protecting the phone as its raised on the front side. However, the &#34;carbon fiber&#34; fabric on the back easily starts to tear off. Also, it slips in your hand a bit. I'm now looking for a rubber case because of that and the poor quality of the back."
0,Already starting to fall apart!!!!!!
-1,Only held battery charge for 40 minutes
1,Works great!
1,Good Item fits well and is a solid piece
1,"Fantastic value, great for using your phone as a GPS or watching movies on your lunch break.  The suction cup has had to be restuck once in the four months that I have owned it, and that was during the hot hot heat of the summer."
1,"This is the best case that I have ever had for my IPhone period.<br /><br />The features I like:<br />* The kick stand is a really cool feature, great for watching you tube videos.<br />* The outer edge is made from a rubber like material, making it non slip.<br />* the clip on cover has a velour material that covers the screen further protecting it from scratches.<br />* Lightweight<br />* low profile, easily fits in my front pocket even with the snap on cover.<br /><br />If you want to protect your phone then you need this case. Just get a third party screen protector and you will be all set.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like is the kickstand is a little hard to deploy when you first get it. As you use it more it gets a little easier to extend."
1,it charges fast
1,works well with my phone
-1,Not what I exspected
1,good
1,So so. Almost a 3 star but it's small and has most of the connections I need.
1,"Best phone I've ever owned. Not the fastest processor ever, not the best looking screen ever, not the best camera ever, but darn does it get good battery life. I can regularly go 48hrs on a single charge. If I start a day at 100%, even using lots of data and navigating with the GPS, I still have 40%+ by the end of the day. It's great. I'll gladly give up some of the fancy features to not ever be tied down to a phone charger again."
1,Looks really nice and it also protects my apple.
1,Terrific!
0,This case broke within a week.
-1,Order the product on August 11th. The wrist-let strap just broke. Not satisfied with the quality the design and functionality are great though. Definitely prefer function over fashion.
-1,Ordered this product in purple came on time but the color purple was not as the picture it was more raspberry  returned  it!!!
1,Good cables
-1,One of the pieces was not working at all. I won't buy them again.
-1,Item was not as picture shown the dimensions are off
1,Yes it did
1,"Excellent product. Holds my HTC phone well in both convertible and SUV. No problems with heat or vibration, phone and mount stays in place."
1,CAN YOU SAY &#34;BLING&#34;?  These covers are so pretty and affordable you can get several!!
1,excellent product!
1,Worked great for me.  Used the suggested library and displayed bmp files from the sd card.  Have not yet tried displaying text.
-1,"Looks like all the reviews EXCEPT the low rated ones are from users the received them for free, hell give me a pair for free and I will review them to. I sure ain't gona buy them..."
1,Use this during a week in the sierra's at a Summer Camp for a couple of adults who had to try and keep 11 boys organized. Worked great. The rechargeable battery last almost 4 days before having to charge or change to batteries. Like the option to use rechargeable or regular batteries.
1,Perfect replacement thank you
1,beautiful
-1,The cables are poorly constructed and fell apart on first use
1,Very Pretty! :)
-1,"Was very upset, I ordered the New Mexico cover and in stead I got the Minnesota cover. Have no other complaints  on any other orders."
1,"Easiest screen protector I have ever installed. No bubbles from the start.<br /><br />Update:<br />After less than one week, protector is chipping and has cracks from bottom corner in to the button. Never seen this before."
1,"The phone itself is great. The windows operating system is good but doesn't have all the apps you might find on android or apple. Most of the popular apps are there, but my schools app isn't available on it."
-1,I love the look and how easy it was to put on and take off of my phone. I have had this style of case previously. However this one seems SO flimsy that I don't feel like it is protective at all against drops. So I'm using a different one.
1,Works really well. I have my Samsung S6 in a otterbox defender case and it charges with no problem.
-1,The product arrived broken
1,Good Quality product.
-1,not for iphones  it charges it but I need to still attach my I Phone charger  cord
1,"exactly what we needed, received in a timely fashion."
1,"works well and does the job. Screen protector works well, too. Easy to apply. I have basic experience in applying screen protectors."
1,This is the best cases ever
1,It is what I was looking for with the flexibility and waterproof.
1,excellent
0,Keep collecting dust and finger prints but fast  shipping product just ok
1,"Easy to install, looks great!"
1,for my neighbor. she said it fits fine. and it a good color.
1,Great product.
1,great one i like it
-1,Lasted 2 months
0,Got the charger about a week or so ago and while it does work I am lucky that i have 2 cigarette lighters  because the chstger does not fit in the outlet specifically made for charging.  Disappointing but works.  Won't be recommending this to anyone
0,Its good for the price
1,Very good produt
1,"Finally a charger that can keep up with the power drain of running my navigation software on my iPad Air on the boat. Even when starting with a full charge and charging all day, the iPad would die on a long day. While this doesn't maintain a 100% charge, the loss is minimal."
1,Works as expected.  I turn car on it turns on and connects to my phone without issue.  Mostly use it for streaming but call quality is very good as well.
1,To me. It's great  hook it  up  the same day.<br />Fast shipping.<br />Great product  all around!
-1,"To our surprise, everything what could possibly fall apart, fell apart in less than 3 days. Not happy with this product, we had to throw it away as it was not serving it's purpose and it was not possible to put it together again."
1,I bought this case straight from Griffin and I love it and the camo color. I have had Griffin Survivor cases since the IPhone 4 and they just keep improving. No more camera flap on this case. The screen protector on this case is awesome too. It doesn't sacrifice typing like the Otterbein where there is a pocket of air in between the case and the protector so you have to press hard. No air pocket in this case. Just buy it yet u won't be disappointed!
1,"I like this phone. My wife, my mom, and I each have one and they suit our needs."
1,"It's a pretty decent stick, the pole could be a bit heavier made, but for under $8, cant beat it."
1,"On the positive:  light weight, comfortable, loads GPS quickly and accurate, battery life as advertised; easy to add aps; syncs well with iPhone.  On the negative:  the screen is dark, so far unable to control the lap times, cannot toggle to watch mode while also in running mode.  Still learning."
1,Well my daughter like this
1,works great
1,Great cleaner.
1,Fits great. Get tons of compliments.
1,"[[VIDEOID:c06d54005ac3a75238af74d8c87477]]I bought this cell phone case Iphone 6 by Collen for my sister because she needed a case that is not too girly. There were many colors to choose from but decided to get the yellow and black. When it arrived, I was surprised at how now nice the case looks. I bought the yellow and black. There are actually two parts for this case. The yellow part is a very bright color which is made from flexible silicone and the black part is removal which is a stand and is made out of plastic.One thing I like about this product is that there is a glass screen protector included with this case. Instead of buying a separate screen protector this you get everything you need in this product. The stand is pretty sturdy, very useful for when watching a video. I had the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for my own honest opinion and I am glad I did."
1,"Clear sound and works great with my phone, laptop and tablet! Love it"
1,"Amazing car mount. Plenty of way to get it attached to any phone you have. I have a Note 3 and my girlfriend has a iphone 6, works great with both. Suction cup has a strong hold on windshield or dash (tested it on the dash and needed some force to take it off). Metal plate for magnet holder slipped right under my battery cover without any bulging. Great mount for reasonable price. Very satisfied!!****"
1,Works great as a mini tripod to take photos with and also for a hand held selfi smartphone supporter. It's easy to mount your smartphone to the tripod and once mounted your phone is held in place no matter how much you move the tripod.
-1,Came with everything except the sticky seal needed to keep the screen in the case (and not dangling out).  I would recommend you find another supplier who included that seal.
0,"Love the case itself but the clip snapped off within 2 weeks. Now my husband slides it in his pants pocket, he would rather it were attached at his waist. I would expect it from a $10 case, not $26 plus!"
-1,chinese crap
1,"Awesome product. Very nice and sleek. I usually charge 4 devices at once, two iPhones and two iPads, and it does it with ease. Plus, it has a great warranty."
1,"good product it helps me a lot, when i'm driving just put it on my dash and will charge from the sun."
-1,case did not properly fit on one corner and was very loose
1,Great cord. Everything I wanted at a great price. Shipping was fast too.
1,"NewTrent did it again with this case... an instant winner here!<br />Match this with a tempered glass screen protector and everyone will envy you!<br />It you want strength and durability without the bulk get this case... I have been using this same model on my iPhone 5, 6 and 6 plus... I have tried many others and none come close in offering such complete protection in a small form factor and the removal back plates are a nice touch to color match your iPhone. I am even considering pickling up a few as gifts this Christmas as everyone in my family is always complementing my Trentium cases."
0,it's ok
1,This screen protector fit perfectly on the LG Utimate 2 and was easy to apply.  It definitely protects the screen and keeps it clean and smear proof.
1,The 1 URPOWER pack that I am using on my one cordless phone that died is working very well.
1,"Worked great, until I squeezed it a bit to hard to make it adhere to the glue strips. On the next one, I will warm up the adhesive first."
1,My first case fidnt get delivered  so they sent a new one right away. It is everything i was looking for. It is good quality and holding up very well.
0,Doesn't stay charged long.
1,Does what it says. I keep it on my dash and has not fallen off yet.
0,"I like this skin, the matte covering feels nice, and definitely wards off fingerprints. I was using a plastic shell for this before I ordered this skin.<br /><br />The overall feel is really nice, the material feels different than other stickon skins, way more durable.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this is application. They give you a small spray bottle of water and a little soap or something, I'm not positive what is in the tube. You spray this on the skin, and then apply this to the product. This allows you to approximate placement and slide things into place to make sure it all gets fit properly.<br /><br />This is great for the most part, however I am concerned that there are actually small pockets of this liquid trapped under the skin against my product, that will eventually cause damage. They guarantee a perfect application, but I can't tell if the entire product is adhering to the n3DS, or if there are sill small pockets of water under the skin, even if the skin feels defect free. I removed the skin for the inner faces of my 3ds because of this concern, I saw that water was being held in the indentations for the words START and SELECT, and additionally for the other etchings for the volume and 3d slides on the top face. I attempted to use as little spray as needed, but the adhesive is extremely sticky, and the amount of liquid you need to use causes pooling around the edges of the skin pieces, of which I was worried might damage the speakers or run into the device and get behind the screen.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is about the actual screen protector sections. This could have been done FAR better. See this product: [[ASIN:B00RZ7T8TK HORI Screen Protective Filter for Nintendo NEW 3DS XL]] This product has a very well done application using pull tabs and no water. I had to remove the lower screen protector twice because it shifted and then stuck hard to the screen, and had to pick up a corner with a fingernail to get it to center.<br /><br />The skin isVERY high quality, but it took so long to apply it, and I had to use water on an electronic device... my device is fine but I really question the design here, if a younger child got this and attempted the application process, would they understand not to drown the device to prevent damage?"
1,good
0,"Works pretty well, but it barely fits a Samsung Note 4 (near impossible with the case on), and it busted my air vent after a couple of weeks.  It might be ok with sturdier air vents, but I'd be careful.  Something spring loaded that grips the sides of the air vent chamber might be a better design."
1,neutral
-1,"The case is fine and the battery last as long as I need it. However, the audio jack extender broke within two weeks of purchase and since I listen to music often I am very upset."
1,"When I had read all the mixed reviews, I decided what the hey as this would only set me back a few bucks. I purchased model 088 in red for an upcoming camping trip. When I opened the box, there was the radio, battery, & a small set of instructions on a piece of paper (which is nice, considering that per the reviews, I believe none of them had instructions). I decided not to program the radio channels in the radio, due to reading that once it's programmed, then you can't remove non stations. I also like the fact that the volume was a dial & not buttons, because then I could finely adjust the volume to the desired level.<br /><br />Overall, I was very pleased with the sound quality & complete play time of the radio. For it being such a small radio (think 2000s cell phone w/ qwerty size), I was impressed overall. The complete play time (with a fully charged battery- which takes approximately 3-4 hrs to fully charge) from start to finish was about 10 hrs. I used a micro sd card to play my music. The only thing is, if you are someone who wants to know what's playing, it only shows the number of the song. So I would recommend either putting different genres on different cards, or making an accompanying song list to reference. When the radio was turned off & turned back on, it picks right up where it was stopped.<br /><br />The FM radio reception was good & had no issues with it.<br /><br />Needless to say, the camping trip was more enjoyable with a little music to soundtrack to. I recommend this radio to anyone who is looking for a decent radio at a low cost."
1,Its great
1,Perfect!...
0,You get what you pay for. If you buy a cheap screen the colour balance will not be great. Other than a sepia tone the screen functions well. I liked their instructions that they included.
1,This case was bought as a gift for my brother. I already have the Otter Box.
-1,I BOUGHT 3 charger one charger the input not working
1,Love that this came fully charged!! Perfect size to throw in your purse for those days that you need it in an emergency. Fast delivery- nicely made charger!
-1,It looked better on the site than in person
0,"It beats not having a case on your phone but that's about it. The fit is not tight, the stylus that comes with it is very cheap, the screen cover is not good either. I would have asked for a refund id I would have spent any more than 9.99 for it."
1,This case is an excellent value. I find I like it better than the Pelican case I am replacing it with.
1,"Plugs bend up into the cube, making it a perfect cube. Masterfully simplistic design, hats off to your engineers!"
1,I love my speaker and use it with computer and also to listen to music off my android cell phone and love how it can be set any where in your home and not need to be plugged into computer / phone / power outlet / etc. to use - It comes with usb and aux. cords and to charge it you have two choices : usb on computer or in a usb  phone charger into the wall outlet !
1,EXCELLENT SERVICE GREAT
1,Fast charging. Works well with my phones and tablets.
-1,My product stopped working only after 5 weeks . To late to return. :(
1,"Excellent product, good range, excellent service."
1,EXCELENTE
1,Awesome product. Kids in back seat can charge and use your phone!
1,I love this case. I collect owls. It is durable. I have drop my phone with no damage. Fast shipping. excellent packaging. I would buy from this seller again.
1,"So handy for reading with my Galaxy Note 5.. I wanted a small, heavy unit that would not tip with the weight or height of the phone. This fit the bill perfectly. I love it"
1,I love it
1,Great great great!!!!!
0,"It came well packaged and easy to open. It has a somewhat easy to read manual and you definitely need to read it (more than once). I'm very good with electronics and I've owned quite a few bluetooth headphones but these are difficult to use. It took me a long frustrating time to connect it to my phone. Once connected everything worked like it should. I was looking forward to the camera button feature and it works but I don't think it's worth it after everything else. The earbuds aren't that loud and I don't like the way they look in your ears. These have some nice features and a great bonus headset but I would not recommend these. They're bulky, the charger cover doesn't shut all the way, and they aren't easy to use. All of that together they are not worth the price! The seller is nice and I have no doubt they will refund or replace the item but I feel like I would run into the same problems and it's not worth the time to refund them. I purchased this product at a discount and this is an HONEST review. Please ask me your questions before marking this review unhelpful."
1,"So let me start off by saying these Bluetooth headphones are amazing. I have been using them for a couple of days now and they meet all my expectations. I can barley tell there even there and they are very comfortable. My big thing is that I needed a headphone set that would not fall out my ears and this fit perfect. The sound quality is amazing, it hits the lows, highs, and mids all really well. The only reason I did not give five stars is because sometimes the music cuts out it is not very often though so I can't complain. Overall great product!!"
1,"Worked as advertised, great price arrived on time and no problems. Would recommend"
-1,Can't. Get a phone to fit it
1,It's super fun I just wish it were more useful and protected my phone more. I wish it had bumpers for the screen. I switched this cover out for a two part ultra-protection case and I noticed a dramatic change in protection.
1,Excellent product
-1,"Loved it at first! Recieved my second one from my dad about 4 months later who didn't care for it and got something else.  Less than a year later both are dead...I used these head phones all the time, when i worked out, in the car, around the house. Because i used them so much i was also very careful with them. They both stopped working about 2 months apart. No idea why. the noise cancelation still turns on but the actual bluetooth (headphones) don't turn on. I've tried everything i can think of but no luck. No idea where my dad got his from but i doupt they were from the same batch. I'm really disappointed in these even though i really liked them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />very comfortable and light weight. Forgot they were even around my neck many times.<br />pretty decent range<br />volume was loud enough<br />all the buttons you would need for calls or music and easy to locate(feel) without much fumbling around<br /><br />Cons:<br />2 died in less than a year<br />noise cancelation was barely noticable (never really used it)<br />low battery indicator cut out music when it sounded<br /><br />Those are my only complaints... would have been a five star if they hadn't died."
1,"Amazing, at first I was a bit skeptical about this case seeing as I would use it with my iPhone 5s but I have no regrets. It worked perfectly, I followed the instructions on the manual and tested it with a piece of paper (it was a success) after the initial test I decided it was trust worthy enough to place my phone inside. It worked just fine in the pool.<br /><br />I'm some of the reviews I noticed that lots of people had a problem with the cable thing that allows you to place it around your neck. Simple solution to that, just use a key chain instead of the flimsy part on the neck tie (tie the key chain to the main part of the neck tie and not to the detachable part) this will stop it from breaking and even if it does break the keychain will hold it up.<br /><br />Highly recommended product!"
1,works perfect
-1,I refuse to give this item a rating I followed every step and this item doesn't work so don't waste your money
1,it works very nice with 850 3G
0,Didn't quiet fit device but at least it has some type of coverage.
-1,"Junk, Beltronics Pro 500 falls offs constantly. Save your $$$$  Going for a mirror mount next."
1,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but this case is awesome, so I had to. It actually makes the note 5 more comfortable to hold. It has a nice feel and is well made. Grips the phone tightly, however simple to take off to clean dust and build up under the case. I bought this exact case when I had my S6 edge and it fit awesome on that as well. Don't hesitate, buy this."
-1,I tried to use this map on a 7 day backpacking trip in Glacier national park. Sometimes the maps didn't work when too close to the Canadian border? I would recommend using a map instead and leaving your GPS at home for back country backpacking in Glacier.
1,I love this holding up very well.  Worth every penny.
1,"I wish it were just a bit wider to cover more, but it shipped quickly,  and is staying on even though my phone goes in and out of my pocket and purse multiple times a day."
1,Been using this for a while now.  Still works great.  It's small and fits really well.
0,"Screen scratched quickly.  My previous Lifeproof was in my pocket all the time and never scratched.  This one has a perm scratch.  Protects from water and sweat, but screen needs to go back to the previous material (I assume they changed it since it reacted so different in this model.)"
0,works best with iphone not well with our droid though people have a problem hearing us on the droid
-1,The description of this item was so not true!! It cracked and never even dropped my phone!! False advertisement!!!👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
-1,"Great idea. App works well too. But the band itself is highly unreliable. In the 14 months since purchase, Jawbone has replaced the device four times, and this week's replacement (a new and &#34;improved&#34; version called UP2) has lasted less than two weeks before dying.<br /><br />It no longer pairs with the iPhone. What a waste of time and also money."
1,Durable for everyday use by my 7 years old. The rotating center of the cover attachment functions as an excellent finger grip to hold onto the slippery iPad. The cover padding is thick and firm to protect the touch screen from any inadvertent shock. The padded snap-on back cover provides reasonable drop protection to the corners and to the side edges.
-1,Did not work. Glad I paid $9 for it.
1,Surface area on this magnet holds my Note 4 perfectly. I bought products like this in the past that couldnt hold my Note 4. I was happy to find that this one did.
1,Was exactly what I needed and at a good price.
1,"Thick, but EXTREMELY flexible wire.  Has good quality feel.  Superior redesign from their original models.  Also own sevrral Kopi high-current cables (which are also highly recommended), but these are better for the money!"
1,Best case available IMHO.
0,"The case was very effective at keeping my phone dry, but I found the plastic casing made it difficult to use the photo functions.  It was very frustrating in that regard as I thought I had taken advantage of many underwater photo opportunities and later discovered I had not!"
1,This fits my Droid razr maxx hd like a glove. Thanks..
-1,Can't hear on the left ear!
-1,"Had an OtterBox for my S4.  After getting the S5, I opted to try a new case - mistake.  I had my phone less than a month and my 4 year old dropped it onto the floor.  Hit on the side and the screen got a crack across it.  Obviously, didn't protect from a simple fall."
1,Great quality sound and design!
1,Great product & servicr
-1,Don't fit well in ears
1,"I traveled overseas to Thailand, and this helped out tremendously on 8 hour tours of the city."
1,It is flexible and brings in good reception
-1,They were not anti-scratch.
1,This was perfect for my 4 month old to stay occupied during our road trip! It was a life saver!
1,I love this soooooo much!
-1,"Didn't work for me , but the color is a perfect match."
1,good
1,I bought them for my 67 hear old mom & they're great. She loves them.
1,"Thanks, can't wait to try them!"
1,Very nice product very good quality love it I recommend it
1,Fits perfectly on my phone.  Looks and feels great.. Does not diminish any visuals.
1,"Nice radio, perfect size, works well, programing requires some research if you haven't done it before,  I spent 2 hrs to get my windows based  computer system de virused , then about 30 min trying to figure out how to make windows let me down load the required programing software, then I looked at videos on you tube and was programing these baby's Likity split,  always get the proper cable from milklor, do not get the cheep cable seen on a-z,  etc.  the program you need is called chirp and you will need the daily build,  I'm using these for simplex in wilderness areas and to monitor co fire and rescue, and of course noaa weather. These  radios have the solid feel of professional equipment, some people complained about the chargers but mine worked perfectly, may be a upgrade."
1,Works great.. The app i have on my phone lets me see what is going  on with my truck real time.
1,Love it works great haven't had any trouble with it
1,"Adorable. My son bought this. It is so cute. However, since purchasing it a girl borrowed it and we haven;t seen it since. Ha, I guess she thought it was cute too."
1,"I love them, thanks so much!"
1,My second product from anker. Works real well. Had an issue with one of the ports but it turned out my cord needed to be replaced. Customer service was polite and quick to respond. No complaints here. Great product.
-1,"I don't know if it's a defect with mine, or what.<br /><br />I received this ask week. Just opened it now. The lighting cable doesn't stay in the actual port.<br /><br />I have 4 cables. None stay plugged in. So rare third party, some are Apple certified.<br /><br />My car has a lighting cable port. Doesn't stay plugged in there either.<br /><br />Another downside.<br />When I turn the battery on. My service cuts out. From full, to no service. Kinda disappointed in this."
0,Works great when it works but constantly having to reset it to keep a signal.
1,"Great simple, flexible, inexpensive shell case."
1,"Fits perfectly, feels really good, and the phone still feels slim. I would buy this item again."
1,Saved my phone
1,"would be nice if there was a secure loop to run a strap through, however the quality is good and the fit is snug."
-1,"Glass covered up the half the &#34;Home&#34; button. Did not match the phone at all.  ordered it right with the  case not sure how I ended up with the wrong one. Looked like heavy duty, but couldnt use it."
-1,I bought one for my Nikon d7200.  The glass was warped so there was a 3/4&#34; portion on one edge that would not lie down enough to seal to the screen.  (The glass was also a smidgen too small.)
1,"I recently bought a refurbished iPhone, which came without a charging cable. I got this one to use instead. I have to say that I am thoroughly happy with the cord. It fits the slot perfectly. I can &#34;find&#34; the phone by pulling on the cord, which I do as little as possible because I'm sure it's not great for the cord and/or the phone. The phone charges in just about the same amount of time as my daughter's iPhone, which came with the original manufacturer cable. The last reason why I am so happy over a simple cord is that it is the exact same color as my phone. I know that's a silly reason, but I have several items charging from that outlet, and having them color-coded makes life just a little easier.<br /><br />For those reasons, plus the fact that I see my little iPhone and its matching cable and it makes me smile, I give this five stars."
-1,loose case on iphone 5c . not snug. not going to risk it. will be returning
0,Its a nice phone just a little to many scratches and scuffs to my liking. But thats me
0,"Case fits like a glove which is good.  Buttons are okay to press, I'd give them a B- but im picky.  Really the two big things that bother me are the fact that theres a weird little jagged edge right at the micro USB port that rubs my pinky when I hold it and its annoying; and when I take the case off, 90% of the time it removes the back of the phone, too, which is also super annoying and i always feel like its gonna break.  Case is pretty slim and sleek providing little to no shock protection but good otherwise."
1,"This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I've ordered several of these cases in different colors for multiple phones and I love the kickstand function. I ordered this one to keep at work so I can see the notification light while working without keeping the volume up. I like to use other cases that don't have a kickstand, so I'll be able to snap this on at work and change back to my other case for the rest of the time. I was a little disappointed that they charged $5 for shipping, when the case didn't even cost me that much. That being said, even though it wasn't sent to me from Amazon/Prime, I did receive the case extremely quickly."
1,"These are honestly cheaper elsewhere with free shipping. We chose to buy these ones (I bought 3 different colors) because they looked like deeper colors, not so bright neon. Unfortunately that's just the picture used. They are just as bright neon as most, somewhat disappointing. The covers fit great, shipping was a little slower than most."
1,My reliable travel companion
1,useful accessroy in my car
-1,I rarely give bad reviews but I'm furious. I have iPhone 5s and this doesn't fit properly ! There are gaps on the corners and nod the home button doesn't work! My friend works at Apple and he does phone screens all day so it's not something he did. Do not buy this junk.
1,"Love this case!  I was looking to replace my wallet, as I hate carrying both in my line of work.  This case did the trick.  I carry 2 credit cards, my ID, some cash, and my phone.  All my rewards cards, etc. have been replaced by Android apps on my phone.  Convenient!  Love the magnetic strap that keeps it closed.  Seems like this case will last for a while.  Makes the phone significantly thicker when placing calls and having to hold to your ear, but if you use BT headset or speakerphone, it's not an issue at all. Even still, I have made many calls with it being in the case."
1,"Even though it's rubber and flexible, it fits like a glove and protects the iPod!"
0,I wish the tails would stay on better
1,This lil bluetooth was everything that I expected it to be.  It works well and paired quickly with my Galaxy Note 4. I mainly use it to listen to music while at work and it's great for that.  Battery life is about 2 hours and it recharges really quickly.  Call quality isn't great  but tolerable for short periods of time.  Bottom line this device is well worth the money.
1,Product works great. Just as promised.
1,"Phone case was packaged well, looks very nice and is proving to be durable. Great purchase"
1,Have this case on my s6 right now it has a very nice feel great texture not cheaply made! ♡♡ Love it
1,Works perfect
1,Daughter loves it!!! Very cute and sturdy. Great protection for her phone.
1,"Love this case. The fit is perfect and the back doesn't seem to scratch easily. The front lip keeps the screen off of whatever you place it on so you don't have to worry about taking advantage of the edge lighting. Easy to put on and remove, overall great case."
0,"Fits the iPhone 5/5s perfectly, but for some reason there's a small defect on the corner of mines. It caused a small air bubble/pocket to form. I cleaned my hands and applied the screen protector in a dust-free environment but it still happened."
1,Easy to put on. I like the look. Very sturdy
1,The quality is solid. Comes with a micro usb cables. Great!
1,It is a good product
1,"Got this as a present for my mom and she loves it! The soft rubber lining cushions the ipod while the hard case protects it from damage. It does not cover the screen but stays securely in place around the front border. Mine is different and only soft rubber and it slips off all the time. My next one will be just like this one! The color and print are still intact 3 months later. The holes line up perfectly with the usb port, ear bud port etc... It covers the volume buttons on the side with soft rubber so you can still easily press them without getting dirt in them. Overall its great! Mom did say it took a little work to put it on the ipod but she got it just fine. Great, cheap, pretty, durable ipod case!"
-1,Cheap quality and does not fit phone.
1,"Very heavy, nice pen, I like the laser pointer, the actual pen is not very high quality but looks nicer than a plastic pen without the high price. Perfect for business"
1,Excellent Thank You..
-1,Cracked in a week.
1,Fast shipping. Exactly as described.
1,"These headphones sounds great and don't fall out while at the gym. I have to use the medium size rubber inserts while my girlfriend used the smallest size. (The biggest size were too big.) My girlfriend loves the color. They are study since they are constructed mostly out of metal. The headphones themselves are on the larger side, they stick out of your ear a little. I suppose if you had very small ears it might look a bit weird, other than that I really like them.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review."
1,Purchased three for my kids.
1,Wonderful little speaker. I bought it for my wife's office and it is perfect. Easy set up and there have been no issues. Probably wouldn't use it as large room speaker but that is not what it's designed for.
1,Very happy with my selfie stick. Came on time and is perfect for my vacations!
-1,it didn't fit my phone
1,excellent
1,For this great product I received an amazing promo code and all I did was write an review
1,love
1,Love it!!
1,"This is exactly what I was looking for - A nice thin case that fits the iPhone perfectly.  My only complaint is that after about 4 months, it started to yellow a little - I loved how crystal clear it was at the start.  But at this price, I just purchased another and tossed the yellowed one out.  Perfect!"
1,"Good product, but sweating like crazy over the ears when working out,"
1,"I'm one of millions of people that constantly wonder why Apple, the inventor of all kinds of cool products, can't seem to make a power cord capable of lasting more than a few months.  Shame on you, Apple, because you could do better but you can't or won't.<br /><br />Now enter the Anker cord.  I originally bought another cord on Amazon which was a few dollars less.  Needless to say that cord barely worked at first and quickly died completely.  I then found Anker and have been very happy for the 3 weeks I've had it.<br /><br />Materials, design and quality all seem good.  Good value and product...  They could teach Apple a few things, I think!"
-1,Cheaply made... fragile not study.<br />You get what you pay for. Not recommended.....
1,Better than OEM.
1,Good
1,Great
1,Fits perfect. Fast shipping
1,Amazing phone!
-1,They worked for about a week.
1,"Quick delivery, stays on the phone great."
1,Great product.
-1,"I bought this mounting bracket for my Escort Passport 9500ix. It doesn't slide in smoothly into the radar, so every time I put in or take out my radar detector, it gives some trouble. Also the bracket looks like it's been painted recently, like it was a used bracket. Definitely not a recommendable OEM replacement mount. Still I manage to use it. At least it hasn't fallen off the windshield. I do sometimes have to press firmly against the suction cups because they loose some suction."
1,"Great protection for my phone. Ive dropped it a few times especially when getting out of my car, and still good. Easy to clean too."
1,"keeps the fone screen safe that's for sure ,,"
1,"A little hard to figure out how to put on the phone at first and really hard to get the phone out of the case once snapped in.  However, I have dropped my phone a few times (short distance) and the case and phone are just fine."
1,Really cute!
1,Nice perfect to use
1,"Would be five stars but when it gets hot it does stop working, once cooled off it works great."
-1,"Cheap and flimsy. Lightning end came off and stuck in my iPad, had to use tweezers to get it out.  Will never buy this brand again."
1,Excellent Thank You..
1,Worked as described at the waterpark.  We used them just yesterday and all phones were completely safe and the camera worked great too.
1,"Nicely made product, but a little small on the arm for my liking."
1,"Shipped quickly, very good quality.  Extra long cord makes it easy to use my device while it's charging.  My charging time is shortened a lot!  Highly recommend!!!"
0,"I like it, but def not as sturdy as my old case. But its fine. Only thing i really don't like is the stand part. Pia. You could break a nail getting it open,  i have fake nails, so its hard to get too. Sorry no one is going to carry around the guitar pic it came with."
-1,"This came with the stem mount for the RAM Mount I got for my motorcycle.<br /><br />While the mounting system from RAM Mounts is fantastic, this particular cell phone holder is a no go with the Iphone 6. It hits the volume or close button when in the proper position.<br /><br />It also has a wobble/rotation while in motion to the left and right.<br /><br />What I did to make it work was to purchase the QUAD LOCK system (universal mount with adhesive backing) and remove the arms and spring on this mount. I then stuck the QUAD LOCK onto it, and now I have a secure mount which fits onto my motorcycle, and I have purchased a Quad Lock for my car as well. Now it works fine.<br /><br />RAM has much better and more secure mounting solutions that are phone or device specific I suggest using those."
-1,"Good protection for the phone, But too big for a small person."
0,"After having this case for a few months,  the paint is chipping all over. I do like the case.  It isn't too bulky,  and I feel like my phone is protected.  I wouldn't buy another one."
1,My son loves these
-1,The add said of high quality and said it would incudle all mounting parts. I'm high dissatisfied
0,Nice cover for the back but doesn't do anything to protect the front.
1,"this glass cover is is great, it fits perfect and was a great buy.  mine went on as easy as you could expect.  the dealer got right out super fast.  I recommend this product and the dealer."
1,"[[VIDEOID:fcf2bdb3f1d37e2781470efc47fde6cc]]What a great leather wallet styled case!<br />It looks slim like a wallet style.<br />I easily inserted the phone into the case without a problem.<br />On the left flap, there are pockets to hold my driver license, credit card as well as some cash.<br />I can also use the case to stand my iPhone6. It is a quick and easy way to watch movie or do video chat.<br /><br />It looks great. My iphon6 is hidden well inside the case. Very cool!"
1,Love the case and the color match is perfect
-1,The sides to do close securely and pieces broke off after having it only 2 weeks.
1,Work great with the GPS on the bike and I would definitely buy from this company again
1,Excellent product
1,"It was exactly what I needed it to do! Be mobile and charge my phone at the same time! For me, it was the perfect length!"
1,"I received the book within 2 days, about 5 days earlier as estimated by shipper. Awesome job and thank you!!!<br />Gleim is one of the best study guides and test-prep on the market, at least in my eyes. I used Gleim 15 years ago for my PPL  and I bought this book to study for my up coming review, to brush up on new and updated information on the ground and in the air."
-1,"I was hoping for a dashcam that I could hide on my windshield, and have it record while the car was moving, hopefully saving me some grief and providing law enforcement with any evidence necessary should the time arise.<br /><br />Perhaps there is something wrong with my dashcam, but this really is not realistic for a number of reasons:<br /><br />1) the battery life is atrocious. Seriously, I would be surprised if this lasted for longer than an hour on a single charge. The 10 minute car ride to the store was enough to take out one of the three battery bars. This means that the dashcam needs to ALWAYS be plugged into the car charger. Even then, the rate of battery depletion is greater than the rate of charging. This results in tiny little recording loops, about 12-25 seconds each when the camera is on and plugged in.<br />2) One of the advertising points for this camera is the motion detector. I'm not actually sure if this works. While the camera does record when the car moves, again, the length of the looped segments seem compltely arbitraty, even at &#34;full&#34; charge. Is this because I was on the highway and there were few bumps in the road? What makes this even more aggravating is that the menu button doubles as an &#34;SOS&#34; button which will seemingly permanently record any recording that you made when you hit the SOS button. So while I am trying to reconfigure the settings so that the recording loop is longer, and so that more battery power is conserved, I inadvertently hit the SOS button. I now have at least 30 one seconds clips of my lap as a result of me trying to rework the settings, which brings me to my next point:<br />3) There aren't any instructions. Okay, that's not true. You get a bilingual sheet that does not help at all. For example, under the system settings section we have: &#34;5. Automatic video: Off/on&#34; What does that mean? Is that the automatic recording that I want? Is that to turn off the screen when the camera is rolling??<br /><br />There are other problems as well, such as the the date resetting itself. However, the main problem here is that I really can't depend on this camera is catch an accident.><br />There are other problems as well, such as the the date resetting itself.

1,Perfect!
1,Item was as expected and fast shipping
1,I live this tempered glass. Totally have my phone from damage!  Love it
1,Very easy to use and very comfortable. Use it with Bluetooth earbuds which makes it even easier to use. I would highly recommend this brand to anyone!
-1,"the bolt is not glued to the plastic, so the hold is wably/loose. i've owned one of these before. this one is clearly damaged."
1,Works great. Fast shipping.
-1,Disappointing. Brand new they last maybe eight hours. Admittedly i am on the phone a lot but the Samsung batteries lasted at least 24 hours when new. Ya get what you pay for.
1,Stays put beautifully. A great way to safely hold your cell phone.
1,Product is very good and satisfactory.<br /><br />This seller's items are always welcome.
1,Love the cover and the fact that it has a magnetic closure. Seems to hold up to wear and tear.
1,I got this for my mother and it's perfect it fits well and the pocket doesn't stretch and get loose like others it's just perfect for my mother
0,"It's a really cool case. I get compliments on it, but the two thin pieces by the lock and volume buttons broke within 4 days of normal use. Not too happy about that."
-1,"Had it for a week before it broke. There is a screw that holds the ball hinge to the strap.The ball hinge then is connected to the main part of the mount that holds the ipad. I had it mounted on the handlebars of my spin bike. When I moved my spin bike, I bumped the mount just slightly and that plastic surrounding the screw snapped.<br /><br />Returning the product and will look for other options."
1,Perfect to take on a road trip
1,"I was a little worried about the installation of the glass screen protector, this is my first one.<br />Actually seemed quite a bit easier than the plastic ones I'm used to installing<br />and it feels phenomenal to the touch, so much better than plastic."
1,"been using this charger in my car for a month now.  I constantly charge a galaxy s6 using gps, an iphone6, a Bluetooth streaming device, and sometimes an iPad. The unit performs perfectly!  I also bought anker 6ft usb to hide my cables. Again anker comes though"
0,"Nothing special, average quality, normal functionality."
-1,Great at first but didn't take long for the rubber to come that holds the phone in the clamps
1,Great Case for the price!!!
1,"The iPhone 4s products come just as described,thank you!"
1,"I had so hoped these would be great, but they weren't.  Out of five I had two that worked occasionally.  You would plug it in it would say it was charging, look at it five minutes later and it would say not charging. Kept trying them for a few days, but pattern continued. Finally gave up and bought some cords that aren't  pretty, but they do work."
-1,"These fit fine, and we were able to finally get all the bubbles out, however, there's a sticker on the front of the screen protector and when you peel it off, it leaves sticky residue that we tried really hard to get off. We tried 3 protectors and over an hour of trying to clean it off but it was still sticky and discolored in those areas. We ended up having to peel the covers off so it was a waste of money. The product was cheap but I wish we hadn't wasted multiple dollars on shipping for something so useless."
1,works perfect
0,"Feels like my phone is truly protected in this case.  Unfortunately, the stand seems poorly designed and broke the first day I had it, causing it to no longer stay folded into place.  It still functions as a stand when I need it, but I have just taken the stand off due to the inconvenience it causes by not staying put away."
-1,Bad material!
1,Not too shabby.
1,Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you.
1,"Perfect, not too long, not too short. The suction works as advertised. The bottom fold out piece is not even necessary, as the clamps hold my LG G3 just fine as is. And I see that as a plus, because otherwise I'd have to fiddle with the charger cord a little since the charging port is on the bottom. Though there is an opening in the bottom piece, so a cord can go through it."
0,"It was a great cover, but got dirty looking rather quick."
-1,very uncomfortable and people have a hard time hearing you. Would never buy this again. Save your money for some LG pros that you wear around your neck. Those are awesome!
-1,The product was broken after a week of use!
1,great product!
1,"While it adds a bit of bulk to the grip of the phone, it certainly does what it was intended to do: protect the device when dropped."
1,Never had a waterproof case.  Taking a little bit to get used to.  Great coverage for the phone.  My only complaint is I thought there would be more grip on the sides.
1,"It makes the cell phone more bigger in all dimensions. And does not sport a stand at the back. If you keep aside these, in my account, drawbacks the case is a good protection and serves the purpose."
1,Good timing and great quality
1,Super sturdy. Has a screen protector built in. Plugs the charge and ear bud holes
0,Not bad
1,This works perfect with both my Nokia Lumia and my wife's Samsung Note 5. So I bought another and it also works perfect.
1,"Very nice quality, slim profile phone wallet.  Great to carry with you when you need to make a quick run to pick up the kids or go to the grocery store.  Description is very accurate.  Fits I-Phone 6 perfectly.  Can easily hold two credit cards, driver's license, and dollar bills.  The wrist lanyard is an added plus.  Case appears to adequately protect I-Phone. Love the magnetic closure securing contents inside. I am definitely pleased with this item.  I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
-1,"The phone was damaged, although advertised as &#34;In mint condition&#34;. The sound up and down button did not work,and the phone does not show how much charge there is, dies without warning. I paid premium for this piece of junk, was not returnable because I had opened it and by the time, my son , for whom I bought it became aware of the problems, it was over a month."
1,"Had an issue with my first shipped item and messaged the sender. With no hesitation they sent me a replacement and it works perfectly, my phone charges great and it was a very easy install. Highly suggest buying this product!"
1,Works Well.
1,Perfect!
1,Love this case.  It was just what I was looking for and much less expensive than the Sprint store...about 1/4 the cost!
1,Amazing
1,First screen protector that I've brought and put on myself. Delivery was fast and the product was packaged well. The screen protector came with instructions and it was simple to apply to my new Note 5.
0,"This product is a bit complicated to open, and close everytime I use it. The face piece and bottom plate snap together unlike the previous one I had that slide together and snap in the middle. I wish I knew that before I purchased. The usage of this product is simple, and it works however I expected more for the price I paid. It sometimes makes a loud buzzing noise, and the speakers are muffled because of the case. Product can be designed better, but it works."
-1,This was advertised to operate with a Doro 410 phone. The plug does not fit. Also the picture shown here is not what I ordered or received.
1,good case overall
-1,Got it in the mail and won't charge my phone
1,Great product with amazing customer service.Will continue to buy  Anker products.
1,These cords are very durable feeling. They seem better constructed then the actual apple cord and because they are certified I do not get an annoying message when plugging in. Bought these to replace my APPLE product cords that didn't even last a year.
1,I bought this for my son and he says it works great. I also bought one for my granddaughter and she loves hers too. She made a point to tell me about taking it on a trip with her where she knew she wouldn't be able to charge her phone.
1,best
1,good phone
0,"A lot larger than I was expecting. hard to close the case, at one point I felt like I was going to break it."
1,"Working as advertised, great buy"
1,Nice cover
0,"Didn't consider how awkward it would be to use the camera and landscape mode with it. And now the &#34;hinge&#34; is getting weak and thin. I think it will start to tear soon. Otherwise I like the case, works and looks cool."
1,I bought it for my husband and he loves it!
-1,Had it for 4 months and it is now broken. Has not been misused. Shoddy product. Not worth any money
-1,Bought 2 and they both failed after 4 months.
-1,"If you want to cut down on your mobile phone usage, this is the phone for you.  Set up is simple - but make sure not to slip into accessibility mode or all the buttons become unresponsive.  The menu (needed to undo this) is cleverly hidden (hold down the bottom right button for long enough - but you may find this tricky in accessibility mode).  In this mode the phone can also lock you out completely with the easy solution of a hard reset - make sure to delete the backup of everything you have managed to install before doing that.  Switching between 4G and 3G networks is not a problem (the phone seems to have trouble doing this on its own) - just go 3 levels down into that hidden menu and change from CDMA / LTE mode to CDMA mode (you knew what those stood for didn't you?).  Then there is the the way they have pre-installed a bunch of apps you do not want and made them hard to remove.  This ensures that you have at least space for 4 medium sized apps that you do want.  Add to this that within weeks this phone got stuck in headphone mode.  What a great (if expensive) paper weight this phone makes."
1,Two cute pink elephant bookends. Great for a child's room and look better than the generic black metal bookends that can be purchased anywhere.  I gave the product 4 stars because it wasn't wrapped that well for shipping and the bookends were bent slightly inwards. I gently bent them to a 90 degree angle without any damage. Expect shipping to take 2-3 weeks as they product comes directly from China.
0,Works great for iphone 5s. Clip is very difficult to open for any phone thats a bit larger (galaxy s5 or even iphone 6)
1,"I received a product discount for a fair review.  Great product, protects phone well!"
-1,"Barely fits the phone, seems to loose. The stylus is hard to get at and for most audio jack applications the case needs to be removed."
1,Phone fits perfectly and it's really nice having my Drivers Licenses and Debit card with me at all times!
1,"Affordable price. Comfy. This is my second pair. Loved the color. This time I received a discount for reviewing the product. However, it is a well deserved review."
1,I am very satisfied with my order. Nice case for my tablet.
0,Worked great at first but both of these cords are now kaput with normal use.
-1,well i give a poor rating just because it did not adjust the output voltage at all... turning the pot screw
1,My daughter loved it and received many compliments. Product is made well for the price!
1,"Nice clean eazy to read, able to hear, good clear volume."
1,Good for the price/minutes
1,Excellent
1,I love it
1,"Found it to be just what I wanted...comfortable, easy to put on, grips well, and kept my phone sweat-free."
1,"Got this for my son's phone.  The design print is good, and the case is well made.  Warning: once the case goes on, it does not come off easily.  This is good, as it means that it should stay attached during a drop to the ground.<br /><br />We did have to trip some of the plastic away from the inner edge of the screen side as it was pressing on his glass screen protector and causing it to lift.  Simple fix, and won't be an issue if you don't have a glass screen protector."
1,excellent product only bad thing is the camera resolution
1,"Holds strong on the dash, and shows no signs of coming off when hitting bumps in the road. I've been using this for over a year now and it works as intended. Great to be able to adjust the view in both portrait and landscape mode when using the phone for navigation.<br /><br />Great product. Ships fast and works as intended. 5 stars."
-1,Not original...it's a copy
1,Please with the product.  Dropped the phone a few times and it has withheld the drop and kick test.  Great!
1,Exelent
1,"Easy to install, good sound quality. The SD card is a nice feature (I was able to move my songs from my Garmin GPS)."
1,Fit my phone well.  The shipping was fast and the price was more than reasonable.  Would highly recommend for a low cost option to protect your phone.
1,Good product. Immersize.<br /><br />-1 star because it hurts the bridge of your nose.
0,The belt clip broke after a couple of weeks using it.  Weak point is where the metal pin goes through the plastic ears.
1,good
1,"I love this case! Can't beat the price, and it's one of the thinnest iPhone cases I've found. It's not protective, but that's not what I was looking for in a case. If you want something thin, lightweight, and flexible, this is the case for you.<br />It also came with a screen protector. I don't use them, but I thought it was nice, especially since the case was only $6.<br /><br />Another nice touch: it has flaps that cover the charging port and headphone jack. This case feels well made and not cheap at all.<br /><br />Again, it's NOT meant to be a protective case, but it is an amazing decorative case!"
1,Works great
1,earpiece is ok but the clip that goes around your ear stinks. it only comes with 2 clips and they both broke i've only had this unit for a month. i do remove it from my ear everyday and i would think the clips would be more flexable.
1,I have about a 75% success rate in opening bottles. the cigarette lighter kind of worked once but I haven't been able to recharge it. its a little bulky but I do like how it looks.
1,Sound great and stay put! :-D
1,"Was a tad loose, but otherwise live it"
1,Still have my otter box. I have dropped my phone several times. I have even stepped on my phone and there has been no damage thanks to this otter box. I only wish I had not have gotten white though.. it stains easily.
-1,These cords Worked for about 3 days then said &#34;not compatible with iPhone&#34; and haven't worked since then. Great size and cute but won't work with iPhone so they don't do me any good.
1,I love this item. So safe and sturdy.
1,"You can never have too many USB cables... and with different lengths this is an awesome pack. We used the longer cable in the car, the rest are used to charge a bunch of tablets and phones."
1,I was very happy with my purchases! !
-1,I am very disappointed.  worst experience ever.
-1,Doesn't work. Plugged in a light came on and then went out. Did not charge my phone. Junk
1,"It works great.  After shopping around, this was not only a quality product, but priced better.  Excellent bargain for excellent product."
1,Used it for a week with no other electricity. Worked as it should.<br />A pocket underneath would be great so the phone & charging battery could be tucked away during charge.
1,Good product but no instructions for installing screen protector.
1,"Once I figured out how to set the device to random, I very much have enjoyed it. It works very well, though the &#34;random play&#34; setting does tend to pick the same songs with some consistency. Certainly, it has been a relief to not have to worry about cds sliding on to the floor and getting scratched. I think it is a good buy for the price."
1,"I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....<br /><br />This is my first time using a Qi Wireless Charger, PLESON Ultra-Slim Qi Wireless Charging Station. I just got a galaxy S6. It is compatible with this wireless charger. This is so easy to use. You just set your phone on top and make sure the connection was made. You'll know it's charging when the indicator light on the front is blinking. I like that you can charge a variety of different electronics. I have 5 people in my household that all have smartphones.  The pad itself is sturdy and small. It has a rubber piece on top to make sure the phone doesn't slide off. Although it did not charge my phone as fast as it normally would when it's plugged in, but it did get the job done"
-1,Wrong battery
-1,"Mophie chargers are excellent but this case is not.  I've owned two and in each case, the plastic belt clip has broken after a month or so of very normal use, dropping the phone to the floor in each instance.  The first instance was a few years ago and I foolishly assumed that this product would have been improved and bought a second one.  My mistake.  The shortcomings of the plastic fittings make this product unworthy of your purchase."
1,Great price for a great product. I was worried about the thickness of a glass screen protector but the beveled edge makes this screen protector a must on all my future phones.
1,"This is a very clever and handy way to hold my smart phone onto the steering wheel. I tend to hang out in the car and watch utube videos on the phone and this fits and holds my LG G4 phone perfectly. It's a bit of a stretch to get it over the edges, but it holds it securely. And the fact that the phone can be turned either upright or horizontally is great."
1,Protects my screen as described :) It's easy to apply if you follow the directions (just make sure you align it correctly because you can't lift it off if it settles). Also fits with a case which is a nice. Now I can throw my phone in my purse without worrying about the screen getting scratched.
1,I originally ordered a milti pack and really was happy.  But most recently the 6 foot no longer makes a tight fit and I have to play with it to get it to charge.  sometimes I get up in the morning and my phone is dead because it quit charging during the night. I will need to contact them and get another.  but overall they have worked fine.
1,Good qualities and a great seller.
0,May have given it a 5 but so far no one here can figure out how to open it to put the phone in it. It didn't come with any instructions other than the printing in the back of the package that talks about the underwater capabilities!!!
1,excellent product!
-1,"Absolutely horrible. This case is WAY too big for my S6. I can't access the volume or sleep buttons at all. On top of that, the ears aren't attached. Both of them fell off in my hand when I out the case on my phone."
1,I have so many cords running every where when I try to charge something it becomes a hassle! Well with this 5 port charger I can keep things a bit more organized! I put the fat square bread ties around the cord and then plug it in and then I know what is what. This charger helps me keep everything a bit more organized and charges super fast! I did receive this for an honest unbias review. Over all I am super happy with this charger.
1,I love how long this cable is it is way longer than the cable apple provides you with the iphone and ipad and its cheeper but its still a good quality cable. If you need a longer lightning to usb cable I highly recommend this one.
-1,I order 3 and only 2 worked.  The one we kept only works on one iphone
1,Was just as expected. Came in a timely manner
1,"I really like the case and the duel layer. I wish there was slightly more rubber on the corners, but it fits very nicely and is relatively easy to take apart."
1,"Very good alternative to having to install Bluetooth in your car or truck. Especially since you can choose literally any station. However it would be nice if it had an external Antena because there is a constant static in the background unless you have the transmitter in the right position. Other than that, great product for the price!"
1,"I absolutely loved this case! I got a lot of compliments on it and even though it's slim, it protected my phone when it fell."
1,Product arrived as advertised and I love it.  Deliver was as promised.
1,"The case is great, I especially enjoy the kickstand on the back."
1,"Great battery case! Better than Mophie. Bought 2, one for me and my wife and we both have never run out of power ever!"
1,Great
1,Love the case
1,Not real wood. But. Real wood would not last. Awesome look case and deal. Screen protector and stylus handy too
1,"I love this phone holder for my car!  I got this one and the shorter one, and I love them both.  Instead of keeping your phone in your pocket or in your bag/purse when you get in the car, put it on this phone holder.  It is so much more convenient!  The taller one is more flexible in it's use because of it's multiple adjustment settings.  It turns left, it turns right, it swivels around, so you can custom fit it for your personal preference.  It is very sturdy and very convenient.  I always keep my phone in my phone holder while driving because I'm directionally challenged so I'm always on my GPS.  This phone holder is great because it sits high, so I can look at my GPS and keep an eyes on the road.  It has adjustable EVERYTHING so it will basically fit in any car cup holder.  The workmanship on this is superior to other phone holders I have used in the past.  It isn't very bulky either so it doesn't really get in the way of anything else.  This is a great product for anyone that pretty much has a phone and a car."
1,pretty
-1,Poor design and implementation. AVOID buying. Weak voice recognition. It usually gets it wrong. Navigation screens confusing. Updates far and few between. Newest map is six months old before it is issued and already 1 year out of date. Outdone by a $40 TomTom
1,It was the  best.thanks
1,We've had it for a month and so far seems to work as described.  Can get  4-5 phone charges out of it.
1,Love it
-1,This case didn't even fit it was so bad
1,Great
-1,Same issue other people are having...the top snapped right off first time using. Returning it today!
-1,Verizon services sucks because I have had the service a week and already My 4 G is already gone on 1 device.
1,I recieved a discount on my order for a fair review
1,"I have used this dash camera for several months , it stll works well. that is the point I am here to write a reveiw after several months . the resoution is good to me .Day or night version  is acceptable , you can see clearly what happed in front of your car and other car license number  as the price and quality , I do not think other camera is better than this pc. I have bought GS8000 as before , but after 15 days when i used , I shipped back to amazon , the quality is disastering , the screen always get blank then you can do nothing . love this pc and reconmend it to my other family."
1,Thinner than other cases I have used.  Materials seem to be high quality.  it feels really good in my hand holding the phone.  The fit is excellent.  I tried my remote function for the TV and it worked fine.
1,great
-1,I have an iPhone 5s carrier lock was sprint It did not work I ended up just pay more money for an unlock that did work
1,"Fits well, seems lie it will hold up better than some of the other cases for the old Xperia. The back of the case is better quality than some of the more flimsy cases we have tried. The case doesn't block the camera like many of the other Xperia cases do."
1,"It works well, and I like this. It makes for me to handle easily in the car."
1,Work great.  Stay on well.
1,This is a pretty good portable backup battery pack for the money. It charges relatively fast and it charges my phone well. I can get one complete charge for my phone out of it.
1,"This is a great looking cell phone case, but it`s more for a woman than a  man. That`s the only reason I couldn`t use it, otherwise it is made well."
1,"I LOVE THIS! Great little wallet. I don't like to carry a purse, so this suits me perfectly."
1,"Purchased for my Note 5. In fact I bought to of them, different colors because of the price. Fits the phone well and feels good in your hands. It is a thin case so I do not how well it protects the since I am very carefully with the phone. This is not an otterbox but I did not expect it to be that much protection. I like the style and the fit, easy to get on but a little difficult to get off, but that is ok if you don't take it off and on alot. Would be this again for my wife's phone when she is ready to upgrade."
1,"I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 with Android version 4.4.2. It states the Bluetooth works with Android version 4.2.2 and above and mine works perfectly with it. When I was contacted by the company to receive this item for my honest review the first thing I did was make sure my Android version would work.<br /><br />This is my first selfie stick. First I put on the included USB charger but it was actually already completely charged. It's 7 1/2&#34; long closed and about 30&#34; fully extended. By pressing the Bluetooth button on the end (where the logo &#34;gogogu&#34; is) it paired easily with my phone; it shows up as Z07-5 on my phone and shows the message &#34;bluetooth keyboard connected&#34; when paired.<br /><br />I extended the stick, put my phone in the slot and used the thumb screw to tighten it so it would stay. Then I started taking selfies by pressing the Bluetooth button; it was that easy. I know you don't want to see selfies of me (I don't blame you; I don't either), so I'm posting a couple selfies that Mickey & Minnie took (with a little help from their friend). What a fun device!  :-)"
1,Love the color
-1,"Do not buy this head unit.  You will HATE it.<br /><br />Pros: Sound quality is great.  Connectivity is very good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It has a HORRIBLE user interface.  No preset buttons, menus upon redundant menus. It's terrible when you're parked, so good luck trying to make it work how you want while driving.<br />2. It has abysmal build quality.  Like others have mentioned, it randomly decides to stay on every once in a while even when you remove the key to the vehicle, and you either have to disconnect the battery or the fuse to shut it down.  It freezes CONSTANTLY.  It reboots itself for no reason.  Oh, and my favorite: every single time you first touch the volume nob or buttons to change your station upon initially powering on the unit, it crashes the face display and has to restart itself.<br />3. No preset buttons.  Everything has to be done through a left/right button.  That design decision makes zero sense whatsoever.<br />4. Curved display reflects sunlight at any angle.<br />5. And while we're talking about the display, it is absolutely horrendous.  The worst--the ABSOLUTE WORST--display I have EVER had in a piece of car audio equipment.  Completely and utterly unreadable in sunlight.  So now, while driving, you have a unit with no dedicated preset buttons causing you to scroll through channels you can't see.  THANKS A LOT, KENWOOD.<br /><br />This head unit is terrible.  Do not buy it.  Does it sound great?  Sure.  But that is NOT worth it these days with so many other great options to purchase.  It crashes, it's frustrating to use, and even when it works flawlessly, the display is completely useless."
1,"[[VIDEOID:e8181b266aea9bc5006b93fba5078b2c]] This is a great little speaker. It has a rubber casing to protect it from bumps because you will be taking this on the go. There is an included carabeaner clip to attach take it wherever you go: to the park, to school,  to the beach. Included with the speaker is a micro USB charging cable and a 3.5 mm audio cable if you aren't using bluetooth. On the back is a rubber covering protecting ports to charge, 3.5 audio port, and the on/off switch) The top has clear buttons to pair the device, play/pause/answer calls, Volume Up/down/skip song forward/back. Whats neat is that this also included an LED flashlight. I can see myself taking this camping just to do double duty.<br /><br />Sound wise it gets loud and clear with crisp highs but not much in the way of a lower range. I don't expect that from a speaker of this size but its worth noting. Bluetooth range is typical for a device like this at about 30 feet in open air.

0,"The case fits the phone snug and looks as it appears in the image. My only issues with it are that there is hardly any protective lip space in the front to protect the phone in case of accidental face drops, and the kickstand is simply a thin plastic material. This case is solid enough though for simple drops. It's good mostly for the aesthetic appeal."
1,I love this color and the brushed metal feel. However I found that it seemed to block my streetpass abilities somewhat.
1,great ipod cover
1,"If you have a GoPro and any accessories you NEED a case to keep all of your stuff in the same place. From all of cases which I've seen and tried, this one is highly recommended."
1,Everything was perfect
1,Cool
-1,"I tried this for the first time today.  First, it is impossible to access the screen in any useful way when using this.  That is because it goes on the side of your arm where most people can't see clearly.  Second, the plastic cover continuously hit different parts of the screen and kept launching apps and changing screens unintended.  It was a huge disappointment.  On my way out of the gym today I threw this thing in the trash.  It's useless.  Pockets work better."
0,"First off, the seller was Great. Item arrived in a very timely manner. The actual materials of this 3 piece case appear to be very rugged. The only exception might be the belt clip (time will tell). However, once you put the silicone gel around the phone, then proceed to slide the phone into the middle bracing part, you have no way to avoid putting stress on the volume rocker and power buttons. You just have to work those buttons into the cutouts. If, like me, you choose to use the belt clip case, inserting and removing the phone can be a challenge. At first, I found myself accidentally taking screen shots because of the pressure being put on the power and volume rocker buttons while sliding the phone in and out of the belt clip case (very tight). Plus the gel covering tends to fold up when pulling phone out. The solution? Well, this is a &#34;flip screen phone,&#34; so I just put it into the belt clip case right side up even though I would rather put it in right side down (The reason: hand down at side to hand up at ear. Results when I pull the phone out, the phone goes from right side down in case to right side up at ear). Overall Pros: 1) Material used appear to be very durable. 2) Kickstand seems to work very well. Overall Cons: 1) Phone is tight in belt clip. 2) Silicone gel gets a lot of friction when putting in and pulling out of belt clip case. 3) Although silicone gel cover has some notches on the sides, feels a little slick."
1,Works fine for charging my LG Tracfone in the car. You can't beat this price and speedy delivery.
1,Great product!
1,nice and good price
1,"The cable works as advertised and feels sturdy and well made.<br /><br />I've removed one star because, like most short cables, it is more expensive than it ought to be.  I can justify the additional expense because I appreciate having a short cable in my travel kit.  I use mine in conjunction with an external HDD enclosure and the product has worked reliably."
1,"I couldn't be happier with this case. It is very sturdy and I'm always getting compliments on it. I'm able to keep my license, 2 credit cards and a couple of dollars in it. Now I don't have to carry my purse everywhere."
-1,It quit working after 44 days. Do not waste your money.
1,"good value, fast shipping!  Hard outer case has good feel...kick stand quality reflects the price"
1,"Quick shipping.  Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but looks like it is just what I needed and at a great price."
1,As awesome as one can plainly see from the picture and arrived sooner than estimated.
0,"Once i installed it and let it sit and dry over night, I found that the screen had a small blurry spots i guess from where the spray dried that really bothered me so i took it off. Other than that it fit perfect even stayed in place on the curves."
1,A++++
1,Love this product.'
1,Slim. Convenient. Easy to use.
0,I was a little disappointed with the quality of the leather. It feels like cardboard. I was hoping to get some nice soft quality leather. Maybe it will soften up once it breaks in.
1,Nice to have an after-market product that works and does not carry the heavy price tag of the name brand.
1,fit exactly.  Excep tthe magnet was not very strong.
1,Great product. All my friends have on just got my code getting mine.
1,My friend's phone is as good as new.  This repair isn't for the timid but if you're not afraid of small parts and you're careful about keeping track of what screw goes where this is an easy way to make someone very happy.<br /><br />I just wish it were cheaper.  The part for a comparable-age iPhone is less than half as much.
1,Fit great! Looks factory
0,"I bought it for $15.99 and for that price I would say it is OK.  I have set it up to recharge an external 6Amp\hr battery pack, it takes about two full sunny days to recharge this pack when it is completely depleted. I use the battery pack to recharge my other stuff. The reason I use it that way is because it does not really want to charge my phone or other 5V items directly ( they always seem to disconnect and then reconnect and do not really charge). The battery pack does not seem to mind and even looks to be partially recharging on somewhat cloudy days.  The case is pretty nice since it folds into a very pack-able size and will fit into a day pack without wasting a lot of space.  The only thing I do not like is that the material the case is made from definitely is not protected from U.V.  I have had the solar panel outside recharging for about 7 days and the material of the jacket is changing colors to a somewhat purple color I can only imagine this will not last for more than a couple of months of charging use before the material degrades to the point of falling apart."
1,"Very slim, preserves iPhone 6 design. Texture has just the right amount of grip - it doesn't slip but you don't have a struggle pulling it out of your pocket either.  Altogether very nice"
-1,The speakers did not sound as well as I thought they would because they were jbls. The highs could be a little bit more crispier sounding.
1,Item exactly as described and arrived on time
1,Works great
-1,It look fancy and I did like it when I received it but after not even two weeks the magnet not working anymore I can close the case
1,"Perfect for &#34;no pockets&#34; outfits and outdoor activities, really is waterproof!"
1,Exactly what I expected.  Easy to install.
1,Great
1,This charger works awesome. I have a Galaxy s6 with an Otter Box. It charges a little slower than the wall charger that came with the phone but more than adequate. It's really not super picky about how the phone is positioned  but the light will flash red/green immediately if it's not happy with where you put it. The charger is pretty small... smaller than I expected which is a plus. I haven't measured but I'd say about 2.5-3&#34; across the widest point. It has a nice rubbery top and bottom so it won't slide around and the light is tiny and not crazy bright as I've read about other similar chargers (ie. Lighthouse in my bedroom etc...). It charges until full and then trickle charges to keep you at 100%. Overall I'm very happy after a couple weeks of use and i would highly recommend this product as a great bargain and well thought out design.
-1,"it does not work! I tried it in 3 different cars and cannot use on any small appliance (shaver, CD player, etc.)"
0,Its a $50 phone enough said. It does its job.
1,I love t
1,exelent
1,"This little charger has been so convenient to have. Most chargers with multiple ports don't have enough Watts and Amps to properly power all the ports if you use them all at once. They can usually just power a few low power devices and only one high power device. However, the Swees 50 Watts 5V / 10A 5 Port USB Charger can power 4 ports at 2.4A if you need it. It can also power all 5 ports with 2A of power, which is more than sufficient for smart phones and tablets, or whatever else you need to charge via USB power.<br /><br />It's small, compact, and sturdy metal frame design. it's also lightweight, so it won't weigh you down while travelling. However, the light weight can also be an issue if you want it to stay in place on your desk or night stand. I ended up putting some Velcro on one side to keep it from moving around so much."
1,Sweet!
-1,"Purchased on Aug. 10 and As of today, Aug. 31 it has multiple scratches and is actually cracked across one corner. I have not and do not abuse my phone(s). This protector has been on since I put the phone in the Otterbox Defender case and yet it is damaged. It was easy to put on, gave good coverage on the phone's glass and it felt really good when using it."
1,Very good product. Sturdy and looking good (the red color looks better than the black one). I feel my iPhone is well protected in this case.
1,The device is good. I like it.
-1,Disappointed that a screw popped out during first use. It still works but I would order another brand.
1,Works great though there are times when the phone comes off the charger without a complete charge.
1,Fits snug! I really like the look and feel of this case. Light weight. Delivered way ahead of delivery date.
1,Fit as expected.
1,Was amazing simple to program too!
1,Works great! Been using a couple weeks now and nice and clear!
-1,"The clip on the side that attaches it to the iPhone broke after a few weeks of use.  I had to use a rubber band to hold it in the case, but that had to be removed to use the phone.  I finally discarded it."
1,"i've only used this cable for a couple of days but so far it works great, no problems"
1,"Nice battery, but I'm returning it because the product dimensions are incorrectly listed (as of 8/31/15). It is listed as being the same size as the Astro E5 2nd Gen, but it is significantly longer than the E5. The upgraded matte finish is cool but it's more slippery than the piano finish on the E5. It doesn't have a flashlight like the E5 and the battery lights don't stay on very long when you check the battery strength, whereas on the E5 the battery meter would remain lit up for about 30 seconds."
-1,broke a couple weeks after installing.
1,love it...
-1,"Product did do it's job, it protected my screen, I yogurt for sure it'd last more thanone"
1,I live it. Just what I expected. Came sooner then expected😊
1,Great product and great price!
1,The 10 foot charging cord is so useful because you can charge your phone from anywhere in the room.  The only reason this isn't a 5-star rating is that you get what you pay for; these cords usually stop working after a couple months.
1,"Ordered this sub enclosure as I really wanted some bass in my pick up.  It's a DVC SUB factory wired @ 2 Ohm's so I took the sub out and wired to 8 Ohm as my amp is not 2 ohm stable.  Really impressed with the sub, thought was a little flimsy sub in the enclosure. But the weight of the actual sub-woofer that contributes to 85% of the enclosure weight.  Have this little fella installed in my 1990 single cab Toyota Hilux (Pickup)  Hooked up to a old school Rockford Punch 60.2 bridged; @ 14.7 volts 280 Watts!  Perfect fit behind the seat...seat all the way back too! Give's a real nice bass too...not the awful boomy bass.  Good bass that's low!  Need now to upgrade my high end to perfect balance."
0,I really like the case but the color is not like picture.  Speedy shipping.
1,very good
1,Great product.  Works great for a great price.
1,"i make a video with my aquarium, fanastic really, buy it!"
1,"If you follow directions, it's quite easy to install.  Very clear, and works great!"
1,"An excellent product , marked it easy to hold this phone without hurting your fingers"
1,Case does everything as advertised. Just a little larger than I thought. A great way to protect my phone while on my boat.
1,Fits great easy to adjust bends when I do depending on what exercise I teach.
-1,Broke after a few days
1,Works aspected. Great
1,Works great.

1,"I do own a few car charges; some I enjoy better than others but for the most part, they have done their jobs with no problems. I opted in for this 4 Port USB Car Charger by Celltronix because I own another one of their products and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />This 4 Port Charger arrived packaged well without any damages visible. It looked exactly as the advertised pictures so there were no unexpected surprises on my end.<br /><br />So what gives this 4 Port USB Car Charger a different look is the way the USB connection ports are placed!! Instead of a really long and bulky looking charger, the 4 ports are placed on both sides of the head. So I no longer have to worry about charger cords protruding from the top. That was an instant plus for me!<br /><br />I took this 4 Port USB Charger right away to my car and put it in use. The power indicator light showed up instantly when I turned the car on. Before I connected my iPhone and iPad, I connected my charger cables to be sure the product would not get hot during use. My results were negative so I proceeded to connect my iPhone and iPad with instant charging success.<br /><br />Overall as of now, I have had no problems with this device and I have no complaints. I think it is well designed and made. I really am looking forward to long-term use from it.<br /><br />I was selected to review this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
-1,"I bought it for my wife's iphone sometime last year. Looks really nice. But after couple of months it stopped working without any reason. My wife didn't even use it that often, she usually charges her phone at home.<br />It was wastage of money.<br />Will definitely NOT recommend."
1,Amazing!! Work great
1,"I really like this product for charging several devices at once: iPhone, Kindle HD and Kindle reader.  I've tried other products similar to this that would not charge or were very slow.  This one does the job. I've very pleased."
-1,My phone wouldn't fit properly even though I bought it for the iPhone 5. The bottom piece to cover the charging port broke in about 2 days.<br />Do not waste your time on this product!
1,Works fine. Havent had it long so will see how it holds up. I love the long cord. I use it on an older ipad i have.
-1,"seriously, save your money! It works great, but doesn't work with My Fitness Pal or phone therefore the number of steps you don't transfer over and I ended up with 4 different apps which I just wanted one app to do everything. Get the FitBit Zip, more money but worth it!"
1,good product
1,"I received a product discount for a fair review.  Good product, very sturdy and well made"
-1,"Rubbish! Lenses are blurry, they don't fit right, cheap garbage... arg!"
1,"I purchased these headphones for my 2.75 year old for a airplane trip. The things I was looking for were: comfort, volume control, durability, connectivity to another pair (I also have a 5 year old). Lil Gadgets headphones fit the bill exactly. I read many reviews of headphones for children & was torn between cutesy character ones that I knew my kids would love and more simple designed ones like these. In all the reviews I read comfort & volume were big issues. I decided any headphones I purchased must have padding at the top so the kids could wear them without discomfort. The ability to connect the headphones without a splitter is genius. The simplicity of the design makes them a joy to use. I read other reviews of this product which people said the volume was too low and their kids could not use them on the airplane. I did NOT find this to be true at all. My kids could hear perfectly well, and we were even seated next to the wing. Overall my kids LOVE these headphones, had no problem wearing them for extended periods, the fact that they fold into themselves also makes travel easier and more compact, the kids were able to hear fine & are excited to use them on trips now. In the end the fact that they are simple, no crazy color or designs were a plus, they look just like my husbands so the kids feel very grown up when they use these. The cord is fantastic, it's like a shoelace material & I can tell they will last longer with this design. I also like the fact they each come with their own dust bag (makes it so much easier to travel and carry around) If you are looking for children's headphones, these are superior to any others you will find for this price point. I highly recommend these headphones for toddlers and young children!"
-1,Piece of crap.  Just for decoration.
-1,"1) My Galaxy S4 does NOT fit the product.  My phone is too small, and falls out.  This seems like it was designed for an S5 to be honest.  So either I got the wrong model, or this thing is poorly designed.<br /><br />2) The way the main holder connects to the mount makes it wiggle and shake when pressing the touchscreen on the phone.  The entire thing wiggles a few cm each time.<br /><br />3) The coiled cord may SEEM nice... but it really is just in the way most of the time.  I would rather have a long straight cord I could route properly around the top of the windshield and around to where the cable plugs in."
-1,"After second use, it would not turn off. After letting the battery. drain, it would not turn on or light up when charging. I tried a new charger and nothing changed."
0,"When I ordered this I thought is was a completely enclosed case.  I was disappointed that the front of the case does not have a protective cover and I still have to use the screen savers/protectors. The following description led me to believe this case enclosed the iPhone completely: &#34;Delivers instant all around protection from scratches Constructed from smooth, treated rubber that resists dirt and stains TPU, also known as thermoplastic polyurethane, is more cut and tear resistance over rubber. It is abrasion resistance, and has a high degree of transparency.&#34;  This was found on http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LL1LFUG?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0"
1,"I love it, protects my phone really well"
-1,The pins are so rigid they can not be spread to fit snugly in any outlet. This charger takes almost twice as long as the OEM unit to charge my phone and tablet.
1,Perfect case
1,"Awesome head set, Great sound quality, easy to use and comfortable. Connects quickly to my phone. I like the fact it works  with the I Phones voice commands. Good Value"
-1,Nothing like I expected. The case is so bootleg
1,Fastest charger I've ever had
-1,"This fits the phone although not perfectly.  The problem is its bulky, stiff, hot, and uncomfortable to wear.  I wore it once and likely won't use it again."
1,awesome. You can adjust to whatever length you want and it will lock then you can rewind from that position with a little pull of the wire. You don't have to extend to full length to rewind like others. Good design.
0,"Its just okay. After reading lots of reviews, I decided to take a chance on it. My previous phone was a Nexus 5, and even though this phone has more memory and faster speed on paper, in actual use I don't see much difference. Its been a month since I got it, and its already sporting a cracked screen, it is not very tough at all, I have had mobile phones since the early 90's and this is the first phone I have ever broken. Asus wants nearly 100 bucks to fix it, not worth it to me for such a mediocre device.<br />Battery life is atrocious, off the charger at 6am and by noon lots of times its at 50% battery or lower. I am not a gamer nor do I watch video, I just email, talk and text, and social media. Unacceptable.<br />As soon as funds are available, I'll be looking for something else."
-1,The cover around the band comes of after a few days of use and heavy sweating. I received a replacement and it did the same thing 4 days later.Only part that stayed as it is described was the screen protector. Very upset I wasted money on this and still got charged for a faulty product.
1,Grate product!
1,Good price. Didn't ask for 3.  Came a day later than promised.  Overall I am satisfied.
1,Great price.Good case.
1,Needed this battery very much and it is working great in my phone.  Shall purchase from this seller again
0,Thought the rhinestones were raised and physible but instead it's fake. So got a little disappointed when received the item. Other than that it's fine.
1,Got what I ordered.  Works great.<br />Marty S
-1,This case does not fit an iPhone 5s like described!
1,"awesome, very useful"
1,This charger packs a lot of charge for its size. I can get 2-3 full charges for my iPhone out of it before needing to recharge.
1,works great.
1,"Good material, and protect my phone really good"
1,"I tried to scratch it with a knife.  I could not.  It went on easy. Bubbles practically eliminated themselves.  Make sure you place it high enough so that the top edge is above the front camera. Very tight tolerance and I put mine on a little low but luckily not too low. I also seem to have put it on slightly crooked, best evidenced in the photo of the lower left corner.  Curved screens on mobile phones is all the rage but it sucks for screen protectors.  This one does a fine job. It covers every pixel on the screen, left to right, and beyond top to bottom. Glare is not too bad. It's difficult to see fingerprints. It's easy to clean if you do get a smudge on it.  Very happy."
1,It matches my beats headphones and I love Soo much!
-1,"WASTE OF MONEY. First, I am in the U.S. and I received this item with a wall charger that with a plug that doesn't fit into U.S. outlets, I'm assuming it's a European plug of some sort. As I was leaving for my vacation in 2 days I kept the device. THEN on a 3 hour drive using the car charger the entire time the battery died. Tried to remove the charger from the gps unit but it was STUCK. Finally pulled hard on it and of course the plug ripped apart leaving the metal piece STUCK inside the GPS unit. I am now on vaction with NO GPS to use and will be going to a local store to buy another one. SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND MONEY AND JUST BUY A DIFFERENT GPS UNIT FIRST!!!  On the positive side - I called Amazon once I returned home, great Amazon customer service, refund was very easy."
1,Love it perfect for Samsung Note 3
-1,"The armband is uncomfortable, difficult to adjust and strap is beginning to fall apart within 1 month of regular use. I will return this item and purchase something else."
0,d
0,Fit perfectly and looks great. The phone lost touch sensitivity especially near the curved edges. It also collects smudges and gets foggy. Would not buy again.
1,"Awesome!!  Makes for a nice, dressy bracelet at weddings."
1,I recently bought this case without reading that Otterbox does not make an Armor series case for the iPhone 5c. So I gave it to my mom and I've finally switched to the LifeProof brand which is a little more expensive but the same quality and less weight. LifeProof also comes in the color white.
-1,- The performance is kind of ok. Not the best though. Good for the price I guess.<br /> - Not 100% comfortable to wear. It keeps kind of slipping off of the ear. Probably there might be a special way to wear it on. I have not figured it out yet.<br /> - N
1,"I have had these for a couple of months.  No problem pairing them with my Windows phone.  The volume buttons work well.  A little tricky though, as it will skip to the next song if you are not careful when using the volume buttons  (the manual tells you this).  I use them mostly when doing yardwork and they are plenty loud enough even with the lawn mower on.  I have had some problems when mowing, with the phone in my pocket, where the headphones cut out occasionally if there is some jostling, but not usually very often.  They are comfortable and stay in pretty well.  The track skipping feature works with online music apps as well, which is convenient.  Well worth the price I paid."
1,Great case. Easy to hold onto the phone. Attractive case.
1,I only gave it four stars because I got it for a friend he said it was great he tried two other batteries from some were else one lasted a week and the other started to expand in a day or two and these one has been going strong for six weeks and no problems so far great battery
1,if you have the newer phones these are a must have. Aftermarket chargers don't work
1,"Very comfortable. I use these while bike riding because the ear buds hurt your ears after a while as well as the sweat making it so they won't stay in.<br />With these they are comfortable over the ears on long rides and I can hear well even with the wind, which these help block out.<br />The resorption is great and the hands free answering calls works well. My callers say they can hear me well.<br />My only little nag is that they aren't as low profile on the sides as I would like but this wouldn't prevent me from purchasing them again.<br />Battery life is great and so far I have yet to run them dead after 3 hours continual use"
1,"Micro USB cables are one of the most widely used cables today, for a variety of electronics. While there are tons of different options and they may appears to be all pretty much the same, that is not true. Many products come with cheap cables that either A) Don't have the durability to last through extended uses B) Don't put quality material into their cord causing slower charging speed for your devices C) Slow data speed due to poor construction and materials. After years of hassling with tearing, broken, slow micro USB cords, I was so pleased to see a trusted brand such as Anker make a truly premium MicroUSB cable. This cable feels sturdy and strong right from the first minute you use it. The ends are reinforced to prevent breaking at the usual bend points. And the cable is reinforced with Kevlar to help it last much longer and withstand the daily wear and tear that we put our cables through. I'm also pleased to mention that the microusb end has a snug fit into my phone and doesn't fall out too easily like some other cheaper cords tend to do. Overall, this is an excellent product and the new benchmark of cables. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,"[[VIDEOID:643dca462e9a63b11b4fd427e1305850]] For the price it is great. I've had it now for about two years. It has seen the summer heat and -20F winter days. The internal battery is not really useful at all and fails quickly, but that wasn't a problem for me as I have the camera turn on and off with the vehicle's auxiliary power. It will also chew through maybe two micro SD cards a year, but that's because it's continuously writing to the card. Today I took it apart. I was surprised at the production quality, however the battery was bloated and had ruptured. I'm just going to replace it with an old cell phone battery and put it back to work.<br />I suppose I would give it a poor review if I had paid more for it, but for the price point it's great.<br />I have included a video of me reviewing a video using the included software (it is on the card, just insert into a computer and run the application). You can see my speed at the top and a google map on the side."
1,"Love this case, cheap but durable and cute! I've had mine for about a year and the only problem is the design wears off from where I have it in my scrub pockets."
1,Very good price for certified cables. They work great!
1,Very good
1,"I am 67 yrs. old and a rookie at using GPS's.  I bought this to use on a trip from Missouri to Wyoming, and will continue to use it."
1,I received my very first selfie stick today and am completely in love! The seller provided very fast shipping and packaged it well. I never knew selfies could look so much better. This hold my phone securely and I am able to make sure the photos are taken at a flattering angle. No more double chin or horrible pictures. I would highly recommend this to all cell phone selfie addicts it works amazing. You'll never have to worry about dropping your phone or posing weird to get a good photo.<br /><br />The company provided a sample for testing and review purposes.
-1,"Ordered almost a year ago. I was sent a faulty, mix match digitizer and screen, I sent it back being promised I would be sent a New one....8 months later I still have nothing."
0,it is fatter than just a regular cover.  My teen daughter did not like it at all.  It may be okay for a guy who never puts the phone in his pocket and wants to carry a few cards with him.
1,Works fine.
1,very pleased with this case.
1,"The packaging is simple. They don't give you an easy way to apply the protector without touching the sticky side, but I got it on and looks 9/10."
-1,NO GO!!!!!!!!!
1,Great
1,This case is soo cute! So girly and the colors are really pretty! I really recomend.
1,Very thin and easy to put on.
-1,I purchased it for a 200W Coleman quick air pump.  A few months later I took it out of the package for a camping trip. It first kept beeping at me then did not work at all.  Amazon will not let me return because beyond the 30 days.
1,Holds my LG G4 just fine and i love the dual charging capacity.
1,I love this case! It is super protective and a great color and quality! Definitely recommended.
-1,Never stayed in my ear and the volume control was always getting stuck on my shirt.
1,"amazing quality, very useful, thin and protective"
1,They were worth it
0,"This was mostly easy to put together, but the top of the screen where it locks down into the back of the phone had an issue, it seems their form is off because I was only able to get it flush by filing down the right hand corner before it would lock in.  Also, on the left upper corner, the glass is separating from the plastic display portion.  Disappointed in this, but it is an aftermarket product, can't expect quality I guess.<br /><br />I bought a phone cover that wraps around the whole screen so it will hold it all together.<br /><br />I was impressed with the little tool kit, the screwdrivers are magnetized, which is super important when dealing with such tiny screws.<br /><br />I like others took to youtube and other websites to actually get the repair completed, because the instructions and website included in the package did not help at all."
1,"I was a little bit skeptical about this case, especially because my iPhone 6 is brand new, HOWEVER, the case is literally perfect. Some cases can make the Plus very bulky but this is very lightweight and slim and the stand has worked wonders for watching Netflix :) The case is exactly the color as it appears in the picture and is an easy grip! Well done Spigen, well done!"
-1,Cheap quality
1,Phone is great. I mainly use for texting and keeping me organized and it has a very nice camera built inn. Battery life is the only issue it doesn't last very long.
1,It worked
0,good for the money
1,Good product
1,This is a neat little device that holds your iPhone while you ride o you can use Gps or listen to music to pass the time. Holds your phone securely --just remember to take phone with you if you stop at the market!
1,I like these.  really good for working out.  no issues thus far.
1,this is strong enough to hold an iphone 6 with a battery case (mophie)
1,"Tested it in my sink first with paper inside, and it was completely dry. It can be hard to open, but hey, it is waterproof! I can fit my Samsung Galaxy S6 with the Otter Box case inside. It is a tight fit, so I am careful when putting it in and taking it out so I don't rip the plastic."
1,great
1,Would be a 5 star if it covered the hold phone & not leave a little part uncovered
1,went on good and can't hardly tell you put it on
1,"Fun, updated, glittery, fun cover."
1,Perfect! Fast shipping! Would order again but hope I don't have to!
1,"So far so good.  For running you defiantly don't want to leave the chord bouncing on your neck.  It makes a loud thud sound every step.  BUT... what I do is either tuck it around my ears so the rest of the chord fits tight behind my head, or just wear the chord on top of my head.  The ear pieces with the right inner ear hook fits sooooo good.  I love this technique, rather than an outer ear hook.  Super conformable and really solid.  Defiantly wont fall out. I've had the blue tooth discount a couple of times.  Might be because the blue tooth receiver is on the right side.  I moved the phone to my right arm and it's been working pretty good.  My amazon blue tooth for my garage speakers always takes over and kicks the Mpow Swift off my phone.  So I have to leave my house before I connect it.  For the price I think it's a good deal.  But I've only used it twice on 4 mile runs."
1,"This is hands down the best thing I have ever purchased for my vehicle! I LOVE it. I have had a couple magnet holders for my truck in the past just checking them out and they all seemed to hold a little better than this. If you stick the metal piece that is attracted to the magnet to the back of your case/phone then it will definitely not go ANYWHERE. It's a very strong hold and I couldn't live without it anymore. Goes very well with a Bluetooth radio system because you don't have to mess with any wires at all unless you are charging. So you can just get in your vehicle and literally slap this thing onto your cash and BAM, it's there until you want it again. Everyone that rides with me is in amazement and I recommend it highly everytime. The main reason this item sold me is because it is so small and doesn't take much room up on my dash. The pivot is designed perfectly, it moves to where you want it with just the right amount of grip and once you let your phone go it stays put in any direction you leave it be. That was one of my main wonders when I was shopping is if it will stay tilted up or down or to the side, it will. Quit reading this review and buy the thing, I swear you won't regret it.<br /><br />The only thing I would say would be the &#34;cons&#34; is that I have noticed after having it for some time it has faded from the sun. Will attach a picture of the new color, if brown wouldn't match your vehicle and this will be in the path of the sunlight, you may want to purchase another similar item."
1,"I bought thewse a while ago so they've stood the test of time. Today, I needed to replace the tip but decided use a different color for a while. It struck me that the one I'd used for 6+ months looked as good as the new one. Always spot one one the touch screen and handy with the attachable cord....these stylus are the perfect blend of form anf function."
1,"It works very well .a visit to typhoon lagoon disney wave pool.Completely dry phone. In water all day ,and photos came out very well. All i heard was where did you get that?"
1,I brought this for my big brother for work he loves it and it's really easy to use.
1,"I've bought and used this car mount for my iPhone 6 recently. This is not a paid, free sample or sponsored product review. Here is my product review on this item:<br /><br />Packaging - Small, sturdy and packaged nicely. Items were wrapped nicely inside and came with two small cards with product and company information.<br /><br />Setup - Setting up the car mount is fairly easy. There are two main parts: the head (where the phone is held), and the body (where the mount stands/sticks to a surface). Connecting these two parts were fairly easy but did have some slight trouble when connecting them at first. Just make sure you hear the &#34;Click!&#34; sound when connecting the two pieces for connection confirmation.<br /><br />Usage - When using the car mount, the look, feel, and maneuverability of the car mount is great. Screen is completely visible, no blocks and can be corrected into the position you feel most comfortable. Landscape or portrait the phone when placed on the car mount is good. Sturdy, does not shake or wobble.<br /><br />Dis-assembly - After using the item and putting it away is also easy. Just undo the click for the two main pieces and voila! your done.<br /><br />Setbacks - I've only encountered two setbacks when using this product. 1) This product price will fluctuate. I bought mine for $10.99, week and a half later it was at $5.99. Could not get the difference because thanks to Amazon's pricing policy after 7 days you can not get the differentiated price difference. My loss.<br /><br />2) When using the car mount, the phone has a bottom bar where it &#34;sits&#34; comfortably, this bar unfortunately is opened in the middle for charging on the go, but blocks the headphone jack. So if you're in need of using the headphone jack while in the car for calls, or the AUX cable then it becomes tricky. Luckily I found a makeshift solution to the problem. You connect whatever you want into your headphone jack and THEN you place it on the car mount. Thanks tothe claws of the car mount on the side, it still stays in place with minimal to no movement.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy about this car mount. Would recommend to a friend. Any questions or comments feel free to post below."
1,"My daughter loves these and they fit comfortably on an adult head as well. Quite simply put, these are the best Bluetooth headphones for the price you will find anywhere. The company also has excellent customer service and makes their kid friendly approach very apparent. I suspect that if an adult purchased these headphones they would not be able to beat them for the quality and comfort at this price point either. After nearly 8 months of being used every day these still look and work as if they were brand new. I feel comfortable highly recommending this product for children and most adults as well though if your head is larger than that of the average size of a 180 pound male, then they may not fit comfortably."
1,Like the phone. Still having trouble with downloading photos in messaging.
-1,first one broke after 2 days and the other quit after 1
1,Granddaughter loved it. What more can I say.
1,Great fit and all buttons works through the bumper.  just enough of a berm around it so that neither screen nor back rest on whatever you set it down on.<br /><br />Vendor shipped quickly and packing was sufficient.
1,great one i like it
1,Great phone but YouTube app don't work I have to use the browser to watch YouTube
1,"A quality product from a quality brand. A few considerations:<br /><br />1. The case is easy to take on and off because it's a bit flexible<br />2. Slim, but you can still feel the increased size of your phone. But the iPhone is slim to begin with so no big deal.<br />3. Buttons are functional, only slightly harder to press<br /><br />This case is for those who don't really want a case but need the protection. A worthwhile investment considering the hefty price tag on the iPhone. I was given this case for my objective evaluation."
1,"Excellent product, fits great... I paired this up with my favorite case the NewTrent Trentium (removed stock plastic screen protector and used this tempered glass) it looks flawless! Thank you JETech for making such a high end, quality tempered glass screen protector for such a reasonable price... Very satisfied customer for life here! :) Thank you"
1,Works nice
1,"These headphones are exactly what I've been looking for for past few years.  I bought these for running and find that they never fall out or adjust uncomfortably in my ear.  Problems I had in the past consisted of my left ear (for some reason) always fitting differently than my right.  Chewing gum would gradually shift them. And the up and down movement of running would cause annoying interference sounds.  Piece of advice... take the time to do a little trial and error with the ear pieces and cord clip while doing what ever activity you bought them for.  In the end it's worth every minute.<br /><br />For those with battery problem or just starting out, I strongly suggest giving it a full charge before using.  Once charged, keep using until battery is completely drained and repeat this process at least twice initially.  After that, continue doing so  at least once every one or two months.  I used to sell work for Verizon and found that draining or &#34;cycling&#34; the battery is the best way to increase any rechargeable battery.  So far it has worked for me brilliantly."
1,Brought my phone back from the dead. Very happy with the time it took for delivery
1,Really holds it's charge and I like how I can charge two items at one time.
1,"I love the case, I think I made the right choice"
1,"This is nice for watching movies.<br />Fast computer. Windows 8 is very frustrating though. Otherwise it is great for surfing internet, shopping, taking photos and checking email."
1,Cool l like it :)
1,loved it!
1,This wallet is so cute and exactly what I was looking for. It even fits in my back pocket.
1,"Very nice, very clean, very (handsome) case. It is exactly as shown in the picture. I recommend it"
0,The plastic face had a label on it ... that didn't peel off smoothly.
1,It's a very good case for the money.  Bot an extra glass piece and replaced the plastic front.  I am happy with both.
1,Excellent !!!!!
1,"love it ,perfect for what its needed for"
1,"didnt work out for me display was scrambled purple and white you might have much better luck than me, if you have a problem do contact seller"
1,"My son loves this. It's not much bigger than the phone itself, so it's not bulky and he loves the kickstand feature."
-1,"Don't think it is the correct one, I have to take it off to charge my phone."
-1,"Unfortunately, this didn't work out so well.  Bought it for my son and he says it doesn't stay on the phone, keeps falling off."
1,"This is a great screen protector as it nicely fits the face of the phone, without interfering with the curved edge of the S6. I also like the provided back cover as it will cover the back of the phone from minor scratches etc even though the phone will be in a case all the time."
1,Love the design of this case. The only issue I was concerned about was the tempered glass protector that I had put on my screen before the case. The case fit over with no problem and the screen is still very reactive to my touch
-1,"Picture and description showed RED as the color of the case, when I got the package it was SF Giants Orange."
0,"Guess this is my last Blu phone - WiFi disconnects when the phone goes to sleep. Contacted Blu support and they advised to perform a hard factory reset of the phone. I bought this phone after returning the [[ASIN:B00PYWQ7SI BLU Studio 5.0 C HD Unlocked Cellphone, White]] which had a similar problem (but way worse as WiFi would not reconnect unless it was disabled and reenabled).<br /><br />That's 2 Blu phones in 2 weeks with similar issues..I thought it was a defect the first time, but the 2nd time? I'm not so sure anymore...<br /><br />The Studio X is a decent phone otherwise (nice looking, good display, nice pics, pretty responsive, latest OS, etc) but the WiFi issue is a dealbreaker for me..."
1,love it fit perfect
1,Fancy and pretty. Fits perfectly on the cell. Exactly what I wanted.
1,"This was the first Quick Charge 2.0 Portable battery I found available, and it does not disappoint.<br /><br />I don't even use my older chargers anymore, as Quick Charge charges my phones (that are Quick Charge compliant) so much faster (hours faster). This works perfect when you need a quick burst of extra power for your music, phone calls, gps, etc.<br /><br />The price is also competitive. Thanks Aukey!"
1,"This thing is great. I was a little skeptical at first, figuring that it would be similar to several other chargers I have purchased  over the years with pitiful results. This is the real deal. The fit and function of the ports is definitely high quality, and it has worked perfectly, even on my picky &#34;device not supported&#34; iPad and iPhone 6.  I would definitely recommend this as probably the last phone charger you'll ever need to buy. Good job Anker!"
1,Purchased for my daughter who wanted to show off the actual phone.  She loves it.
0,Case is completely water proof however it is difficult to hear people and to press the home button through. Would not recommend as an everyday case...but would be great for maybe camping or fishing trips.
1,"Great product.  Just check the size before you buy.  Others might see this a bit big and weighty but the capacity is great.<br />Also, there is no instruction for the flashlight feature.  You have to press the power button about 3 seconds, then it will light up.  Same thing when you turn it off."
0,"I like the idea of  using this product to give my dog something to chase.  However, it is a little challenging for me to direct. Good news, my son has no problem manipulating this product."
1,"very good. small, fast charge, can charge my old phone battery. (not smartphone) It can charge 3.7v battery."
1,Work very well.
1,Works exactly as advertised. Very good product.
0,it chipped within the first couple of day of using it
1,"Great!!! Love it, haven't dropped w case on yet so haven't tested it that way but the case is great quality.  but sometimes comes apart"
-1,"the product came with two lenses rather than three but I could have lived with the two if the lenses worked at all, they don't. The fish eye does indeed distort the image but the increased field of view is limited and the macro lens was useless. I wasn't expecting a great deal from the optics for 5.99 but this kit is useless. The lenses were to used for a kids science project, the kit was useless so I ended up cannibalizing an LED flashlight lens which worked fine. Save your money , don't buy this kit."
-1,"I had high hopes for this battery, after reading all the reviews. I received it 2 days earlier than expected, which was great. However, after it was installed, the battery came with a charge at 26% and would not charge anymore. I tried several chargers, but no luck. This product was a disappointment and a waste of time. Try at your own risk."
1,great
1,"i wish these were a bit longer, i found one at Tuesday mornings that is 6 ft"
1,"Great, works well, attractive"
1,Great quality!
-1,"It compatibale with Samsung and iPhone, but not with ZTE"
1,Nice
1,Came when it said it would. Inexpensive. Good product.
1,"I haven't hooked it up yet, but if I'm to go by the brand, it definitely seems promising!"
-1,I don't know how they can claim this is water proof. I wore it in the shower by accident once and now it doesn't work anymore.  Update: after letting it dry out for two days it finally works again but I will never ever trust getting it wet even washing my hands or in the shower and unfortunately I will definitely never try to swim with it on.
1,Works well for the cost and value if you don't want to sell your arm for a phone case
0,Definitely not scratch resistant. Good case overall though. Had it 2 weeks and its heavily scratched already.
1,"I am rough on phone holsters. These fit my iPhone 6 very well and I order them 2 at a time. They have a belt loop, so I don't lose my phone by it slipping off."
1,Great product for the price!!
0,"I love the quad lock, however the little rubber bands break too easily.  Just normal handling of your bike while loading it on your rack or into your vehicle, can cause them to break.  Of course you can use the zip ties, but then the mount does not seem as secure or tight.  There has to be a better way.  For now, I am using old fashioned rubber bands and keep a few of them handy in my bike bag just in case."
1,Loved it!
-1,not easy to install. if you get one spec of dust on the side that sticks to the tablet it is impossible to get it cleaned.  You would need a 'clean room' to install these.
1,"I like:<br />- Been through 3 or 4 drops onto carpet with this case, no damage at all.<br />- Sturdy construction<br />- Dust protection for headphone and micro usb port<br /><br />I dislike:<br />- Plastic case is difficult to slip over the rubber gasket at first<br />- No grip compared to my last (leather) case. The plastic is smooth. I've dropped it a few times because of this.<br />- Buttons are stiff and hard to push until it is broken in (maybe 3-4 months). Even then, you lose some of the tactile feedback of the button. Still worth it.<br /><br />Note:<br />- I'm not using the plastic screen protector. The Galaxy S3 comes with gorilla glass, so no need."
1,"I love this case! The only reason I gave it one less star is because I cannot fit my headphone cord into the hole through the case when I want to listen to music. In order to do so, I have to remove the case."
1,Great case. Kickstand works well
-1,"didnt fit, I blame nobody except amazon"
1,Seems good only problem so far it is a tight fit and therefore difficult to get off. At least I will not lose it!
1,"This is a very nice case for my iPhone 6. The phone fits nice and snug and I do not have to worry about it falling out. The case does a great job at protecting the phone from bumps, dings, scraps and scratches. It also does a nice job of protecting the phone from medium drops. I have dropped mine a couple times and the phone came away with no damage. All the cut outs and buttons are perfectly placed so there is easy access to all the ports and the buttons are easy to find and press. I can plug up my charger cable and earphones without having to remove the case. The front of the case has a nice lip around the edge of the screen so the glass never touches any surfaces. The case adds very little thickness to the phone which is a huge plug in my book. The cover is clear so I can see the awesome look of my iPhone 6. It also does not show finger prints or other smudges like other clear cases I have had. The lanyard is a nice touch to a great case. I can now wear my phone around my neck and not worry about dropping it when my hands are full. I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review."
1,"Pretty and not bad for the price. I'm basically happy with it, but be aware it won't close if you have more than a couple credit cards in its pockets."
0,These are not the 2a chargers and will not work with items that require that power input. Not equivalent to the standard power adapter for apple products.
1,I love this case.  I will reorder one for every new phone I have.
1,Love it! Fit perfect.
1,"I got it and had to return it because I realized that it wasn't going to protect my phone as well as the otterbox has been...I like the design, but this color is a lot more neon than it shows in the picture. If I could do it all over again, I would go with the light blue I saw somewhere else on Amazon. The back is really slippery, not a lot a grip, but not horrible!"
1,Perfect but it's hard to turn the phone on because the button on the case is hard to push.
1,"I love the phone but there's a problem with the battery, it did not charge to the fullest after a week it cannot charge none at all have the phone and cannot use it can you please send me a replacement battery thank you"
1,Perfect
1,"Very cute, fits phone great and got it day early :)"
0,batteries overheated but probably because the woman cant stay off her phone
1,works good and charges fast
1,lived Up to my expations
1,"Great phone, greater price. 10/10 would get phone again"
1,Like that my kids can't destroy their iPads now
1,Good quality. Can be used as clip on or thru loops. Arrived in just couple of days.
1,"works as advertised!  Takes awhile to charge, but can charge many iPhones and other items."
1,I love mine fits right in my truck
1,Very high quality product.  Recommended.
-1,"Worked for a while, then stopped"
1,The quality of the items are wonderful! I received items within a week and 2 days.
1,Is good.
1,"AMAZING! It has kept my phone in one piece for the last few years. Countless drops and all, it has been a saving grace!"
-1,Cheep and did not last
1,The case is sturdy and eye pleasing. It is bulky but manageable more in a purse than a pocket. The clip is handy. Glad my search is over. Worth the price.
1,This thing is great! Used it at my wedding and it was a lot of fun. Highly recommend. No battery needed and very easy to use! Even bought my dad one!
-1,Never fit right
1,Great price and charges well
1,Great stylus to use. Most stylus last about a week with me but this one have been use months and still as new as the day I got it.
1,The phone case is great and it got here fast.
0,"Pro: much better sound than expected for the price, especially considering it is mostly plastic.<br /><br />Con: the buttons do not work with any consistency, which is particularly bad when trying to turn off the speaker to preserve power for  the underwelming rechargeable battery that is used (estimated charge of only 4 hours)."
1,Ok!
1,perfect for my s5
1,"It has been a lovely case so far and taken a lot of falls. It is not as pastel like as it is in the picture, but I still like the color."
1,"I tried various different phone holders, this is the most solid one. It works well with regular cars. For tall vehicles such as minivans, however, it is a little too low in position."
-1,Too complicated!
1,good for price
1,Terrific!
1,Great battery case recharges phone for more than one full charge.  Does not sync in battery case. Good protection as a case also.
1,"Works good, item as specified. Nothing more to say"
1,"The quality of this case was extremely impressive!  I ended up getting two more different colors, was really surprised and will never purchase a case in the store again.... Thanks 😁"
0,Looks very good and feels strong but the charger doesn't fit with the case on. Im searching for some new charger that fits with the case on because its very uncomfortable to be opening the case every time the battery goes off
1,"Great product. Quality, snug fit. Does a great job holding up to 3 credit cards. Don't bother trying more. Highly recommended."
1,This works brilliantly. Well made. Great length for easy carry and does not get tangled up like longer cords.
1,I bought the black for my black Apple watch sport. I love how it looks and protects my watch. The price is perfect and the quality is good. Very happy with the product.
1,Does the job well. Great product for the price.
-1,"My iPad Air immediately didn't like this cord.  Out of the package, these cords looked impressive with a cool nylon braid inside a plastic outer covering...  I was immediately optimistic, but unfortunately it was an immediate disappointment.  It would barely trickle a charge to the iPad...  As in after 8-10 hours it was still only 70% charged.<br /><br />Within a few days, the bits comprising the plug head itself (the part that plugs into the tablet) so that then the cord had to be resting just so in order to work at all...  Needless to say I returned it to Amazon and spent a couple bucks more for an Anker brand cord which has performed flawlessly.<br /><br />In defense of this cord, it does come a 2-pack.  When the first one failed, I just returned the pair and never tried using the second one.  Perhaps they are so cheap to make in China that they just provide two rather than having quality control at the factory!  Although the second cord could have been fine, based on my experiences with the other one, I would absolutely not recommend this product."
1,"Just what I wanted, it fit my 6 inch Garmin perfectly."
0,Small and convenient but you can only really fit 2 or 3 cards in without worrying about ripping the inside. Also doesn't like to stay open. All in all its okay though
1,"Pretty much the best bang for buck head unit. Feature-wise it goes toe to toe with all the 600-1k head units out there, and I'm not a hardcore audiophile so the quality it gets out of my stock 2005 Tacoma speakers is phenomenal.<br /><br />Do NOT buy that $15 bypass thing for the parking brake. Just take the green wire and tape it to the head unit hahaha. Or I loosened a screw and wrapped the wire around it so it's constantly connected to the body of the HU, which grounds it and now I have video all the time. Saves you the trouble of finding which wire in your car is the parking brake wire and tapping into your factory wiring. This is the video that opened my eyes to this: https://youtu.be/hd0rz3iMrPQ?t=1m27s<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - The menu navigation takes a few min of learning but in general it does make sense and is quite easy<br />  - The customizable color themes means it now matches my interior lights perfectly. EVERYONE asks what the stock radio was like, because it matches factory look so perfectly<br />  - Boot up time is super fast. Pretty much 3-5 sec after ignition til you get audio<br />  - Its bluetooth connectivity with my iphone is even better than my BMW, invoking my phone to start playing music right away. With my BMW I have to pull out my phone and get the music going.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - Wish it was easier to figure out when some features are enabled / disabled. For example the AV In/Out is always grayed out for me until randomly it was enabled. The My Vehicle is still disabled for me. Probably RTFM issue.<br />  - It didn't perfectly fit my double-din dash kit for my Tacoma, even though the kit got rave reviews for perfect fitting. So I'm not sure if this thing is just slightly above double-din or my kit is wonky..."
-1,"Not charge the phone, after a couple used"
1,Excellent Thank You..
1,Great case
1,Love it!
1,"I have invested in a great product who's price allows everyone to get excellence at low cost. Keep the price low, please. Thank you."
1,"Great protection, but case discolored and looked dirty after only a few weeks."
-1,After a day I'm going to send it back. I can't hear the person on the other end very well and if I turn my head it makes a loud noise.
0,Pretty! But I dropped it once and the had portion of the case broke... this was like 2 days after receiving it.
-1,Broke after only about 5 uses.
-1,"I did not work. It is the second time trying to buy this item. I just wanna give up, i do not even want a refund. I am just gonna buy less items thru here."
1,I really like this it fits into my purse and I can find it because of the color<br />and it does the job!
-1,Accurate description. Fits loosely. Wouldn't buy it again.
1,notter box
1,Just want I needed for the head unit.
1,Awesome. Better than I even could hope.
1,"This gives my phone such personality, it fits great, and it is lasting well for the price!"
1,"Beautifully done. It's a little difficult to remove once it's installed. Feels a little flimsy...but it looks great, It probably doesn't provide any protection to the phone if it falls. Ships from China."
1,"How have I ever lived without this?!  After 2 days of having it, my mom ended up getting one it white!  One of my top 3 purchases of 2015!"
1,"The case fits my phone well. I was bike riding, my phone dropped face down in the street, and survived with no damage. I was impressed!"
0,"This one is nice but it did not close all the way. Plus when talk, I had to use my hand held the case open so it is inconvenience and I do not use it now. I only use it for about a week."
-1,It had a strong smell to it
1,Excellent
1,works perfect
1,"I bought this over a year ago, still works great.  Hope this was a bit more compact, then even easier to carry during traveling."
1,Husband likes it
1,Great case nice bulky and protects my screen and camera well.
1,Very pleased with this extra battery for my LG G3 cell phone. Have no complaints. Would recommend it to anyone.
1,Received extremely quick.  Was easy to apply.  I like the feel of the screen much better with the screen protector on.  I just hope it does actually protect the glass from shattering.
1,Perfect fit and easy to use.
0,"The case design is as it shoes in the picture and its good. however the iPhone needs to be more snug in the case, it seems it a little loose and it can easily be popped out."
1,"love it-- sturdy and really cute. wish there was someway to attach a wrist strap. with drivers license and credit cards in case, sometimes, that's all I need."
1,great
1,Even the dealer was envious of this item.
0,Little hard to put on phone.
1,it was great shipped in a fast time frame. Thanks
1,Product came earlier than anticipated. The batteries seem to hold up just as well as the original LG battery.
1,Good instructions & installation tools. Still hard to install correctly.
1,I love the sound. Smooth integration with my iPhone and ipad. Everything works as it should be. love it.
1,"I love this case. Nice and feel solid. I can hold the phone much better because the case gives you more grip and doesn't feel slippery at all. I little hard to take off though, so make sure you have everything set before putting the case on. Otherwise, this is an absolutely excellent case."
1,i dropped my galaxy 5 times and there are only three cracks that appear on the screen! imagine if i didnt have this ballistic screen cover?! it is great. the reason i gave it 4 stars is due to the diffaculty of installation. You cannot take it off and readjust the cover it wont stick again. other than that its great if you hav invested in a phone.
1,Installed easily.  Video was a nice touch.
1,"Perfect delivery time, excellent product"
1,I am actually pretty happy with it. It does what it says it does and it came with a waterproof bag that I can put a hook on if I do water sports or anything on the water! It does on the other hand become really hard to open once its sealed on your iPod.
-1,The case seemed to attract dirt... Product is just ok
-1,"The cover itself is still holding together.  However, the camo image started wearing off immediately, just by putting it in his pocket. I took maybe a month or so before it was unrecognizable. It is now just silver."
1,I liked this brand so much that I purchased another case for a different phone. It resembles the Outer Box.
1,"Excelent product, best price"
-1,Nice throw away item.
1,Much nicer and solid that any other case I've used. Provides excellent protection
-1,"Works, but clunky to use.  NOT INTUITIVE..."
1,Very practical device Thank you
1,Great deal! Love the length and definitely charges quickly!
1,"Looks exactly like the picture, comes with lanyard. Tested with paper towels and other various paper items. Works just fine. Just be sure to completely close the top."
1,Great case for a great price!
1,Husband love the length and sturdiest<br />Of cord
-1,This case is horrible I just received it yesterday and it is already coming apart this is complete bull s***
1,My daughter is extremely satisfied with this case. Fits the iPod Touch 5 perfectly and provides a better grip. Colors are bold and match well with the original pink color of the unit.
1,Exc product
1,Excellent stylus - my favorite
1,For the price its great.
1,It fit nicely and worked well.
1,"Great adapter to use in the car, both kids can watch the same movie at the same time"
1,"I've used this at a water park, amusement park, and the beach. The Velcro strap stay on my arm for all of the roller coasters and I was able to record the ride. I had it in the ocean completely submerged at some point and it worked! Some water got into the top plastic sealing part but that was it. It never got to my phone. Totally worth it!"
1,Arrived quickly and saved my phone!
-1,Fall apart and break on the micro usb side. Do not buy this brand.
1,easy to apply. great product
1,cool on hand
-1,Too bad this arrived with a broken piece inside 😕
1,The fit is great and does a wonderful job at protecting my phone. What I don't care for is how it makes pushing the volume and power button difficult.
1,It's excellent. Just wish it came with a clip
1,Great case
1,love the colors
1,Great purchase.
0,"The product is nice but doesn't fit my phone, which is a Samsung Galaxy Note Edge. I rated it a 3 because of the inconvenience of having to return it."
1,Great screen protector.
-1,Wrong size and it'll cost more to send it back then it did to buy it. I'm gunna sell it on ebay. Lol
1,Very glittery<br />Loved it.
1,Arrived fast. I gave it four stars because it don't always turn the phone off when shutting case you still need to shut it off manually.
1,"It is ok, except I have to restrap it everytime.  Other than that is excellent.  The strap is not big enough to strap around my bicep, but fits the forearm."
1,"I have been amazed at how great this has been for my phone. I took my time, followed the directions carefully to apply the screen.  I can't tell its on the phone, but I feel it has saved my screen unlimited times.  I think careful application is the key.  This screen has surpassed all the screens I had on my other phones."
-1,"It did not fit my phone, and also looked cheap."
1,Thank you for this great product. Item was as described and I still have it on my phone.
1,"Love it!  But over time, there will be dye transfer from your jeans if you are the type to put in your back pocket :)"
1,I love the way this cover looks and fits my phone.
0,"Purchased this item on June 4th, 2014. It worked perfectly until two weeks ago when it stopped working when attached to my laptop. For whatever reason, it still works fine when plugged into a wall mount."
1,"I have an old car and with no AUX port or bluetooth. I have tested few bluetooth FM transmitter and the latest one is the Rii Geartist GB01.  The box includes a magnetic back GB01, magnetic backplate sticker & dual car charger. Below are few pros and cons which will help you figure if this product is good for you.  PROS: 1. Packing is frustration free so it good. 2. The design is smooth and nicely done. 3. Its got volume control with channel changer, dedicated FM signal button and a button to accept calls and pause them. 4. Bright FM signal numbers. 5. Good signal once you find an empty one in your local area.  CONS: 1. I faced static sound issues after I started driving my car even once the GB01 was connected. After some driving distance the static lowered and I had to bump up the volume for a better sound.  Lastly I would say that this product is good and has great potential to give you endless musical experience.  Note: I got this product to test and provide my unbiased opinion"
-1,It was so bad that it's hilarious! I got two completely different watches! Tried to get a refund and it did not even happen. Such a waste!!
1,nice little kit - can always use various size cables
1,I only use it on road trips and so far it works great as long as I have a cell tower signal.
-1,Poorly made. Refund is worthless as they charge as much to return it as the original cost. Don't bother with it...
-1,"Terrible, Horrible and a total waste of money... I purchased these for my husband who is in his mid 50's ... Daily activity is walking the dog both morning and evening whilst listening to music.... He complained that the sound is not great quality but it's ok because he plays it low enough to hear his surroundings... The quality of the product felt firm when removed from the package..The problem is the ear hooks, which, from after two weeks usage, started becoming loose and falling off... Due to the design, with the connecting cable.. my husband was very careful with these headphones.<br />It appears as if the weight of the headset was too much for the hooks, or the way the hooks sre connected should be improved... Now I have to purchase him another bluetooth headset ...."
-1,Does not fit HTC phone
-1,Got these cables because they said they were guaranteed and had a lifetime warranty.  They work for about a week then break.  Have been sent replacement cables which work for about a week then break.  The company kept me on the hook long enough so I went past the 30 rerun date with Amazon.  They suck don't buy them
-1,Battery died after one charge only.Useless phone.
1,Everything ok
1,It protected my phone and also look goods .
0,"Was expecting something sturdier, but instead it's a piece of plastic that's painted silver.  Looks better in pictures."
0,"When I try to charge battery through the solar panels, the battery light increases to 3 blue bars but later goes back to 1 blue bar. Is the battery not charging or is it losing battery?"
0,"Purchased the 4 channel 1600 watt version.  Ran it for a week just running my door speakers and worked flawlessly.  Easy to install, easy to tune and sounded good on my door speakers.<br /><br />Once I added a single 10&#34; subwoofer, the amp would go into protection mode.  Amp claims it is 2 ohm stable, but it is now.  I was running a single 10 with dual 4 ohm voice coils and when you have the volume up and the bass hits, the amp shuts down.<br /><br />Amp sounded good when it was running, but doesn't last very long.  Probably works great with subs in 4 ohm, but does not work in 2 ohms."
1,Most of us have probably been there before. You reach into your pocket to grab you phone and it takes off and goes for a tumble. Well we all learn our lesson eventually and need to find us a nice case to keep it safe.<br /><br />The Collen iPhone 6 case offers two layers of protection. The first is the silicone layer that covers the phone. The second is a hard plastic exterior to assist with drops and scratches and keep the silicone layer tightly in place. I do mean tightly. This is one of the tightest cases I have seen yet to have such a great fit.<br /><br />I love these sleek cases. They keep the iPhones footprint as small as possible to squeeze it into your pockets yet still add a nice protection to it.<br /><br />It also comes with a kick stand on the back to keep the iPhone upright will watching a video or such. That feature has won the approval of my son. This part worries me a little. Every time I have an item with a small plastic kick stand the plastic brace always seems to break off like it did on my iPad recently.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
1,"I've been using this phone for a few weeks now after switching off my Galaxy S3.  I loved the GS3 when it was new but it's been showing its age and slowing down tremendously.<br /><br />The LG G3 is a great successor.  It's mostly vanilla Android which is great but there are a few cool features I use a lot.<br /><br />1) double tap on the screen to turn on/off - love not having to feel around the back for the power button only to (inevitably) press on the camera lens (if there was any downside to the design, that would be it.  Circular power button just below the circular camera?  not smart, LG)<br />2) This was a one time setup thing, but using NFC to pull my settings and apps from my GS3 to the G3 was awesome and such a time saver.  Well done, Android!<br /><br />One more thing, I was looking at this phone over some of it's competitors mostly to get the best camera in an android phone and this does not disappoint.  It has taken crystal clear pictures.  I really like the camera interface and I like how I can use hand gestures to take the picture.  This makes taking a selfie with my baby to send to my wife a snap (HA! get it?)."
1,"This cable works as expected and looks great, however it is a little too stiff."
1,Love love love it
1,the ear piece is excellent
1,"Great radios.  I used them a couple of weeks ago when I went on a road trip and some offroading.  On open highway/freeway, you get around 3/4 to 1 mile line of sight range.  The radios have a loud, clear volume unlike the FRS radios that you can get.  I used them for hours without the batteries wearing down.  I bought the programming cord for them too but have not programmed them.  I have not used them indoors so I do not know how far they will transmit.<br /><br />If you have been looking for a really great set of 2 way radios, these are the ones to get."
1,I get compliments on these all the time.
0,love the case but its a little bit too hard to make it fit so on one side is not really fixed right
1,As expected
1,Fits well and looks great
0,"Worked well at first but then seemed to have glitches.  Won't always charge when attempting, but when it does charge, it works as expected.  For the money, maybe worth it, as it is 1/4 the price of other products."
-1,Easy to install but time consuming. Works much better then other products. Be patient when installing.  Editing: the screen protector only lasted a few days before the corners started rolling up and coming off.
1,Great for the price! Easy to install. I've used the regular screen protectors on every iPhone I've have but I like this one way better.
0,Nice product
1,This works great.  It charges both my iPhone 5 and iPad 4 very quickly and with no problems.
0,I am sure there is nothing wrong with the battery but it doesn't fit in my iPod. Pretty useless to me.
1,love it :)
1,Fits perfectly.  Very cute
1,"Just what I was looking for, but had to add my own adhesive belt clip cause this only comes in a wallet version"
1,Durable and sturdy
1,High quality and makes me confident about the security of my phone while using.
1,Easy to assemble and use.  Very sturdy.
-1,"I've had four pair. The sound is excellent, and they fit my ear (few earbuds do). The problem I've had with every one is that despite all my best efforts, they all eventually shorted out. The weakness is in the cord where it leaves the plug. Normal wear and tear bending will ruin it in a few months. I've managed to make them last up to 6-7 months by wrapping that part of the cord in electrical tape, but it looks like crap and eventually fails anyway. After two years and $160+ (I got one store to replace a set without charge), I'm ditching the brand and looking elsewhere. Such great sound and a solid fit, but if they can't manage to engineer a cord that doesn't break, it's an expensive and useless gadget."
1,"Love!!!!!<br /><br />***UPDATE - 6 months later and I still LOVE!!!  My phone goes everywhere I go, room to room, inside outside, so it gets handled a lot. And this case can handle it!! It still looks new. Not one loose stitch, pockets still tight.  Magnet still strong. You do have to open clutch to take picture, which at times bothers me - but I am not a big picture taker so no biggie.  No longer carry purse cause this has all my personal id's, credit cards that I need. I am very impressed with this case and would buy again!!"
1,"Very nice case. The rim sticks out past the front of the case a little, so your screen is protected if you place it face-down on a table. Fits snugly and never falls off, yet easy to remove if you need to access the battery, sim, or SD. Liked it so much, my mom just bought one (although she had to get a different pattern, since this particular one is now out of stock). I highly recommend this case, as well as all other colors and patterns of the same mode."
1,To big
1,"Just recieved it today , havent used it yet but seems like a good product that will do the job."
1,I just received it and haven't used it yet.  The bluetooth paired and works.  The design is great.  The phone fits really snug.  It appears that it will work well.  It is nice quality.
1,Great product fast delivery.
-1,didn't fit well
-1,"no use at all, screen break in the third day. will never buy this again"
1,"Its amazing, loves it."
0,"Good price but no detail on the map. It only shows water and land - that's it!  No fathom lines, no buoys or channel markers, nothing.  The fish finders and side view work surprisingly well for the price.  Their main limitation is that the screen is small but that's part of the package so it's not really a complaint."
1,Very nice. Thank you
1,Awesome!
1,"Bought it for my wife and it seems to be a decent case, and she loves purple."
-1,Never worked anywhere.
1,excelente.
1,This is a very sturdy case for the iPhone 6.  It comes in 2 pieces...a black rubber case and then a pink (or whatever color you choose) plastic cover.  The case has port covers for the charging port and the silent button which will keep sand/crumbs/etc. out of the ports. I really like it.
1,Ordered on Saturday and received it on Monday!
1,"Overall nice case, protects the screen when it's in my pocket (mainly what I was looking for). My one complaint is the flap that holds the cover shut. The seam at the edge rubs against the phone every time you close it (that tension is what keeps it shut), and seems to be causing quite a bit of wear over a short time (just over a month as of writing), making me question just how long this case will last."
0,"This case has good quality feel to it, the color is true to the picture displayed. But the reason for the 3 stars, the charger outlet is hard to access with the case still on. I have to remove the case first before I can charge my phone. Another reason is that the case is hard to put on my Note 2.<br /><br />Compared to other cases purchased from Amazon this is in my Top 5."
1,You can use all of the phone features while it is in the waterproof bag.
1,Its great one
1,"Absoultely perfect. the included install guide makes this super easy to install. Comes with everything needed to install: clean, dry, guide, and holder.<br />A+++ I got this at a discount for my honest review but even full price is good price for the quality compared to other brands. All my comments and feedback are my own opinion.<br />Any questions I'll do my best to answer"
1,"Fast delivery, works well"
1,I have brought mine to the beach a few times and i feel a lot better about using it near sand and water
1,So far so good. Strong hold  bendable bar could be stiffer but it works good
1,Not a bad idea to a spare!! Great product.
1,"low price, high quality"
-1,Have not used all of the cables yet. First one did not work  (to charge from a computer) until paired with a wall charger unit.
1,"I really like this case. It's not bulky at all, it's slim and sleek. The case offers protection, great design and the sense of security knowing that your case is durable. It's simple to put on phone and doesn't interfere with plugging in charging cables or headphones. This case also comes with a kickstand built in the back. The kickstand is sturdy and does it's job. Not to mention, it came with a tempered glass screen protector and screen wipes.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,This thing is great. I bought it because I spend a lot of time on a kayak fishing. I like to have my phone readily available but would hate to have to replace it because it got wet or I dropped it in the lake so this waterproof pouch is the answer. It works excellent!
1,excellent
0,like it
1,Love my ill panda buddy hangin out on top my phone..lol
1,"amazing results, and i love their customer service."
1,Works as intended
1,"fast delivery, totally satisfied"
1,nice case
1,It works well for me being a trucker it gives me all the shortest routes
1,"Worked out great, thanks. Mounted on three of my four phones."
1,Great product
1,I've had this case for about a month and it has been great so far! Really happy with this product.
1,Fit really good
-1,"Its hard to get on and my screen protector is bubbling up,and it's hard to get on...worst case ever I have to buy a new case and screen protector."
1,Perfect case !!!!!!!!!
-1,It came with no usb cable at all.
1,Quick delivery and they seem to take more charges before wearing out
1,"Perfect for charging 2 kindles, my Bose rechargeable headphones and my MP3 player simultaneously"
1,"Got this case a few months ago, It works great. The kickstand is also a plus!"
-1,This shield is pretty crappy for the nexus took me awhile to get it installed. Then it doesn't cover much of the phone. I ended up getting an intelliAmor Pro for the nexus 6 it's a better fit on the phone.
1,Have to be careful to assemble on the dock station.
1,Good for the price you pay.
-1,"This product is complete trash. I ordered this months ago and it still is not at my house and on my apple watch. I contacted the seller and I get all these BS excuses like &#34;oh to get you the best product we are going to take weeks on end to ship this to you&#34; this seller is Untrustworthy and incapable of making proper sales DO NOT BUY, there are better ones out there who's seller is capable of satisfying a consumer. Trust me SELLER IS GARBAGE AND PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"
1,"Excellent.  It keeps all my electronics charged at all times.  I don't have to keep looking for AC outlets at the airport.  Furthermore, I heard that some public phone charging outlets may be stealing people's data when they plug in to charge."
1,Awesome!!
1,Looks great with my gold iPhone
1,Works really well.
-1,"Self-destructed very quickly, not worth the effort to return."
-1,Cheap both in price and in quality
1,I purchased this to hep me keep track of my steps but it has many additional benefits.  I highly recommend if you're that person that wants to be reminded not to get stuck at your desk too much or to do better about going to bed.
-1,IT CAME IN BROKEN AND THE BACK OF THE CASE WAS SCRATCHED UP
1,"slips off occasionally but otherwise no complaints, fits well, good quality, durable, keeps my phone safe. color as pictured."
-1,WAY too difficult figuring out how to use the product.  I've essentially abandoned the product and wrote it off as a failed experiment.
1,"Fits my Samsung 5 perfectly, and is roomy."
1,all in all works well. Sometimes clarity is a problem but for the most part it works well
-1,"Charger worked well while it lasted, after about a month of use it stops working and iPhone 6+ says the wire is not compatible with phone for charging..."
1,Best value for price!
1,Worked much better than expected at this price. Especially the clear pictures with the macro lens are a delight!
1,Fast and very accurate
-1,I got a two pack and neither screen would stick down along the rounded edges of watch screen.
1,Does what it is supposed to do.
0,"Worked decently well for the first couple months, but took too long to charge with solar power from the beginning. Seeing these other people say that it takes 3-4 hours to charge with solar power is shocking to me! Also, after three months of conservative use, one of the USB ports detached and completely came out with my USB cable. Thankfully it has two ports for a USB cable so I'm backed up. It charged my phone really well but these other shortcomings would prevent me from buying one of these again."
1,So much easier to hear on the iPhone using this. Nice find.
1,"Amazing product, will buy this over any other glass protector"
1,"I was a little concerned about the quality of this band after reading the reviews.  So far, the band is great.  I installed perfectly and the quality of the leather and buckle are nice.  I was a little worried about the length of the band, wondering whether I'd have enough band to tuck into the loop when buckled.  I was using the 3rd hole from the end of the sport band that came with the watch.  Turns out the new leather band is plenty long and I'm using the 5th hole from the end, so there is a good 1.5&#34; of band to tuck into the loop.  I'd definitely give this product a try, especially given the price compared to the Apple band."
1,Great Product
1,This is my second purchase of this product. I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4. I accidently dropped my phone face down on concrete and several other times without anything cracking. The first break to this glass cover was a direct hit from the corner of a cement counter top. It hit the top edge and made a chip in the cover. I left it in place because it was minor damage and barely noticeable. This did compromise the integrity of the screen protector and I did get several more cracks in it over the next 3 months from more drops/bangs. I finally decided it had too many cracks and needed replaced so I bought another one. Installation is a breeze and the fit is great. I like how shiny it is. Much cheaper than repairing a phone or replacing the cracked screen. I highly recommend this product.
1,Works great.  Only concern was the magnetic affect on the phone.  I took a chance and a few months later all well.  It works perfect.  I love it.
1,Fit perfectly! Highly recommended!
1,"For the price (I paid $12 for a 4-pack), these cant be beat. They seem to be standard quality, not as heavy duty as the Amazon branded cables, but they're decent and do the job and at $3 apiece, I'm quite happy with them."
1,"Delivered on time.... Clean, fully charged, very happy"
1,My daughter loves it. Protects really good.
1,Hanging on my Emma Fox bag as jewelry.So cute .Very sparkly.His little tail wiggles.Love him.
1,This cover is amazing. It lasted with for about a year and it protected the phone so much. Love it . Great for the price.
1,"I was iffy when ordering this product, but i like the minimalism of it and decided to give it a shot. It holds my iphone 5s very well and i have no worries of it falling. On issue is that since it is on the air vent, it does block the air flow since the phone is in the way. Other than that, I have no experienced anything bad about the item and have recommended it to others!"
-1,It broke with less then a month of use while holding a gps going down a smooth paved road. Waste of money.
1,Works perfectly sounds great. However something I didn't know was that if you start to get static put your phone on airplane mode.
1,These are great.
-1,"As is typical, these barely work.  I got what I paid for."
1,"My daughter is in love with her lil gadgets headset..we purchased the pink ones and had a little technical issues the second day of use, contacted lil gadgets and Jason was excellent in helping resolve the issue and best customer service I've experienced in a long time..unlike other customers the sound is perfect it works off my child's volumn controls..the fit is snug and perfect they can even fit my 8 years old head and go right back being snug on my 3 year old...I would recommend easily to anyone and actually plan on purchasing more for our other 3kids for our upcoming road trip.."
1,Perfect fit. Compliments from everyone
1,It's great once you learn how to use it.
1,Fits controllers well
1,"Great Product, speedy delivery, NO PROBLEMS!"
1,Very Happy
0,The case was great... Just the screen protector had a fold in and couldn't use it.
1,Excellent
-1,"Awful, awful, awful! I used twice! I went on a jet ski tour and it kept my phone safe and secure for my trip BUT when i opened it after the trip, I couldn't reseal it to use it again....What a tremendous disappointment! This happened conveniently after the 30 day return policy had just ended! What a waste!"
1,Fits very well!
1,"My phone charges super fast when connected to this in my truck. Not sure if it's a product of this device, or the power coming from the truck, or both, but I highly recommend it."
1,The screen protector was very easy to apply.  If you don't have a good case it does lift if your rough with your phone. Overall it's a good product and I would purchase it again
-1,"the rubber case it too big, so the outer shell &#34;hard case&#34; cannot be used with it.  It is a so-so design, truly not perfect."
1,My daughter loves it
1,it works awesome
-1,"Beautiful concept, not at all practical though. The audio port is too narrow to fit any jack, considering drilling it out. The jigsaw like piece that fits the two halves together is flimsy in design and would be best glued together once you've committed to the case."
1,Pretty good quality. About the sound you would expect from this price but no problems with it at all.
1,I can wear this all day.  Love the way this bluetooth fits!  This is my second one since I lost my first one.
1,Received this product for review. Great charger. I really like that it is 6 feet long. Its perfect for laying in bed if you don't have an outlet close to your bed. I noticed it seemed to charge faster than other cords that I have bought off of amazon. Overall I think this is a great prodcut!
1,Sleet and handsome design make this case a winner for all. Love the way if fit had no issues at all.
0,clip broke as soon as it was caught on the table so I do not have a workable holster
1,Good price for a good case
1,this case is truly beautiful. will recommend to other friends
1,"Had the case for two days now and so far so good, it fits nice and snug on my S4 and though it may not be as sturdy as my OtterBox it is less bulky."
-1,Did not like these one ear was louder then the other did not stay in my ear
-1,really bad sound quality.
0,Very amusing to play with.....got serval compliments. Gave it 3 stars because it's not as protected as I thought...also not all the liquid fits in the little compartment....the case also scratches VERY easy....you can't see it unless you really look at it but noticable...haven't even dropped it just from getting in out of my pocket.....
1,Product as described with good instructions and easy application.
1,I really love these chargers! I was looking for something very long to allow for plenty room to move while charging. The covering on the wire is like a paracord type wrapping which provides a feeling of strength. The end that plugs into the ipad is very flexible without bending to break wires within.
1,just what I wanted
1,"4 stars and not 5 because the watch gets to my hands 16 days later but, its attached perfect with my iphone very good watch!!"
0,The arm can be a little awkward and it sometimes drops if the phone is too heavy.
0,"Better than most, though the edging on the leather has already begun to come off (just on the magnetic strap).  I enjoy it and it's probably the best value for the money, but if you find a better quality one, go with that."
-1,Terrible!!!!!!  You cant see the screen if the sun is shining.  I had to reset it so many times because it would go blank or freeze.  It was so aggravating.  If my child wouldnt have thrown away the box It would be sent back ASAP
1,very pleased with this  product. i purchased this cover from a different company in pink. great protection and very durable
1,Love them
1,Holds a credit card and drivers license perfectly!  Seemed a little stiff to slide at first but once used a few times it is fine.
1,Was worried would be a bit bulky but it's no bigger than my old lifeproof case. Would recommend.
1,I found to be great to have when walking
1,This is a phenomenal case! I bought this to replace a case that was not able to handle my headphones. This case has solved that difficulty and it’s very thin yet constructed to protect the Galaxy S6 with none of the bulk.<br /><br />I got a glass screen protector and I feel more secure as long as it doesn’t fall in a river. Additionally I love the clear color.
-1,I HATE THE FACT THAT THIS THING ISNT DURABLE! ITS CUTE AND CONVIENT BUT DOESNT LAST LONG
1,"Just amazing!!!! I need it to protect my new note 5 and man! it does its job, I a little bulky, but, better than other cases.<br />great product and affordable price."
1,Pretty and protects!!
1,This is the best Bluetooth I've ever bought it lasts hours and u don't even feel it
-1,Despite being listed as a hard case - this case is not worth the price. Even if it was $2 at 5Below it would be overpriced. The &#34;hard&#34; case aspect does not even stay snapped shut without an iPod in it. Drop it from even the smallest height and it will crack. Not worth it. Pretty but it's going back.
1,"This w=is a great case. It's clear but protects the phone well. Got a quick delivery, on Sunday even."
-1,No appreciable increase in signal strength
1,Thank you
-1,"First, your phone will be safe, and if it works, the pics will be fine.<br />That being said, here are all the problems I've had with this selfie stick:<br />1. Sometimes it doesn't connect to my phone. After turning the bluetooth and the selfie stick on and off various times, it might connect after at least five minutes. I've had other people use it, and on some phones it works okay, but other phones have the same problem. All phones tested were iPhones.<br />2. The &#34;stick&#34; doesn't slide well when I open/close it. There's too much friction, and even putting some WD 40, it's not smooth, or it won't open all the way.<br />3. The rubber part on the handle isn't even attached to the stick, so it keeps turning/moving and the button for you to take the picture gets misaligned with the rubber cover.<br />Overall, it's just terrible. I would have paid $5 more for a better quality one.<br />UPDATE:<br />4. I opened the selfie stick again, and it just came apart. Look at the picture.<br />UPDATE 2:<br />Nexcon has contacted me and offered a new product or a full refund."
1,"very nice clear picture. A bit difficult to run the wires, but camera works well on my 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited"
1,It will protect your phone from numerous dangers and fits in your pocket easily. Easily recommend to a friend
-1,It did not properly fit my phone.  The hole for the camera does not line up.  It also did not stick well and was removed after the first week.
1,"Clear image but four stars since you cant really set it on top of the dashboard as the image will be upside down when you review it.  It has to be mounted on the windshield for proper image view.  Bumped up to 4 since I actually use it, clear image, and has survived a month in the Texas summer heat and the vendor contacted me asking for a more favorable review  but my original intent was for it to be mounted on the dash, not the windshield and there is no setting to reverse the image."
1,This cell phone case is just perfect for the LG Ultimate 2.  The gold backing is good protection and looks elegant on the phone.  The black hard rubber case provides good protection and keeps the phone from slipping out of your hand.  I would buy this case again and highly recommend it.
1,"I never carry a purse any more - it's great!  This is my third one (for third phone upgrade), and except for the limited color selections I couldn't be happier."
1,I absolutely love my vivo fit 2. It makes me more mindful of the exercise I do during my day. I love seeing the calories I burn. Such an insentive.
1,I was concerned about this product being flimsy and poorly made just because of how thin it appeared to be. I was wrong! I've had it on my phone for a few months now and it is fantastic! They look so late and not oversized while being adorable at the same time. I purchased the black one and teal as well.
-1,when i first received the case i thought it was cute but i have not even had this case for a week and the black on it is already fading. its a piece of junk.
-1,Did noot work
1,"Just as described, no defects whatsoever! Will buy from you again!"
1,Great case
1,Excelent! !!!
0,It's ok
1,Love the color combo..
1,"Nice Case, fits well and looks good."
-1,The box was cracked and chip
-1,"This product is an example of the &#34;get what you pay for&#34; mantra.<br /><br />It broke after the second use, but I was able to repair with a silicone adhesive.<br />The remote clicker was worthless....but we had a remote from a different Bluetooth device.<br /><br />Meh. Buy if you like DIY fixing."
1,"Super cute, and I find myself using the card slots more often.  Kinda wish it had an ID pocket, but the pen is nice. Has made video surfing easier as it works as a great stand.  But mainly the design makes it an A for me!"
1,"So far, so good. So many apple chargers I have purchased (including the ones directly from apple) either don't work, or burn out in a few days. This one has been good so far and for the price I don't care if I have to replace it."
1,It's charge 50% of the cell phone battery which it's good
1,"Love this phone case. I originally bought it to protect my phone while I found a more &#34;permanent&#34; case. But I ended up loving it so much, I never got another case. Slim and fits perfectly."
1,This one is working so far!! Had to send one back!! I love it!! Fingers crossed this one will keep working
1,Great case at a great price.
-1,The gold back part popped off now it's just black rubber. I actually like it better this way. The gold part of case is very thin and scratches easily. It looked old and beat up in just a few weeks.
1,Love being able to add some fashion to my fitbit.
1,"The reading light arrived even sooner than expected, and works just fine. I had read a review that said it was too bright, but I didn't find that at all.  It even has two settings, both of which provide enough light.  I'm a little concerned that the expense of batteries will be a problem, but we'll have to see.  The light is on a wand that can be bent to any angle, so that is very good."
1,Great product.  Fast shipper
1,"This case is great! I purchased 4 & they all work properly. 3 were tested (4th one was a gift not sure how it's being used) & not one leak. You just gotta keep an eye out for drops of water that can fall in the case if you don't dry it completely before opening it. The whole having to put an iPhone 6 plus in upside down thing isn't even a big deal because you generally go to use your phone like that anyways. The lanyard on one did break but it's such a long lanyard that tying it off works just fine. Other wise, it's a great product & definitely worth your money. The pictures are clear as day & if I had gone underwater with it, the pictures would probably deliver as well (just got this so I wouldn't have to worry about water around my phone not necessarily as something to turn my phone into a go pro or something xP)."
1,I love it.
-1,Do not buy
1,good working car charger I have used it only twice seems to be doing its job
-1,Sound quality is terrible and evidently the mic is too. People can't understand what I'm saying. Wish I could say it was worth the low price but it isn't. I give it two stars because technically it does do what is supposed to and pairs easily enough.
-1,"wast of my time and money, did not work"
1,"I will admit that I am a Spigen fan. They make the thinnest profile cases for all things Apple. Before i received this case i carried my phone naked but the camera protruding on the back made me rethink that. Enter the Spigen Thin Fit case. The cutouts line up perfectly and the case covers the sides, back and extends just a bit onto the corners. The sides of this case comes right up to the edge of where the body and the screen meet. This allowed me to use a screensaver that covers the complete screen including the curves. Minimal increase in size and works very well. Great case."
1,"I have had it quite a while and the image still looks great.  Though covered, I have not had any trouble using the buttons."
-1,Crap...cheaply made....had scratches on it and it only cobers the back and sides.  Provides no protection for the screen like a case is suppose to do.  In fact it is not a case just a shell.  Do not buy!
1,it's literally perfect
1,I love  jl audio makes good amps
1,The sub is everything it says it is I have it bridged to be 2 ohms and its getting at least 500watts rms the sub can move some serious air but if you want to sustain really low notes make sure your enclosure is rated down that low and you will get great results
1,"Tablets, phones, MP3 players, fitness bands... I can think of a dozen devices we regularly need to charge. Instead of having charging blocks scattered throughout the house, we now have a central charging location. Power IQ is a huge bonus. Devices always charge as fast as with their original chargers. No longer waiting twice as long for a tablet to charge because you can't locate the right charging block. I don't think any device takes more than 2 hours to fully charge, so we've been able to rotate devices through and share cables.If there's any buyer's remorse, it's that we didn't get more ports."
-1,The plastic part of the case didn't fit with the silicone on the phone! Biggest waste ever!
1,Nicely made case. Fits perfect.
1,Fits great without adding bulk.
1,First off can I just say how well fit this case is? Btw this is an honest and unbiased review. It's as if it was made during the production of the iPhone 6 Plus! It does not add any bulk at all in my opinion. The volume buttons and sleep button are easy to push that's why I say the case is definitely well made for this phone. I also like how the inside is lined with felt to protect from scratches. The soft feel on outside of case is very smooth but not slippery. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who needs protection but don't want a bulky case.  Maxboost customer service:  They are excellent. Very professional and if you have a problem they will solve it right away. Customer service is very important which is why I gave five stars.
1,Have had it for months and no issues like the many others I have bought.
-1,Belt clip broke already.  Sleeve that the phone slips in is very durable.
1,Great Product!!! fast Shipping!!
1,I'm very satisfied.
1,"Late delivery, but as advertised."
-1,Blocks part of the screen from being used or viewed
1,Just what I needed.  Works great.  Excellent purchase
0,"As it was free I can't complain much however I am unable to plug in my charger or earphones completely with the case on. Also, the back is clear if you were unable to tell from the preview image."
-1,"The handle has already broke and it looks like good quality on line, but it very cheap plastic. It worked for a couple of weeks and the art is very cute, but not at all a good buy."
-1,Blew in the first month complete crap!
-1,"Since my wife liked the design(5 stars), I bought two cases in a short period of time due to the 1st was cracked. The 2nd one was also cracked within a week of arrival. (-3 Stars)<br />... Highly not recommend this item."
1,This is my second Otter Box I really like the way they hold up.
1,Satisfied
1,"Great product, price and service!"
1,"Fit well and looks very nice.  It's very thin, so may not protect iPhone well, especially when it's dropped.  But I know it before I purchased it, so not complaining."
1,"product worked as advertised, easy installation. I was even able to remove the glass and reapply it to a new phone after a warranty replacement."
-1,Quality is not good and its too big.
-1,The case cracked easily whenever I would take it off. Its hard to access few letters when I was texting or trying to close out certain ads. The picture I would take was rather blurry
1,Is very high quality and looks exactly like photo!!
1,The solemate met my expectations. Decent sound and volume for close quarters.
1,I just love the new new case . I would highly recommend it. The color is beautiful! Very sturdy but still streamlined.
1,"I loved this product when I got it, the look, the leather, and the color.  However, after two months the leather began to shred around the edges and the magnet for the closure fell out.  Needless to say, I have to order another case.  I would only recommend using this case if you will not use it to hold our credit cards or cash.  I think that the more items you put in the billfold part, the less sturdy the case becomes.  I am giving it four stars because it was good while it lasted!"
1,"Finally found something that is quick, convenient and not bulky. Highly recommemd."
1,"Pros:<br />-These work great for Quick Charge compliant chargers.<br />-Higher quality than most cheap USB cables. Sturdy. Faster charging from thicker gauge wire.<br />-Inexpensive<br /><br />Cons:<br />-None<br /><br />I have replaced all of my old cables with Aukey, Anker, and Tronsmart cables (same OEM) because they work so much better and last longer."
-1,the side of it cracked within a couple days
1,Great antenna. Perfect replace of stock antenna
1,"Great, works very well."
1,Very nice for the price. Has good sound and can be very loud.
1,"Great case...sturdy, durable and good looking. Very pleased."
1,Very happy with product
1,work well
-1,"This thing crapped out really early and when I went to get my new one under warranty, the website wasn't even there. Don't buy"
1,Great product.
1,So surprised by how good the sound is.  I was a little worried due to the low price but very happy with it and bought another one for my daughter.
1,"While I do love the quick charge 2.0 and the price is right....the only thing I do not like is the charging block, it's bulky and takes up at least 2 slots on my extension cord. Other than that, it's perfect"
1,So far it's still sticking. Gtmat seems to be made right. Price and quality. What more could I ask for
1,"Does the job nicely - keps the phone dry, and hangs around the neck while out on the kayak - bright enough to use as a signaling device if necessary. Well made."
1,"Awesome phone.  Spyware/malware comes pre-loaded though.  If you don't mind having to root your phone and going into developer mode, than this is a great phone, especially for the price.  This phone competes well with Zen-Phone II, one plus one, and all other unlocked phones.  This phone is sweet. Everybody will be asking where you got it, with that bright yellow.  Also, 4g does not work with t-mobile in the United States.  I heard the 4g works with the AT&T."
1,Its a very nice protector
1,Nice product.
1,It's a great case. It feels like I put no cover on my phone. Keep it slim!
-1,it charges slow
1,I just got this item. It came within a couple days of ordering which is nice. It seems very durable! So far so good.
1,"This really works!  Has been a lifesaver, especially during recent multiple day power outage in our area!  I bought one for me and my husband and we were able to charge our phones several times.  I just recommended it to a friend and he is going to buy one too!"
1,"Everything about this portable battery is great. It's packaged and feels like high-end electronic without the high-end price. It's solid and performs great, we tested it out by charging both of our Moto X's overnight. The next day it still had all 3 of its battery level lights on, can't wait to see how many charges we can get out of it on our phones before we need to plug it in again!<br /><br />Speaking of lights, this thing has a flashlight function as well! I had no idea this was a feature until I'd already ordered it and having since tried it out, it's a great little feature that will be handy on our next camping trip."
-1,It's to small not worth it
1,Perfect fit
1,I love this case! I am easily able to slide my cards in and out.
-1,"I Have had these headphones for just over a month now and almost like clockwork, both pairs I ordered have started to malfunction. Neither were great to begin with and I probably should have returned them straight away but time slipped by I was uncertain if my kids would like these or not. In any case, here are my complaints.<br />1 - Unless you sit DIRECTLY in front of the transmitter on your unit, you get static. Anything more than 15 degrees off center and static starts to creep in.<br /><br />2 - The volume level on these are not loud at all. We own a van which has an average amount of road noise however, at full volume, these are not lous enough for me or my kids to block out even very quiet noises. I can only turn the car radio on to about 1-2 for my wife and I while the kids use these otherwise they say that can't hear and ask us to turn down the radio. I tried it myself and they were right.<br /><br />3. - For the 30 minutes I tested these headphones, I noticed the ear foam pads were thin and irritating. I think for a longer movie I would be bothered by soreness."
1,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
1,Great screen protector!
1,Case is slim and provides enough protection
1,Amazing band. Great band for the apple watch sports space grey. Fits perfectly and looks great. One minus point was that it was very hard to resize even with the tools it came with. Recommend this though as its fairly cheap!
1,It's more beautiful than I expected! !!!! Made the right choice
1,very nice product would buy again
1,My husband loves this case!
1,"Better quality than the originals, extremely happy with color selection and quality"
1,"I had been using another VERY popular case, but the plastic at the bottom kept breaking when i was pulling the phone out of my pocket.  This one is much more robust in the bottom, and has the same look, feel, and function as the other one except the back is plastic instead of the rubber.  My other case was wrapped in rubber with just a plastic ring around the edging.  This one is wrapped in rubber with a complete plastic backing and some on the sides.  It is much less prone to breaking.  Bonus, my phone actually looks like an iPhone with this case too.  haha  I am happy."
-1,It's already breaking apart the plastic that goes around the phone is cracked and chipping apart. Will not purchase one of these again
1,"I like it..it works as it is designed, which is all one can ask for!"
1,Excellent product. Thanks!
1,"Big fan of this case - so much so that we've ordered 3; just because the plastic screen gets scratched from use. I've dropped my phone from my lifted jeep with this case and it was totally fine. I like it because it's very light weight and compact but protects as well, if not better, as an Otterbox case. We'll continue to order this case as long as it's available."
1,Does exactly what it advertised.  Plugs into my Jabra Pro headset base and turns on when I remove the headset from the base.  I work from my home do people can know not to walk into my office when I'm on a call.
0,Was advertised as fitting a 2003 Expedition but it did not fit mine.  Plug size was wrong.  Not a problem with the item but with the description of what it is for.
1,"Works as designed. Nothing flashy, but holds my Samsung Galaxy S4 well."
-1,Its a 50/50 chance that the microphone will work. All the blue colors that i bought had non-functioning microphones.
1,"Shipped fast, came with a resealable pouch to protect it, works great."
1,I bought this for my tablet because I keep score for on it for my daughters travel softball team.  This gives me added protection from the elements.  The on issue I noticed is that on the hot days I do get an over heat warning from the tablet- but I feel that is ok because it did not shut down on me and my thoughts were the case really does seal my tablet in good
1,Love this stuff.  Cant live without it.  Gives just the right touch of color and smells good too.
1,Good case
1,Love this case!  I work at a phone store so. Wing able to have the second brand as we sell in the store was a big deal for me. It showed up on time and works amazingly with my phone!
-1,"It took one week before it started to short out at the phone end. You could send us another cord and i'll see of that was a fluke, otherwise, I will look into sending it back."
1,beautiful;
1,"For the price, it is well worth it. I've only used this for a few weeks, but I haven't had any problems. The size of the &#34;encasement&#34; over the base of the plug is small enough to fit my iPhone, which is protected by a bumper. This is a huge plus, since cables of other brands, e.g., Belkin, are not as conservative when it comes to the size of the adapter end. I also appreciate that the cable is more rigid than conventional cables, i.e., it doesn't get twisted and caught up in stuff when I'm moving my iPhone around on my desk or in my car. This is a minor point, but with typical cables it is as irritating as wrapping up a garden hose. Unless something negative happens in the future, I would definitely buy this product again."
1,I love my little cardbuddy. It's easy to apply and very convenient. All my friends want one now too. I just wish it was black to match my case but other than that I'm very satisfied with it.
1,Great for my purpose.  I have a Harley Road Glide.  I don't need a very long cable to plug it into my motorcycle so it works perfectly!  I wouldn't hesitate buying this if you are in the market for a short lightning cable.
1,"Its slightly heavy and adds size to your phone, but nothing is breaking your phone with this case on it!! It would be better if the allen key needed was packaged on the outside though. Otherwise perfect case!!"
1,It's great !
-1,"cheaply made, the &#34;crystal scratched from gently wiping it with a clean t-shirt."
0,Great Quality cord... stopped charging my phone after 2 weeks.
1,Very good product!
1,"Bought two of these, one for each car - I love that I have so many options and that it securely holds my Note 4 with a heavy duty case!  One of the vent clips did break about a week after Amazon's return window was up...contacted the company and received a replacement part in less than a week with no hassle of having to send anything back."
1,Great product! My second one !
0,"The product works very well. however, after having it for nearly a month, the iPhone input cuts in and out during charging. in doing so, I have to tilt the iPhone a specific way so that it charges.<br /><br />6.5/10. would recommend, but needs some adjusting."
1,excellent
1,Phone fits perfect and looks good
-1,"I was expecting the case to be all black with floral print and it ended up being navy and black and warped, so it doesn't even fit my phone right."
1,Product as described fast shipping
1,Seems to be just fine but it is not a true Apple cord.
-1,doesnt do a great job. my screen cracked.
1,Good case
-1,"looks awful and scratched up immediately, but at least it's the case being scratched and not my phone."
1,Works as advertised but it does not accomodate very large batteries like the Posh 7&#34; phone has.  Very good deal for the $5 tag.
1,"I've had this watch for a little over a month now, and let me say this thing is awesome. Android Wear allows me to easily view my notifications and respond to texts without having to pull my phone out, and when its raining, thats a very nifty thing. setting reminders is super quick and simple, as well as setting things like timers and alarms.<br />The battery gets me all the way through the day (I haven't tried the ambient settings as the &#34;lift to turn on&#34; works just fine for me), and I can charge it while i'm in the shower before I go to bed so I can use it with Sleep as Android to track my sleeping habits. the cradle charges the watch really quickly too which is very nice.<br />i've more than once accidentally scraped the glass on something, but have yet to have any scratches on any part of the watch.<br />the screen has a great set of brightness levels and is still mostly readable in direct sun, although not as easy as traditional watches<br /><br />the only con here I have, would be the leather strap. I love the grey color, and it feels pretty great, but if I sweat or get it wet it tends to leave a slight discoloring on my wrist which washes away with a good scrubbing. also, the leather strap soaks up sweat and smells pretty nasty. I would certainly suggest buying a metal watch strap from your local jeweler or online. Because they made it use the standard watch strap size so its easy to find an alternative, i'm not dropping a star for this very minuscule issue"
1,"I read all the reviews and the issues about echo and I have not experienced any issues with it.  If you are on the road like I am and you can use a device like this when at a client site or in your hotel, you can't go wrong.  Just get it.  The volume range is great and using it is very easy."
1,LOVED IT
1,GOOD PRODUCTS
1,Super cute case. I've gotten. Lots of compliments on it. It's thin and comfortable. Not sure it protects much but still worth the buy.
0,Finding the charge location is kind of a pain in the butt on the phones that you have and always having to push a button to get it to start charging is frustrating as well but it works
1,Love it.
1,"This cable works better than my wall charger.<br /><br />Once the cable gets plugged into the car charger, it's very hard to get out. I don't mean it's impossible. I mean to say it's PRETTY FIRM<br /><br />The material itself is plastic. It looks like any other charger but once you plug everything, you feel the difference. It's worth of your money.<br /><br />Also, if you get the cable and connect to your wall charger, it's gonna work just as fine"
-1,I have had the glass on for 2 weeks now and it is lifting up all around the edges
-1,It works but does not fit 2000 tacoma
1,"I can't tell you how many screens i have cracked previously, it's happened at least twice on every phone i've ever owned, and i also have an infant that likes to play with my phone and drop it also, and since i decided to try this out, NOT ONE SCRATCH! everything is still in great condition, should have tried this a long time ago!"
1,"Ok, yes, it's cheap in price. What it isn't though, is cheap in quality. I read the reviews of this mount and several others before deciding to trust a reviewer who said he used this in his jeep off-roading. It does exactly as it says. It holds onto that phone and doesn't move or drop it. There are wheels for adjusting the angle and grip. You can use the sticky adhesive or you can use the suction cup. I use the suction cup and it's never moved from my dash. Granted I don't drive off road but I feel it would still hold onto my iPhone. I don't think it can fit an iPhone 6 Plus in a thick case but then again I didn't try that."
1,"Easy to install, great clear screen.  good fit."
1,Got this for my brother for his S6. He loves it.
1,Only case I have truly loved. The stand is great. Form factor is slim. Basic protector works well.
1,"Excellent USB port, small enough and well designed to sit on my desk, so no more diving under the desk to plug or unplug cables from the system.."
1,great product!  Keeps the charge for a long time and the sound quality is great.  Highly recommend!
-1,Fits phone great but the loop in breaks. I have gone though three. They last for about 4 or 5 months.
1,Another great product.  All ports in use and all my devices charge at their fullest. Just killing it with quality mobile accessories.
1,"Awesome case I like it it makes the phone a little heavier but other than that is great. Looks good, protects the phone well, fits perfectly I do recommend"
1,It is charging-really nice .
-1,It does not provide enough power for iPad. I am disappointed
1,Lovely case. I love that it's slim and has the shock absorption edges
1,"Already my favorite speaker. It's easy to use, can be taken practically anywhere, and has awesome sound quality for its size. It beats out any other device in my home for streaming music. The rubber band on the sides can be annoying since it pulls away from the speaker at the edges and NudeAudio's customer support leaves a lot to be desired when communicating with them, but overall the speaker itself is pretty awesome."
1,"It's entertaining, not frustrating."
-1,Nice quality but as others mentioned the top of the clip digs into your side and is uncomfortable. I find myself not using it because of this.
1,This is a fun case.  It's like have a wallet with you.
-1,Nothing like expected
1,No more blue tooth for us!  This is better for your health and works great!
-1,"After 1 month of use, it's reacting very slow. Also observed sound is very low while talking on the phone. And now people are complaining that they are unable to here my voice properly. Oh my god it's sucking....."
1,Works good some voice distortions with a low voice
-1,The case arrived later than expected. I really like that the case is sleek and not too bulky but the rubberized part is so stiff that it makes it almost impossible to press any of the phones buttons.
1,"My phone is older and I could not find a case for it at the mall or the T Mobile store.  I found this case online, and it fits perfectly and I love the little kickstand that allows me to stand my phone on a flat surface to read/watch something online.  The screen saver was not sticky enough to adhere to the phone, though, so I had to throw it out.  Love the case, though."
1,love them so much I ordered a second set!
1,Works Google
1,very good product
1,Works for me
1,Awesome case for the price!
0,It's a factory battery.  Better work right ;)
1,Great item. Holds my IPhone 6 with a case.
-1,Very poor quality. It does not work. I threw away packaging. So I am not sure how to return it
1,Thank you
1,Excellent
1,Excellent just what I ordered
1,"These screen protectors are some of the best I've ever used.<br /><br />It was easy to apply the screen protector using the instructions and applicators that were included, and I didn't end up with a single air bubble once it was completed. It's a lot better quality than most I've purchased on Amazon in the past. I can tell it won't need to be replaced for a long time. The anti-glare and anti-liquid features work as advertised.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying from iCarez again in the future."
1,The seller did exactly what they said they would. I have already dropped my phone on concrete since I have had this case and it protected it like it should.
1,for only $10 vat go wrong luv this
1,"Great case, looks nice and protects my phone really well. The rubber used feels soft and doesn't get dirty easily like other rubber cases."
1,nice~
1,Great alternative to the very pricey Apple version. I have had it for a few weeks now and I love it. Easy to adjust to fit and works great when at the gym.
-1,Jawbone gave me this to replace my two UP24s that they replaced every 6 months as they kept breaking. UP2 just doesn't work or do the job it's supposed to do. It doesn't stay on the wrist. It is now lost. It also doesn't track steps or sleep all the time. Just when it chose too.
-1,Not it did not meet my expectations. When you put your phone in the holster it turns the volume of your phone down ALL the way. Not impressed with my purchase at all.
-1,"It is of high quality but it suffers from the same issue as all the other Note 5 tempered glass screen protectors I have tried so far: halo effect. The edges all along the screen protector do not adhere to the display and are lifted, creating a bubble, or &#34;halo&#34;, effect."
0,"This product will not work if the vehicle is a manual transmission, it is in the way of the gear shifter."
-1,Seems sturdy but the case covers the audio input.
1,works with plus and regular model
1,It works.
1,Love this power!
1,"Worked perfectly, when I used the charging cord that came with it. That cord is quite short, so I tried using another mini USB, but it did not charge correctly.<br />However, during long days, this adds the charge I need and does it well."
-1,The case broke after a week.
1,It is a case. Nothing special. It appears to be well constructed and will serve the purpose.
1,"Arrived as promised, love it, great case and the shatter proof glass worked great, real easy to apply!"
1,N-a
1,"These headphones were a great purchase.  I have small ears and few headphones of this style fit me well.  These have a lot of accessory pieces that helped get it properly sized.  They stay snugly fit, no matter the activity level. They also have a better range than I anticipated."
1,It works as a waterproof case very well. The only problem I had with the case was the mute switch broke and the people were nice enough to send me a replacement case which didn't work either. But it's a good case. The people gave me a full refund. The only problem was the mute switch.
0,super fast shipping...speaker volume lacking...not sure if because it's a refurb.
1,Good phone case. Easy to put together and take apart. Easy cleaning.
1,Excellent condition
1,I love my case!!! It's very well made
1,"The first thing I want to mention is that this review is not for the above mentioned device but it is for the other Argon rectangle shaped speaker. The one I am reviewing is this…<br />Argon® Bluetooth Wireless Portable Stereo 2CH Speaker for all iPhone, iPod, iPad, Blackberry, Android smartphones and MP3 players. Rechargeable built-in battery [Red]<br /><br />Due to some amazon goofup, I received this rectangle speaker.<br />I love having a bluetooth speaker around which we can use say inside the car or even at home. Or when you go to beach or someplace. The argon speaker we are talking about here is a rectangular shaped bluetooth portable 2 channel speaker. The reason it is mentioned 2 Channel is because it internally has 2 small speakers and both provide a maximum output of 3W RMS per speaker. If you buy a single speaker like those circular or cube shaped ones, they usually have single 3W speaker inside, while this has 2. This way you can achieve stereo sound quality.<br /><br />If you look at the body of the speaker, it will look like small and big sized blocks arranged in some fashion. On top of the speaker, you have 3 buttons for telephone, plus and minus.<br />On the front of the speaker is the same pattern but you have a mesh sort of design with “Argon” logo on the left side. On the very right bottom is the LED light which is visible only when you are charging the speaker or it is turned on. It will turn red when you are charging it and turn blue once fully charged. When paired, it will blink blue light.<br /><br />The 3 buttons on the top of the speakers are for..<br />--Volume Up and Down<br />--Track Next and Previous<br />--Music Pause / Lift Call / Hangup<br /><br />Yes the same buttons have multiple functions. When you are playing music, if you press the volume buttons once and rapidly, it will increase or decrease the volume. While if you keep it pressed, it will change the track. The middle button with handset embossing is used for pausing themusic. When in a call, it is used to hangup the call.<br /><br />On the right side of the speaker is the charging port which is MicroUSB Connector. You have a Aux In available as well so you could connect a 3.5mm connector and use the bluetooth speaker as a non bluetooth one. There is a ON/OFF Switch as well. When you turn on the speaker, it will “speak” to you. Yes it says “Hello”. This may freak people initially. There is no tone etc, it will speak stuff. Like when pairing is done, it will say “You phone is now connected” and such.<br /><br />The volume of the speaker is independent to the volume of the device connected. This means that you can have very loud sound. The sound from the speaker is pretty decent and people should look at the price and set their expectations. Don’t expect a LG UE Boombox or Bose level sound here. For casual listening it is pretty good. The bass is Ok but many a times I felt that sound was tearing especially at higher volume. Overall I would rate ⅘ on the sound quality.<br /><br />The speaker will be shown as “Argon SP28” on your phone etc. Also I don’t know why but on my iPhone, I could not get the battery level display on the status bar. This usually works with most battery operated bluetooth speakers. These have 1000mAh battery inside it which is pretty good and manufacturer claim is around 9 Hours of battery but I am sure that is at a decent volume and not full blast.<br /><br />Inside the box you are will get the MicroUSB cable and 3.5mm cable. Overall decent enough speakers for the price and deliver a good value.<br />*I received this product in exchange of a honest and unbiased feedback and all opinions are based on my usage with the product."
1,This is a very good card and is appropriately priced. I have several games storied in one convent place.
1,"Replaced my aging and unreliable GO PRO 2 with the Virb.  Didn't want to spend $400 on a new &#34;HERO&#34;.  Use it primarily for motorcycle track days.  It takes excellent video, and it is tough.  Unfortunately I crash tested it last month and it still works great.  Check out Youtube, type in<br /> creepy 847, and find JimC crash."
-1,Received item and what a piece of crap. The image on the back is all blurry... looks like it was poorly laser scanned on there or something. The case does NOT fit the phone properly. What a waste of money.
1,great
0,Product works fine while it lasted but the belt clip wasn't very durable..
-1,Do not purchase this item it is a waste of money. Brought it from seller only used it a couple times. The ear piece broke in two pieces. This is reconditioned junk..
1,"From the packaging of this product to the user friendly functionality of this item is exceptional.  If you're on the go - get this stick, take explosive pics, & share them with the world!"
-1,"Really disappointed in this case. Its a cute case but the gold part kept slipping off. I only had it for about 1 week before it fell and I didn't realize it and lost the part. So this case had to go right in the trash can. I wish it would have fit the phone better. I'm disappointed that I wasted $15 for a cute case that I couldn't use anymore because the case size was wrong. And yes, I did order the right case for my phone. The length fit but the width didn't. The gold part barely clicked into place with the teal part when it arrived."
0,"Nice, thin, grippy case for iPhone, makes it a lot easier to hold and protects it from scratches and hard falls. But dust and dirt get under it pretty easily, so your phone doesn't look great."
1,good
1,Met my expectations.
-1,The ONLY tool you need to worry about is the thin wire to remove your broken screen.... two were included and both broke multiple times... if I heated my phone to the surface temperature of the sun they may have worked. I broke my digitizer trying...
0,"This device would have gotten 5 stars had the following not happened:<br /><br />1) They shipped the device 4 weeks after they said they would.<br />2) The directions on how to link the device are horribly incomplete (this should be simple... it's bluetooth).  And tthere wasn't any further information on their website describing how to get it to link to iPhone nor was anyone fielding tech support questions on their &#34;launch weekend&#34;.<br /><br />Get this, I found the answer on Amazon in user comments.<br /><br />They have a very cool product, but come on... it is simple to make useful FAQs and have someone respond to user questions on the weekend... especially the weekend you release your new product."
1,"Highly Recommended. Easy to Install, Protects my Apple Watch Edge to Edge I have bought a couple other protectors from shops. I could not install the first product and ended up damaging it. Second time, I got the shopkeeper to install it for me. It gave up on the edges after a week. I finally decided to jump on Amazon and ended up buying this brand. I am writing this review after trying this product for 4 weeks. Heres why I like it.<br />1. Unlike other protectors, the Ruby Shield protects my 38mm Watch edge to edge.<br />2. Installation is straight forward. No liquid spray and no curing time. Its a dry and easy installation. I was done in 5 minutes.<br />3. No bubbles during installation. Crystal clear view.<br />4. It hasnt failed on the edges after 4 weeks. And doesnt look like it will fail anytime soon."
0,the material is really cheap and the head phones hardly stay in the little magnet that it has to hold on. it work great just that when you put it on speaker the other person can't hear me whit the headphones which makes it difficult when i drive.
1,"Love my new OtterBox for my Galaxy s5 phone, its sturdy, with a clip on on the back, n has a locking system on it that locks into place . Awesome prouduct , OtterBox is the only case you will ever need."
0,Head Phone Cavity not big enough for most 2.5mm headphones or cables. Otherwise good
1,Very minimalist but very durable.
0,"I'm usually a big fan of skinomi products, but it seems like this time around, the tech glass wasn't that great. Very clear and feels nice when using the screen, but a little after week of use I found a slight cut on the protector. Hadn't been dropped so I guess something scratched it somehow."
1,Works great in the car. Very clean sound from my iPods
1,"I love the charging base, it is comfortable to wear. However it drops the bluetooth connection after about 15 minutes of being on a call. I know it's not my phone (Galaxy Note 4 running Kit Kat) my other headset stays connected. I got this to stay at the office and use on frequent long conference calls. Wish I kept the packaging to send it back.  UPDATE: I was sent a new headset without requesting a replacement, this one works great so I obviously had a defective one. Comfortable to wear all day and the battery makes it through the day as well even with marathon conference calls."
-1,no good
0,Wish that it fit the phone better but gets lots of attention.
1,It works quite well. An awesome product.
1,I wasn't expecting a PAL charger with a separate adapter; otherwise it was a great purchase.
1,"Great product, fast charge, it works well for my life style."
1,It's great
1,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
1,Excellent
0,Like the price and it fits but it's not charging.  I assume it's my phone but I'm gonna wait before I decide  to toss it.
1,The colour is perfect and fits into my phone. it also came with a very cute thank you card
1,Love it!
1,Exactly fits the Samsung S6 Edge. I gifted this for my mother and she loves it. There is a shortage of cases out there for the Edge and this one looks fancy and it keeps the screen clean. I would recommend buying a screen protector though just in case. It does leave your phone very vulnerable since there's no protection.
-1,These screen protectors look good but they don't fit the Fire phone exactly correct and cause issues with the phone screen. They look like they should work but with all of the camera sensors on the face of the phone they just don't work. Save your money. They look as good as any screen protector they just don't work on this phone.
1,Very happy with my order. It far exceeded my expectations! Thank you.
1,It works great. It's light and it allows for extra 2 charges of my iPhone.
-1,returned wouldnt read sim card - nothing against the model - ordered a replacement
1,Very Sturdy.
1,No exactly &#34;light weight&#34; but it's powerful. I love that I can charge it in the sun. It came in very handy when I found myself in the dark suddenly on a beautiful (& cooler) day when someone ran in to a pole and knocked us all off the grid.
1,They're so great! Not one complaint. And not one of them broke. They work on any device screen.
1,Works perfectly with our 2 USB's. Now we have a free plug for other items
0,Doesn't glow very bright
1,"Good case for phone , got it quickly."
-1,"absolute junk.  The gripper/jaw clip thing is loose and when it actually holds your phone, it  presses into the volume keys and messes with audio.  Really crappy design and not useful at all for iPhones."
1,"Works great, will provide excellent support to the Heil Broadcast boom which is big!"
1,just as described
1,wORKING FINE!  I AM HAPPY WITH IT.
1,I love my little sound pod! So simple and works so well. I love that it looks super cute even when nothing is it it too.
1,"Excellent product, sturdy and well made. Would buy again or recommend to friends."
-1,"Originally I believed this to be a good strong product.  It seemed durable and was easily attached to phone.  However, after only 1 month, the first crack in the protector appeared.  The edges started to crack as it does not  cover the whole screen of my Iphone 6 and I now have 2 other cracks.  I have ordered a replacement and will see how it does."
-1,Big Bulky and flaky.
-1,This item burnt out after two uses.  Got really hot and quit working with a burning smell.
-1,I've only owned this a short while. I've never dropped this or been rough with my case. The top corner broke off this morning. It didn't catch on anything. I am surprised how flimsy the plastic case is. Do not waste your money.
-1,"I'm giving this product a 2 because it looks great and my son loved it, but it broke in 3-days.....😏 i guess a part on the side cracked & kept getting caught going in and out his pocket!  So not a good buy😔😢 toobad because we luv the Giants!!"
1,"The iPhone 5 arrived a day earlier than expected. It looks like new. So far it has worked very well, and I'm especially pleased with the strength of the battery. My only question is regarding the 6 months warranty. There was no paperwork regarding it in the package."
1,Made a great gift.
1,It is really nice and its more convenvet
-1,This case has no support for the phone itself. It comes with a cheap plastic holder that is glued in place. The side broke off about 3days after using it and would no longer hold my phone. Good concept but wish it was made better.
1,After use for a while I don't know if by iPhone Battery get drain faster. But happy to use it. Will use it to test for a while
1,Love it
1,Fast shipping  fits perfect  and protects well
-1,Didn't fit
0,"These do not fit over the complete screen, if thats what your trying to protect. The fit from top to bottom, but not side to side. Dollar store quality, maybe seek out another brand. The seller was very good however sending these out quickly."
1,"I'm a flight attendant and always on the go. I got tired of my phone running out of charge or afraid to use it because I may need it later in the day. So I bought this one.<br /><br />The battery case is super slim, is not bulky in your pocket and seems like it's high quality.<br /><br />Some days I'm super hard on my phone with social media, texting, reading, watching movies, listing to music an so on. With most people our phones have become part of us.<br /><br />This is a day I do twice a week; Commute to or from work which is a two hour flight and using my phone constantly. Might work another 5 flights that day with phone in and out of airplane mode, one and off, checking social media, catching the news, reading a book on the kindle app and a lot more. All of this has a major drain on my battery. Now after some days 20 hours long I still have at least 50% battery life and still going strong.<br /><br />I get asked daily about this case because it does look pretty cool.<br /><br />I am beyond happy with this."
1,"Love its ease of use, flexibility, and portability. Magnet works well, even through 2 layers of rubber/plastic phone cover. I only gave it a 4 because I am not convinced the strong magnet doesn't damage my phone. After using the mount for a couple of days, my phone started acting very strangely and didn't respond to touch like it used to. However, after leaving it off the magnet and restarting, the problems were gone. I only use it as absolutely necessary anyway, since having my phone readily visible while I drive is not smart driving."
-1,it is very bad product. please do not buy this if you want somthing that you can hear and be heared.the only thing its looks nice and it hold well on the glass but as a speaker it worth NADA.
1,very good
-1,It didn't work after the first use. The battery power bank just heated up to the point that I thought it would burn my hand when I touched it.  For $5 I figured it was worth a try.
1,"I received this product with a great discount for an honest review.<br /><br />Easy to connect to my laptop and my cell phone, I was really happy with the range on these headphones. I was able to walk around almost my entire bungalow and listen to the radio streaming on the laptop.<br /><br />I did have some difficulty getting the headphones to seat in one of my ears. The device comes with several different sizing options but for whatever reason, I ended up irritating my ear before finding the optimal angle.<br /><br />The charge was quick, and lasted long enough for my cleaning session (or for a workout), and I think these are an excellent choice for bluetooth headphones intended for use for limited lengths of time."
1,"Great price,  awesome product!"
1,"Great, just what I needed and worked without any issues.  This item is exactly what you need if you have an Otterbox type case on your iPhone and need an extension to into the phone for charging, especially for those chargers that have the big square ends on them."
-1,They don't work for very long . One day for one of mine .
-1,"No good, stop working after 3 weeks."
1,Fit my Motorola Droid Razar M Well.......Good cover for the price. I will probably order another one in a different color.
1,Good phone
1,pretty and fits.
1,"here's a lot to like about this stand for Apple Watch. It's very modern and stylish. It's well-built. It's practical and convenient. It also holds an iPhone 6 or 6+, which I love very much. It slides together easily and looks great. I love it."
1,"Excellent product, product waterproof and it protects my phone when i  saw the rain. Take pictures, receive and call anytime. I no longer worry about my phone when it rains. Because, i have waterproof. Thank to seller so much!"
-1,The sides get dirty relatively quick and hard to clean
1,Fast delivery perfect fit
1,A nice slim cover for the price.  I haven't damaged my iPhone 6plus yet and really don't expect to with this simple and clean phone cover.
-1,broken in a matter of days
1,"Fits the phone perfect,nice clear picture of elvis"
1,My daughter loves this case
1,Great product with nice features.  Looks 100% like original radio  in my dad's 66 novel with some updated technology.
-1,"I have dropped my phone shortly after I purchased this screen- it cracked into multiple pieces, but the most disturbing fact was that my iPhone 6 screen cracked even more beneath it!!!"
1,Great case! We love spigen brand products! Top quality for a low price! Can't beat it!
1,Easy  fit
1,Love it. I can charge my phone 3 times.
1,"Works great with the HTC M8, iphone 6+, 5s, and ipad mini.  Plugs in smooth into the cigarette lighter adapter and stays in place."
-1,"Was under the impression that this product filters OUT blue light (i.e. it is red-colored). This is not the case. Rather, it does the exact opposite, it is blue-colored, filtering out red light. This is useless to me. Ordered this product for use on a 2DS in nightime, as there is no equivalent of https://justgetflux.com/ or https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&hl=en for the 3DS family of systems."
1,"Just got the free samples before four days.AWSOME case ! Really works.I am very pleased with this waterproof case! I cut paper towels to fit exactly to each corner and I dunked it in a jug of water with a weight on top for 1/2 hour. When I took it out the paper towels were completely dry! It comes with a lanyard to wear around your neck or attach to beach bag or whatever.<br /><br />Good for the three layers lock seal,it is very safety.I found this case to be amazing made of high quality materials and it holds many items perfectly ,it fit my phone perfectly and I was able to add cash and my debit card to it<br />It went to the beach and the pool -- never underwater because that is just not part of my lifestyle. With lots of splashing and normal exposure to that environment, my phone stayed dry. For me, that is the ultimate test, and it passed! Sample provided and I am well pleased.Highly recommended!"
1,"works great, a little hard to put on but once you get it on it works out great"
1,I purchased the Garmin Nuvi 56 to take on my next vacation flight to Florida so I thought that a case that was the exact size as the screen would be good.  Regretfully the Garmin nuvi I will not be taking it with me on any trip therefore the case is useless to me.  The problem with the case is that it does not provide space for the auto power cord therefore the value is iffy.
1,Great case for a great value
-1,My iPhone 6 Plus is too heavy for this selfie stick. I had to use tape to keep the metal rods in place so I could use it. :(
-1,"It actually broke on me,the sides split."
1,It works great.
-1,It stopped working after 3 charges!!!
1,"Yes. Yes. Yes. I've had this on my phone for almost an entire year!!! It definitely is great quality, put it on myself and no air bubbles and if you do get bubbles you can easily get them out. Not like most protectors!"
1,"best bang for your buck, really love it"
1,great product!
1,Durable and protective!!!
-1,"WAS not colorful enough and since it came from China,cannot send it back"
1,I LOVE THIS CASE! I get so much use out of it and all of my friends love it and think its so funny. It fits the ipod perfectly . I love it
1,I got this for my husband to use at work so he can always have his phone handy.  He loves that he can access his phone whenever he needs it and does not have to fumble with taking it out and putting it back anywhere.  It also makes it easier for him when listening to music to switch between songs and control the volume or whatever he may need.  It fit perfectly around his wrist and does not bother him at all nor does it get in the way while he is working.  It is made of a very nice soft material and has not caused any kind of irritation on the skin.  It is also something that can be used easily if you go to the gym or like going for walks and want to carry a key or something similar with you as it has a storage pocket for such items.  We purchased this item at a discount for our honest unbiased review.
1,Excellent product
1,Easy install. Looks amazing.
1,"My brother leant me his Anker setup when I took a trip to NYC this past June. Between consulting Google Maps and the NYC Subway Map, and just plain ole social media and web browsing, these activities placed a huge burden on my phone's battery life. I'd have to recharge it 2-3 times a day on average, 4-5 times a day during unusually heavy use. The Anker was a godsend. And their iQ USB ports charged my phone in about half the time it normally charges. The only downside was the stock USB cord that came with the battery; using the iQ port would transfer a lot of heat across the cord. Not to mention that the cord was relatively fragile. Later, when I bought my own battery, I also purchased their braided nylon cord with gold plating on the plug for a few more dollars. The battery works extremely well with the upgraded cord."
1,I love this case and best my phone stays in place when I'm driving and its soft plus it came early
-1,"I'm very disappointed in the 750 series for this product.<br /><br />My first pair I bought in April. The pair worked great, had great audio, great volume, fit nicely, and would last for hours at a time. Now, they will only stay charged for a range between six minutes to half an hours, making them unusable for my normal listening habits. Note while I typically would fully charge them over night, I tended to let them get down to 10-25% power each evening after heavy usage. Charged with a micro-usb plugged directly into a PC tower.<br /><br />My second pair I bought for my wife in July. She immediately complained about low sound quality/volume which confused me since mine had great audio. I just assumed she didn't care for the in hear headphones style but when my model started to not keep a charge, I tried her pair out. I was surprised just how quiet everything is on her pair. Audio programs I could keep at 25-50% volume on my phone and one or two clicks from the max on the old headset had to be set to max on both devices in order to be heard. Sadly by the time I noticed I was past the return window.<br /><br />I don't recommend the 750 for these issues. My previous devices kept a charge for over two years, and the volume stayed consistent. To have two devices back to back fail like this makes me concerned about trying another version of this product."
-1,"It broke after one month of use. Very generic plastic. I thought the RCA brand would have been better quality, but it turns out this branding is inked on cheap plastic.  Very disappointed."
1,Totally awesome deal!!
1,Works. I dropped it like 20 times already and it really protects your screen. I just wish I got the all black color
1,solid case to protect my phone.  home button requires a very strong push to operate.
0,the screens break to easily
1,"Very quick delivery, after initial charge it seemed to lose its battery faster than I thought while a co-worker charged her phone. Looking forward to the backup power tho!"
1,This Battery Charger brought my phone back from the dead! It was delivered in a flash. Very happy with purchase
1,OK
0,Windows phone did not fit.
1,"They are really comfortable for running and the shape does give it more strength over the ear so it does work great for sports. The only thing Im not so sure about, is the shape of the earphone it self. It feels funny and doesnt really sit tightly inside my ears as I hope it would. This makes the sound kind of strange every once in a while, but you get used to it."
1,"After  Researching for the right case I decided on this one and it was perfect.  So glad I c hose this company after reading their reviews. Definitely would buy from them again, Thanks"
1,This phone case is what's up. I've already got multiple compliments on it.
-1,Horrible the app that you are supposed to use is not on Google play store
-1,Sometimes it will re-charge but most of the time it wont. Very disappointed with this purchase.
1,its doesn't hold charge well
-1,"Doesn't charge the iphone 5 when on the Bose speaker. Sometimes works, sometimes doesnt for playing music through the speaker. Not that great."
1,Like it very much!
1,"this is my second one! I purchased this exact same cover previously, but ruined it by getting tar on it!"
1,good case protects my 4 year old nephew from breaking the tablet
1,Great product
0,"You get what you pay for. I bought this to use on an upcoming trip to Europe;I'll pick up a pay-as-you go SIM there. I'll update this revview when I get back. For now, looking at the Android part of it.<br /><br />The pros:<br />- it's cheap<br />- it works (synced up to my Google account with no problems)<br />- it's cheap<br />- wifi works fine<br />- it's cheap<br />- SIM and SD card insertion is easy and strightforward.<br /><br />The cons:<br />-miniscule memory makes it useless for all but the most basic tasks (calendar & email). I has to put in an SD card to even do the OTA update.<br />- Android KitKat really doesn't let you move system apps to the SD card.<br />- the screen sucks. Yes, it's small (I knew that ahead of time) but it's also dim and has horrible viewing angles.<br />- touch is really hit-and-miss. I have fat fingers, but even with a stylus, it's hard to hit what you're aiming at.<br /><br />Bottom line: is it worth it? Unless I run into problems with the phone part next month, the answer is &#34;yes&#34;. It's a cheap, functional &#34;throwaway&#34; Android phone that's adequate to the task, but no more."
1,Great buy
1,Really like the look. I have received many compliments
1,Got here a little later than I expected but it was worth the wait
0,Made phone bulkier than it was phone slipped out of case. Hard to use
1,"Solid construction. Had a problem sliding the case open to use the phone in hot weather - very difficult to slide.<br />As a result, I purchased another case of a different type."
1,Perfect fit for my iPhone5s
1,Very cute and decent quality.
-1,It stopped working after 2 days of use. I returned and received my money back
1,very fast phone
-1,"This product worked good for about a week, and then it stopped working, I guess you get what you pay for!!! Save your money"
1,"When i bought them i was doubting if it was going to be good. When i got them i didn't like how they look (shape). But when i put them on they were little uncomfortable but when i started listening to them they were awesome sounding. Even though you dont feel the bass you can hear it good. The noise canceling is awesome. What i also didn't like was whrn you turn the volume up or down from the headphones it has beeping sound that are way too loud.<br />Good: good bass, noice cancelation<br />Bad: can't feel the bass, the volume beeps are too loud, shape, and sometimes uncomfortable."
1,Works as described.
0,Small but okay.some memory should come with it.the picture quality is not that good.fast shipping
1,"Received very quickly, love suppliers who can deliver!  Does what it says, but knocked down a bit because of the disappointment finding out the phone needs to be placed on it pretty precisely in order for it to start charging (using Nexus 6).  Thought it would be a lot more convenient to simply place the phone right on top of it and that would be it but seems like there is a fair amount of slightly moving the phone around each time to find the &#34;sweet spot&#34; in order for it to start charging.  Tried without cases on, with, didn't matter.  -Edit to note that after using for a little while muscle memory begins to kick in and seems a lot easier now to place the phone on there lined up correctly so a bit of a learning curve in the beginning is all.  Charges fairly fast but compared to the Quick Charge cord provided by Motorola with the Nexus 6 it can't compare but not a huge deal for me, just an FYI for others."
1,The case was delivered on time and the quality was as promised.
1,sound is very good. this is a great deal for the price.
1,I put it on and haven't regretted it.  It does make the watch larger and beefier looking.  The only thing I didn't like was that the screen protector leaves a small gap of 2-3mm between the screen protector and the outer ring of protection.  No problems installing it
1,"Can't beat these for the price. I've had them all. Sounds great off of the my pioneer 6700. I'm sure they would sound even better with an amp. If you were to spend money on an amp, do it right. Don't skimp if you want quality audio."
1,nice
1,One of the best phone cases I've ever had it is sturdy and holds up pretty good when dropped.
1,😀👍
1,"One of the best Alpine I have ever owned.  My only concern is the sound adjustment needs a little more tweeking.  On my old Alpine, I could pick the frequency, and the MX was easier to turn on and off.  Other than that, this stereo is great.  It went in easy, and with all the necessary hardware. I love the Blu tooth capability, and especially the ability to play music without having a jack to connect to, even though it comes with both a jack and a USB port.  I would buy this all over again if I had to..."
1,"This the second one I bought.  Great price for a great product, if only I would stop losing them!"
-1,It stop's working less than a week
1,"I love this phone, It can work as a tracfone or be tied to verizon which I plan on doing soon.<br />perfect if you want the perks of a smart phone and the affordability. I have an iphone 6 I use as an ipod now, those things are way too expensive for plans."
1,For what your paying its worth it but the cross does start de-coloring about after a week. other than that it is really pretty!
0,Does this case fit a note 3 phone?
-1,Did not charge
1,Had been looking for some sort of holster to cut down on &#34;pocket calls&#34;! This clips on ok but is a little bulky due to the size of the Note 2. But no more unplanned calls going out!
1,Love this case. It's solid and the back is sticky enough to use the case as advertised without also acting as a dir magnet. Some nits kf ljnt etc stick but nothing major. The back and sides offer a nice rubbery feeling in hand as well.
1,"If you don't have Bluetooth or an aux jack in your car, this is perfect. Signal is clear, despite going over radio."
-1,ITS THE WRONG SIZE. IT DOES NOT FIT Huawei Ascend II
1,"Almost perfect except it arrived cracked.  Because it is clear, it isn't too noticeable, but it was kinda disappointing."
1,This is very easy to use although sometimes it starts taking rapid photos for some reason. I'm glad I can finally take decent family pictures.
1,"Perfect fit, perfect suction"
1,Works as advertised. This transmitter allows me to share my playlists with a work out buddy.
1,"I have used this for a week. Comfortable, warm and has good quality sound. Slept through a neighbor's party."
1,"I really enjoy these headphones; however, they do not stay charged long enough."
1,"Enjoy using it, only think it doesn't seem to work on iPad with FaceTime. Works with movies and use<br />It outside to listen to radio station."
1,It was Grate!!!!
-1,"should have read it other reviews before buying. It keeps falling off and finally I lost one. Now I cannot return it as well.<br />Other than that, it was OK. It is not hard plastic, it is soft rubber band and somewhat protects the watch from minor bumps. I had black one and it wasn't looking bad on watch although it hides the shining side surface of the watch."
-1,"They're okay cords.  Really great price and nice colors, but much of the time they don't work when charging my iPhone or iPad."
-1,They are very cheap and the rubber comes off very easily they barely work
1,Awesome
1,"I got this case in Turquoise Mint and I love it! I have had quite a few Caseology cases and they never seem to let me down.<br /><br />This case fits nice and snug and while it feels sturdy and protected, it doesn't add a lot of weight or bulk to the phone. The material is like a thick TPU and it is VERY smooth to touch. The color is vibrant and beautiful.<br /><br />I took one star off because the case needs to be slightly altered for the Verizon version of the Note 4. This is actually a common problem with the Verizon phones, the mic hole to the left of the charger port is about 1/4 inch farther away than it is on the other carrier models. This is due to the different chipset that Verizon uses over AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc. But it is an easy enough fix so you can get around it.<br /><br />All in all, I'd highly recommend this case.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. However your own opinion might vary. I received no monitory compensation and not required to give a good review. This disclosure is in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions Guidelines on Testimony and Advertising."
1,Just beautiful and I love it.
1,"Very handy piece of equipment for those of us that are in our cars a lot.  It's a bit top heavy so the connection does come and go a little bit.  None the less, glad I bought it."
1,Wonderful! Great to have an easy to use product with a free online help to install video too. Nice price and super fast shipping.
-1,I had this professionally installed. As soon I played the first song it sounded like the voice coil was blown. I've messed around with the different levels so much and it still sounds like complete sh*t. Such a waste of money. Hundreds of dollars spent on this just to be used for a month then disconnected and put away in a closet.
1,perfect stand
1,"This case is sturdy, easy to use, and provides good protection for the Samsung S6. It is at least equal to cases selling for over $40 in the phone stores."
0,I assumed that the plug was a T-shape so you could plug in a microphone. The hole is plugged. I'm disappointed.
1,This is our 2nd purchase of this charger.  My husband wanted one for his car too!  It does have a tightly coiled cord so you can't really talk easily while driving but we use blu tooth anyway.  We always double check that it is pushed all the way in every time we hook our phone up to the charger to make sure it is plugged in.  It does have a red indicator light to let you know that it is all set.
1,"Great phone case, it fits nice and snug, true to its words, waterproof shock proof. My only problem is that it seems to be not tough enough for a Marine. I dropped it so many times the from cover is falling off the stand broke off and a corner of the case broke off, still sick and water proof but unsure if I want to test it, I bought another one because I am sure the next one is to last longer. Great case for a great price, just not intense work environment"
1,"Works great with my 5s. Make sure to REMOVE PHONE if you turn on the heater!. Makes it somewhat less than ideal in the winter, however it's easy to remove if needed."
1,Great case especially for a teen who drops phone a lot. This is  new one for iPhone 6. Looks great and price / shipping were excellent
-1,the battery lasts 4 hours
-1,"Worked fine, but it needs a stronger strain relief.  The sheating on mine at the Lightning connector broke away from the connector leaving the wires exposed.  Soon after the wires frayed and I had to dispose of the cable.  Maybe this was a fluke, but for $15 I expected better."
1,Good color and very useful for college students.  However the wristband is pretty cheap quality and feels like it will rip any moment.
1,Love it....it's small & very sturdy and holds my cell phone perfectly
1,Nice. My granddaughter like it. I received it sooner than expected. Thank you so much.
1,Well this is the third intelliglass product that I have used.  Two for the galaxy note 4 and one for the wife's galaxy s5  all went on with out problems except for the first one on the note.  But it was my fault.  Looks clean and smooth.  S-pen glides over the screen.
1,Great product! Love it!! Works real good and nice fit for my cell..
1,Great product.
0,Good!
1,Really nice quality for the price
1,excelent
-1,Cheap Apple knockoffs with horrible sound.
-1,"Wrong screwdrivers, we need a T1. No point in ordering this package."
1,At first I was skeptical but this product was Perfect! My phone never got wet.
1,Was delivered on time works well and I would recommend.
1,Nice case very slim I had an expensive Life Proof case before; I prefer this one
1,Came on time it's good quality and the extra port is useful
1,"I like the concept, to have a full cover and a small space for your money and a few cards.  This only took a few days to arrive.  I was a little bit disappointed in the quality, it;s good, but not great...but for the price, it's not a bad deal."
1,A+++
0,Its an okay product. I installed in my work helmet and it does not get as loud as i thought i was going to get. But still an okay product. Price does not match the quality. They need to lower the price a bit more
1,"I really like this design. The designer of this design I believe is Nicklas Gustafsson called \\""Wooden Navy.\\""  The design is also sold from Society 6, however their case doesn't fully protect the phone, here is the link [...]  I bought both of these products. I dropped my phone with the Society 6 case and it got a little dinged.  This case is light weight, feels good and protects the phone.    I paid $35 for the Society 6 one, this product I paid $0.89 for and a few dollars shipping. It said it would come in 2 months but actually took a few weeks.  All the buttons are very easily accessible. This case is actually designed very well above other cases. The original case designed by Society 6 does not protect the entire phone, this one does. Maybe the two makers of these cases can get together and design the ultimate product!"
0,"Just got it. Disappointed! It's just glitter glued to plastic, rough and prickly edged. Also not a good fit."
0,It's not original Samsung  product but it's okay.
1,"These are great headphones for sub $30. I've had these now for over 2 months and can tell you they provide sound quality to that of headphones that are over $100. The fit is excellent. I've not had great fit experience in the past with other products that go in my ear. They are very comfortable to wear. Overall I'm very happy with this product. Highly recommend if you're looking for a great sounding, comfortable pair of in-ear headphones.<br /><br />I purchased this product from Amazon and have not received any compensation, free product or other benefit from the manufacturer or Amazon for my review. The product tested was NOT a free sample from the manufacturer and the opinions stated above are solely mine based on my interaction with the product."
1,Quality is excellent<br />very worth the price
1,Good case
1,Love it
1,GR8 WOULD RECOMMEND
-1,"Like other reviewers have said, the protector does not fully stick to the phone and leaves a ring around the edges. It makes the phone look cheap. The top right of the protector has also been coming off since I put it on and leaves a large bubble."
1,Hopefully I won't have to find out if it works!
1,Loud enough to listen to in a decent size room. Has a good amount of bass for such a small speaker. Would definitely buy again
1,This are nice headphones but my lgs have a better quality sound. .
1,Love it
-1,It burnt out after about 6 hours of use.
1,Totally perfect! Now I can charge 2 devices at once. Always useful especially on long trips
1,Exactly what I needed to replace the old one I had.
1,Awesome case low profile not bulky I ordered it in red and love it. I will be ordering it again in other colors! Great buy!!!
1,"This armband is perfect.  I can fit my iPhone 6 in there without having to remove it from the case (unlike other armbands I've tried).  The material is flexible enough to be able to use the buttons from outside, and the clear front still allows me to use the touch screen.  The band is not constrictive when I workout, yet it holds the phone in place perfectly.  I wash it by hand in cool water.  I use the belt to hold my key fob and my sunglasses at the gym."
-1,"High end is tinny and distorted, likely a side effect of Bluetooth audio compression.<br />When running better quality audio through the AUX input, the sound quality improves dramatically.<br />However, the speaker just does NOT get loud enough.<br />The rubber texture picks up and holds on to dust and dirt.<br /><br />Got mine on sale at a box store for $40, and returned it the next day. Certainly would NOT pay $100 for it."
1,Great little case
1,Ordered just before trip. Easy to install. Works great if you find the correct placement of the antenna
1,It is good product and good services. I like this Zagg always!
-1,hate it hate it hate it.  You get what you pay for.  Terrible connections.
1,Fits perfect! Great protection for a great price!
1,I've tried many cases. This is by far the most durable and best case.
1,"This is by far the single best protector on the market. Functions perfectly , enhances the device, and really really works!"
1,It's just a basic plastic phone back cover nothing major but if that's all you need it for like me it's protect the Phone.
1,works perfect. does the truck for me!
1,Works great. Would give 5 star for customer service!
1,"Came way before the expected delivery date, it's amazing quality, and very cute!!"
-1,It says it charges windows 1020 it don't says it charges iPhone 4s it don't says it charges samsung s5 it don't ...so I tried a older phone I had I don't use cause the screen is cracked it's a Nokia 900 hey that worked completely useless to me it charges none of the 4 phones in the house ...
1,"What can I say, I wanted to connect my old monitor, and this item works for that purpose. Seems well made."
1,Easiest repair I ever did. No instructions needed.
1,excellent!!!
1,"I have had it for a while now and couldn't love it more it hits great, gets deep, and has great build quality i don't care if it's built in China or not it is build better than my American made car"
1,"I have never used a monopod or &#34;selfie stick&#34; before so I wasn't entirely certain what to expect. I am a historic preservationist by profession and frequently in old buildings you need details you can't easily access or photos of crawlspaces that are too narrow to navigate so I thought that this might help take photos in such circumstances. Although I've been in the market for one for a while, I had not settled on one until I saw this one which seemed complete yet simple enough to use for a first-timer.<br /><br />Since I received it, I have done nothing but play with it! It fits my digital cameras, my phones, and the clasp piece which holds all of them can be adjusted so that it can turn into a mount for my regular camera. Even better, the clasp comes off to reveal a screw that can accommodate a camera directly! It's got a long reach. It's sturdy. The rubber handle is ridged for a good grip. It also has a strap at the end so it can be kept on a wrist for ease of use. I am so much happier with it than I had anticipated. Perhaps the best feature though is that you can snap pictures from the button on the handle! That's incredible!<br /><br />I received this for free in exchange for a genuine critique"
1,Great Phone definitely worth the price and a nice screen size
-1,"The other reviews are SHILLS. Check the favorable reviews: They were compensated for a good review. This item would not hold my phone for any longer than 60 seconds, and then it would fall off. I can just imagine how many people bought this expecting it to hold their phones up only to have them fall down, fall out of the car, and hit the concrete and shatter.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK."
1,Great
1,Very happy with product
1,Fit just right and protects my screen great. Easy to install.
1,The RavPower USB charger is very good & works as advertised and I am very satisfied with it.<br />Venkatesh
-1,Not pleased with this purchase. Comes with two protectors and first one the punch outs weren't aligned properly and would needed to be put on phone crooked. Second one lined up good. Bubbles were minimal and easy to remove. My problem was that it left a blurry look to the screen. Expected from a film protector I suppose. Rubbed nail on protector lightly to remove last bubble after other methods didn't work and it ripped right through. Customer service was good though for replacement.
1,I got this charge for my desk and it works just like the one that came in the box with my phone. Plus it came with an extra cord.
-1,"Be careful when ordering, there is no way this cover fits the s6 edge, it about 3/4 the size and will not stretch"
-1,"this product does not work, it is awful!!!  ... water damage to iPhone 5S ...  life proof does not stand behind its product ..."
0,sort of works
1,Thank you
1,Great little case.
-1,broken in two months
1,It definitely protects the phone. I've dropped it a few times and it's still safe. It does block the front camera a little though.
1,"Came very fast I love. It got dirty quick, any ideas on how to clean?!"
0,Does this case have screen protection?like a plastic membrane or just the raised lip protection?
1,I'm very unhappy with this item.  It has very low memory and the internal storage filled very vast
1,Well made sturdy protective and attractive case.  Its a great buy!
1,"I was sent a review copy of this product free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I have thoroughly tested the product to the best of my ability before posting this review.<br /><br />The I6 Cable(TM) lightning cable is a very good alternative to the genuine Apple lightning cable, and it's value for money makes it far superior than most alternatives on Amazon.<br /><br />From Apple, the lightning cable costs $19 and will probably last you around six months before the plastic wrap begins to peel. A very common issue amongst Apple users - just check any social network!<br /><br />The extra length means you can actually use the phone while it is charging.<br /><br />This lightning cable is wrapped in a slightly thicker and more durable plastic which will hopefully last longer and prevent it from tearing and ripping around the lightning connector area.<br /><br />you won't get an error message saying 'This accessory is not compatible with iPhone' when you plug it in. This is usually the case for a lot of cheaper.<br /><br />I can also confirm this works flawlessly with my iPad Air, iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. It's also good to see that I6 Cable(TM) have confidence that their product will last longer than the Apple equivalent, which is why it comes with an 12-month warranty! I'll surely be updating this review in 12 months time.<br /><br />An improvement that could be made to the I6 Cable(TM) lightning cable is that it could be wrapped in Nylon rather than plastic. There are other products out there that use a Nylon cable over a plastic one simply because it is so much more durable and can withstand a lot of abuse. I currently use a Nylon-wrapped lightning cable and it has lasted me over 8 months already without a single sign of wear. It will be interesting to see how this one holds out comparatively."
1,Perfect battery and a great price.  Works perfectly in my phone and has restored my battery life back to original like new condition.
1,This is an awesome case. Everything that is said on their website is true about it I especially love the feel and how slim it is.  Great Product looking forward to my next purchase and color.  They should offer a red case as well just a thought.
-1,"Screen still shattered with this case on, save your money"
1,Case held up great durring the time i had the phone!
-1,not good broken item.
1,Great!
1,I received my order in just a few days. I'm so happy now I don't have to charge my phone everytime I turn around.
1,Recvd on time . Reception good most of the time. Audio on other end said to be faint.
1,Excellent application.
-1,Returned. Slow to charge and was smaller than I thought it would be.
0,It's beautiful and I do feel like it will protect my phone well if I drop it.  Unfortunately not all of my chargers fit through the opening in the case so I have to take the case off to charge the phone depending on which charger I have with me.  I am hoping that it doesn't leak on my phone like others have reported.  Now I'm thinking about replacing it even though I haven't had a problem with it yet.
-1,Screen went blank after a couple of months.
1,I like the slim look and feel. Feels durable and fits the phone perfectly. I would order from them again.
-1,"I give it 1 star for idea, but it is faulty"
1,I've had this case on my phone for over two years and it has worked splendidly. It has yet to let my phone suffer any damage and I drop it all the time. Such a great case for the price.
1,"So far so good... bought 2 just because I got a promocode and got it really cheap. Although it was only $10 with the discount, it was easily worth $20 and for sure. So far after several months, its good for what it does. No complaints."
-1,"No access to Mute key. Completely covers ear speaker and lower speakers causing low volume and muffled sound. Description says &#34;access to all buttons&#34; then later says &#34;except mute key&#34; it's quite deceiving. I've only had this for one day, it fell from the floor board of my LOW car to the pavement, and the lanyard holder broke in half. I really don't know how this has had a 5 star rating up until now. It is very low quality, especially for the price."
1,"This is a very compact selfie stick and feels good in your hand.  The quality seems good for the price and I think it should hold up nicely.  I wanted a hard wire shutter version because I don't want to worry about if it's charged when I want to use it.  However, only time will tell if the wire connection at the head will hold up over time.  Yes, I would recommend this product to a friend."
0,ok
1,works great
1,I absolutely love this case. The quality is amazing.
1,Love the quality.
1,Many uses! Like it a lot.
1,These are great little speakers. Bluetooth connectivity is easy on both my phone and laptop. The sound is amazing for the size of the speaker with good bass response.<br /><br />Phone calls can be routed through with ease and the built in microphone is adequate. Very portable and with a decent battery life and good recharge time. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this and several of my friends have bought one after hearing mine. At this price you can't afford not to.
-1,"One of the handsets stopped working after using it 3 times. And I can't return it, not happy would not purchase again."
1,"I purchased this because it was partially transparent and it shows off the vibrant blue color of my ipod touch 5. It is VERY easy to put on my ipod, and fits like a glove. The silicone material provides a nice grip and it does not slide off. It is simple, yet still protects the ipod well. I would definitely buy again!"
1,This case fit my Moto E LTE perfectly.  Absolutely love the look and feel of it.
1,This mounting system is fast and lightweight. I was nervous our how reliable this product would be. After watching a few youtube videos of actual testing I felt comfortable buying it. Glad I bought it. I used it for an ipod touch and it is supported very well. It just made it across Wisconsin without giving me an issue.
1,The Edge 200 works well.  I have had issues a few times getting it to find a GPS signal.  In those cases I have to power it off and on to get it working.  Other than that issue it has worked very well.  The only downside is that it tells me how far off I was on my mileage estimation before.  :(
-1,It's absurd that Amazon is selling this item.  It speaks in Chinese and there's no information on how to change the language.
-1,It didn't work and I was disappointed.
1,"Love this, brought it on vacation and was able to charge multiple phones easily. Not too heavy, would definitely recommend!"
1,Just got it. Love it
-1,Didn't like it
1,NICE
1,Used it very much.
0,"The Seedan Lovely Cat Gel Back Case for Samsung is adorable and of a high quality material. It is, however, a thinner gel case and will not provide the highest level of cushion should the phone be dropped.  One issue I saw was that the openings cut for the charger, volume, etc. are just ever so slightly off.. In my opinion, the case is great for occasional use but, due to the inconsistencies in the placement of the openings, may not be be best for everyone."
1,"Nice case, fits well."
1,These are great. I'm a field service tech and drive everywhere for work. I love the face you can place these anywhere on your dash or windshield.  This fits my iPhone6 (not iPhone6 plus) great while using phone for gps. It works so well that I purchased one for my wife and her Samsung S5 fits it as well and she really likes the iOttie.
1,Small and light. Barely notice that I've added a cover to my G3.
1,"i have bought several sets of headphones in the $12-$70<br />these are by far the best sounding and absolutely the best value of all that i have tried.<br />they have the best bass response of all of them, and even sound better than many of my corded units."
-1,"While they worked well for a couple months, the metal posts the speakers sit on have both snapped.  I don't see a way to fix it easily as the metal post inside the speaker needs to be replaced.  These might be good clamped to a pipe in your room, but don't use them on anything that moves because the vibrations will break them."
1,"I'm changing my review because though the color is somewhat off, this is a very protective case. A SUV ran my phone over while it was in this case and my phone survived and the case was only slightly scratched"
1,I would have liked it to give the phone numbers calling the phone
0,Gasket failed had defect in rubber
1,Have received nothing but compliments on the color.  It has protected my phone several times when it was dropped.
1,"Just got my new case and so far so good. Looks just like it does in the picture. Only thing I don't like about it is that when you open the case all the way the magnetic part won't hold the case when it's open, but I knew that would be an issue when I purchased it. Very nice quality and very fast shipment :)"
1,"Amazing, started a diesel lawnmower with a dead battery that would not charge"
-1,"IF YOU HAVE 2012 AND NEWER MACS- DO NOT BUY. THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE. AFTER RESEARCHING AND CALLING APPLE SUPPORT- I FOUND OUT THIS DOESNT WORK ON NEW MACS BECUASE THEY DO NOT COME W/ INFARED .....<br /><br />YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ANY APP AND USE IT TO PLAY MUSIC, NETFLIX, HULU, ETC. I DOWNLOADED HIPPO LITE AND IT WORKS JUST FINE.<br /><br />HAD TO RETURN AND GOT A REFUND"
1,Good!
1,"A tad bulky (compared to other chargers) but carries much more power and works just as claimed.  NOTE: charged phones, Nooks, and lots of other devices just fine.  Would NOT charge an Asus tablet, but the Asus tablet is a pig."
1,Works beautifully to go from iPad to TV
0,"I like the slim design and able to get almost three full charges for my S6, as long as I don't use it at the same time.  When I charge the device it doesn't indicate it has a full charge light...always one light bar...so I never know how much I have left.  Otherwise, it's a good product."
1,Great product. Works well. Good price.
1,"Absolutely loved it!  Did not give it a five stars because the JETech logo on the back is TOO LARGE.  The reason why people buy clear or transparent covers is so you can see the natural beauty of the phone.  Nowadays phones have gorgeous designs you don't want to spoil with an ugly cell phone cover, but you still need to protect your phone from scratches.  I would definitely recommend this product and would encourage to make their logo invisible."
1,It does what I need it to do.
1,Very fast shipping and it was packaged well so the film was not bent. Can't wait to put it on my phone!
1,Nice product at a nice price.
1,"It is great not to have to charge my phone every day, or have a low battery half way through the day of heavy use. Fits perfectly on my Samsung S4."
1,Incredible!  This is one of the best stylus's I've used.  My ipad responds very fast.
1,Best glass screen I ever bought.
-1,Worst case ever! Not only did it not fit or connect you also couldn't charge the phone with the case on.  Basically I just caught 17 bucks on fire for no reason... disappointed!
-1,broke within two days of having.
1,"Very good product, recommended 100%"
1,This is a good tracker for the money!
1,"Light weight, quality, and durable. A great value!"
1,"Damn, why Cant they just be a little cheaper. I am very picky with my money, but I used these with the Comply Foam Ear Tips and I was blown away how great they sound. I don't even play with the ear hooks/wings/ whatever everyone wants to call them. I don't have too. with the Comply Foam tips, you get an incredible seal that blocks out the World around you and When using the right size, you can workout and run and jump and head bang knowing your headphones will not be falling out. I love the hardshell case in comparison to the cheap bags that everyone else provides, the bags protect from scratches and nothing more, the case that come with these, will protect your investment. They are as portable as you can get without purchasing the EARIN. Bottom line, all customers would appreciate a lower price on any and every item, but these are honestly worth the money as long as they are durable enough. only time will tell that tale."
1,fast shipping works great
1,Great item my customers love the results from repairs using your product thanks
1,Works great and isn't intrusive at all. I love it.
0,"Love the size, but the plug for the iPhones is super tight..."
-1,"The product and shipping ammenities were fine.  When I applied the screen, it took quite a while for the air bubbles to disappear (the instructions said a few days; it took a few weeks).  The screen also seems to smudge very easily via fingerprints and stylus use. I have to wipe off the screen with a microfibre cloth once every few hours, or it will start to build up and look rather nasty.  Edit: I was sent another one, and this time the air bubbles disappeared quicker than last time.  Still, it smudges really badly and has fingerprints everywhere. One of the pictures shows that it doesn't have any, but that's obviously not the case."
1,"Works better then I even hoped for.  Dealer wanted $450.00 to replace the the Bluetooth module on my 2006 Acura TL.  This cost me $50.00 and works perfectly, It's voice control and crystal clear.  The only negative but it is not the Jabra fault, before engaging the Jabra you will have to turn down your music yourself.  But saving $400.00 is well worth that one little drawback."
0,The case looks and feels fantastic. Unfortunately it is extremely weak. the small tab surrounding the power button broke taking the case off. I was extremely careful when trying to remove the case because the tab was so small but it still snapped easier than a toothpick.
1,This is a great case. It fits the phone well and the magnet keeps the cover in place with no difficulty. It gives reasonable protection against a fall and keeps both sides of the phone safe from scratches. Looks nice too.
1,It works. Had one for 10 years and gave it to my niece. Couldn't go without it...
1,By far the best screen protector I've ever used. Very easy to install. No bubbles. All 4 corners are secure. No issues whatsoever.
-1,Didnt work. Charger didnt fit in hole. Sent back for replacement. We will see.
1,"I had been looking for a cheap phone to replace my Galaxy note in my work environment because I don't want to break it.<br /><br />I've tried 5 different phones: 2 Cubot, 1 Blu , 1 Irullu and the RCA M1. Well I can tell you that the previous ones had issues but the RCA works best.<br />Since starting using it my Note stayed in the drawer. The RCA does everything I want it to do and does it quite well... It has only 1 issue which I can live with. The WIFI sometimes looses signal and I have to fight to get it back (Part of this may be due to my router here).<br /><br />The camera is worthless at night or in low light but works OK in daylight. The video format is .3pg which many people can't view when sending a video via email. (workaround is to use a video converter before sending) .<br /><br />I would recommend this phone to anyone who want a disposable phone that works.<br />3G works fine on 850mhz but the phone does not support 3G on 900mhz. I use 2 different companies and one is on 850 the other on 900. Does not bother me because the 3G prices are the same for the both companies so I just use the 850 one.<br /><br />Actually I've bought 2 of them and would buy an other right away if I break one to always have a spare.<br /><br />I've used some heavy apps some are a bit slow but still do the job. Skype works but on the slow side."
1,"Looks a little different when your phone isn't white, but still cute!"
1,"Legit company, legit battery"
1,"This product works amazingly. I didn't want to spend they money to get the stereo replaced on my older model car, I take a lot of road trips, and i'm cheap, so this product is a dream. The sound was awesome, and it was super simple to use. Would highly recommend."
1,"I have had fm transmitters before, and I was aware going into this purchase that reception can be sketchy, and you usually have to have the thing sitting just right.  When I got this unit I was very pleased with it's ease of use, variety of features, and for being an fm transmitter the reception I was getting from it wasn't too bad. It was definitely tolerable. This was my cheap solution for modernizing my truck without tearing into the dash to install a custom unit. Can't beat it for the price.  Oh, but fyi... It's pretty bad when being used for speakerphone. I tried it once, and the other person couldn't even hear me. I use a different unit for phone calls. This unit works well doing just about everything else it advertised."
-1,10000maH does not seem to be right. I could only charge a samsung s3 and iphone 6 at one go. And had to charge all over again. Barely two weeks into my purchase and it hardly has any charge capacity
1,"So far so good. It really is easy to get on if you have a steady hand. Mine is slightly more to one side but since nothing was affected by this I didn't try to take off n reapply. When you  lay it on the screen it immediately adheres. Absolutely no bubbles. That's how easy it is. Place it on and bam you're done. It doesn't wrap down the sides, it sits on top with a very very tiny space on either side. This allows you to use a case. I've got the incipeo ngp and the two together fit great. It feels great and the touch is perfect. It looks and feels like glass so the touch is smooth and the visual is totally clear with no distortion. I haven't dropped my phone so I don't know if it will protect the screen or not. I'm hopeful that if I do drop it, the Sir Lancelot will save the day."
1,"When I first preferred them I was a little worried, but once we got to the camp site they worked exceptionally well. I was actually surprised by the range on them, and the sound is phenomenal !"
-1,Once u take the film off so u can attach one side to the phone the protector bends and does not want to fit to the phone. Lifts on all sides. Not a good quality...
-1,Didn't work for me! Received only one piece... not the three pieces shown in the picture.
1,The best product on Amazon.  We took this for our phones on our cruise.  We took snorkeling photos with our phone and not a drop inside the bag.  I tell everyone about this.
-1,Can't really find a place on the steering wheel where you can secure it and have range of motion of the wheel
-1,It broke when I got it
1,"Charges my android galaxy note 3 super fast. Fastest i've seen for any charger. Great feel, nice smooth color. very happy."
1,"A very convenient item. The con is that it does not come with a USB-to-MicroUSB adapters, so I had to spend additional money in order to purchase that."
1,great look and fits well.
1,"Power wise, its great. Construction is lacking in some ways. After months of rigorous use swapping between 2 of these and an OEM original, the bottom black plastic edge cracked off 3/4 of the way. It still works but be careful or you may have problems with the contacts not touching because of a now slightly shorter battery"
-1,Strap broke and starting coming apart. Didn't even use it that long either.
1,Now it solved my problem of selfie or asking strangers to use my phone which was un-safe from get go.<br /><br />Easy to setup and now I go everywhere with this selfie stick.<br /><br />I plan to buy for gifting to some close friends.
1,This is great when im working out. Finally found one for the 6 plus!!!
-1,"When charging 2 devices the 2nd device blinks on and off as though you were unplugging and plugging in the charger, it does this on all devices that I have tried to charge.  Very disappointed."
1,"I've wanted one of these for years.<br /><br />I bought one as a Christmas present for myself since I didn't really get anything.<br />When my family saw it, they laughed, but then they started using it and really liked it as well.<br /><br />This is especially useful for me since there are cracks on my phone near the speakers and it cuts into my ear when I talk on the phone. The handset is much easier to hold and more comfortable as well. It's also more clear since I can't hear as much outside noises on my end."
1,worked well
1,best back up battery I have owned!! this will charge my Iphone several times before I have to charge it. Love that it also charges my Ipad. Highly recommend.
-1,"bad screen,,faded colors ,,unresponsive to touch after cpl weeks ,,started getting spots in it ,"
1,"Good cables are so hard to find (and afford) - and Anker has once again come through with a winner.<br /><br />This cable is of the same high quality, durability, and dependability of all other Anker cables. I have never had it fail to charge OR sync, and the connections are reinforced to the extent that I can see no decay in integrity in those spots close to the connectors that typically fray.<br /><br />Bravo, Anker - thank you for delivering yet again.<br /><br />(In the spirit of full disclosure, I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, yet I promise that my review is fair and honest.)"
1,AWESOME fits BLU LIFE VIEW phone 5.2inch screen
1,"Bought an iPad and saved $100 by getting the WiFi only model.  Only to realize there is no GPS on these.  So, bought this for GPS routing.  Works great and works great in an airplane as well.  Sit it near the window and your tracking your plane.  Standalone, you can use it to plot a route on a Polaris or other ATV.  I download the route and then overlay it on to a map."
-1,"I purchased this sub and box new off ebay mainly for the low profile. Fit perfectly behind the rear seats of my tundra crew max. Hooked it up to my Alpine 230w amp that was originally powering the component speakers.  The sub was blown after 3 weeks of use. Disappointed since I  never experienced the full potential of the sub. I always allow at least 1 month of break in before running the rated RMS wattage, or turning off the LPF. Replacing with pioneer shallow mount, same enclosure with slight reinforcements made. Much better"
1,"I bought this to take on a recent trip to Costa Rica. It protected my iPhone 6 just fine, but was a little snug with the case on. I recommend taking the case off of your phone before using this waterproof case. Very durable, seals out any sand and water that could damage the phone. The plastic is very high-quality and didn't interfere with the quality of pictures, which was my main concern. I would recommend this product to a friend."
-1,"says it has magnetic closure, it does not !  and Gmyle says it does not come with magnetic closure,so if you want the cover to stay closed don't buy this one."
-1,This is not at all a case worth for iPhone. The first day itself the plastic coating started peeling off. I had a spigen case but it's kickstand was broken so I was looking for a new one but this has been a disappointment.
0,Charger does not work cords are good though and still worth the price
1,"Wonderful quality, much better than I expected for the price.  Very pleased with my case!!!"
1,excelent
-1,"Adorable design, but hilariously poor quality. You get what you pay for."
1,Perfect and good
1,"[[VIDEOID:409e7fcf7d98fb627689fd15405aaa77]] I like using my phone and sometimes tablet to follow recipes in the kitchen. The thing is I can make a mess and the phone always seems like it is in the way, or I cant see it well. That's where this guy comes in. This is a basic & small but hefty universal stand. I like that it can be used with a number of devices and adjusted to various angles. It has rubber pads under the stand to protect the surface it rests on and provide a bit of grip. The rubber pads are also in the cradle portion where your device rests and on the back to provide a bit of grip and cushion. Full disclosure this was provided to me by the seller to review. If you have any questions please leave a comment and I am happy to respond.<br /><br />Update 11/16: This little stand is still going strong and is used almost every day in my kitchen:)<br /><br />Amazon Disclosure Statement:<br />-I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review; or<br />-I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.<br />Why the statement? Amazon says I have to. Why did I get the product at a discount? I guess I’m lucky. Either way I hope the review was helpful. I try to do my best to update reviews but if you have any questions about my long term experience with a product please leave a comment and I will gladly respond."
1,"I was happy to see this product available for review opportunity to give my unbiased opinion.<br /><br />I've seen these selfie sticks all over the place and the use has intrigued me.  This particular Maxpro stick is great.  It is so easy to use.  I thought I would have to have even the teeniest bit of tecno savvy, but no.  The handle is very good, no slip, hard rubber.  It has a telescope that allows you to extend the camera about three feet.  There is also a rubber holder that takes my iphone perfectly, but I think it holds any smart phone.  We've had a great time using it at a recent family gathering that we could easily shoot group shots and immediately post them; it looked like we had someone else taking the picture.  It was a kick for those who couldn't make it.  You can't tell that you were the one that just took that picture.  You can get creative with angles and get very interesting shots.  Of course, there is a button on the handle that allows you to take the shot.  I'm going to be using this at my office to make business quick videos.  It is great.  I couldn't be happier.  You can actually see a picture of yourself from a distance, just setup your camera to show reverse, in case you ever get lonely for yourself.  You probably want to charge it up before using for about 3 hours; I did."
-1,"Lasted for less than 2 months after purchase, Defective product. No longer charges devices. Seems like the cables inside became loose and have a false connection."
0,"While I can use this as a phone battery in the car, it does NOT have a cord that connects directly to the iPhone. I had thought it would.  It will be useful, but now I've got to go buy something to connect it to my phone.  Should be a one purchase deal as far as I'm concerned."
1,Unsure why I didn't buy one of these sooner. It's very convenient since it allows me to charge all of my devices at once. Looking forward to bringing this on my upcoming travels!
1,nice
1,I have really enjoyed this case. Fix perfect on my phone. Great for the price.
1,"amazing prices and products. I needed this, and I couldn't get a better price with their promo code in exchange to leave a  review!"
1,So far I love these headphones. They stay put whether I'm running long distances or working out at the gym. It's easy to use and functions well.
1,Awesome Product! I never write reviews but I love this screen protector. It was super easy to place on my iPhone! It's the first time I didn't get dust or bubbles under my screen! Highly recommend this product.
1,I swear by this brand and case. Even got my sister hooked. Have purposely thrown my phone across the room and it's still in new condition.
1,"Excellent product ,  I am very satisfied with its performance.  It's the second one I have purchased.  With one exception:  they do not furnish a printed user's manual, only a PDF file you can download and print yourself ( it's 120 pages long! )"
-1,Products don't work. Spend a few more dollars and get a better product. Very disappointed and will NEVER order from these suppliers again.
1,Great product and works great. Having it 10 ft long is nice and can reach anywhere.
-1,"Not what it was billed as, as only one port will charge at a time"
1,"This thing worked great for my purposes; In a fairly quiet room, vocal only, undetectable (he was looking), batteries lasted for more than 90 minutes. Make sure it is directly touching your ear drum and you will feel like you are wearing headphones"
1,"Bought this for my recent trip to Asia and it did not disappoint.  I was able to recharge my phone battery twice a day which was critical for me using GPS to navigate.  Very reliable, I was very pleased."
0,"I can't comment on the other accessories, but I can say that the 2TB USB flash drive offered here is a fake-capacity drive.<br /><br />Plastic sticks, metal swivels, silver bullets, gold bars, iron man, and a whole range of generic and novelty styles drives advertising huge memory capacities at wildly low prices. What do they have in common? If you look inside, they have the same internals and they all have fake capacity.<br /><br />You risk losing some or all of your valuable data if you buy this drive. Read on...<br /><br />Beware fake capacity flash drives - especially unusually low-priced generic (and brand-name look-alike) drives 64GB and up.<br /><br />This and many other cheap apparently high capacity flash drives are really low capacity 4GB or 8GB drives that have been hacked (controller chip settings altered) by dishonest Chinese suppliers so that they show a false inflated capacity. That is why their price is so low. Such drives are then redistributed by a few clueless resellers and by many other fully-aware resellers who are out to make a quick profit.<br /><br />These drives will show their false capacity in Windows properties, but will quietly lose or corrupt your valuable data once their true capacity is exceeded. They will seem to work at first and files will look okay in their folders, but you will eventually find some or all of your data corrupt when played, viewed, or otherwise read back.  Your valuable data will be irretrievably lost.<br /><br />As of Q3 2015, *nobody* makes true 2TB USB flash drives (but the market is full of fakes). The top available USB flash drive capacity is 1TB with the Kingston DTHXP30 HyperX Predator drive.  To achieve that capacity, Kingston mounts 8 memory chips, a controller chip and other necessary components on three interconnected circuit cards packed into a necessarily bulky package. Search for &#34;DTHXP30 review&#34; to see photos of the internals.  Those drives cost several hundred dollars, and the lion's share of this cost is the memory chips themselves. The circuit card, case, assembly costs, packaging, and distribution only add a few dollars.<br /><br />The Chinese are great at producing a wide range of interesting generic and novelty designs, but they don't have a magic supply of cheap memory chips. They also do not have the ability to make a 2TB drive using a single chip design as is contained in this drive. The technology is not there yet.<br /><br />There are lots of good flash drives available on Amazon, but only a few with true capacities above 256GB - all brand name drives costing several hundred dollars each. True capacity generic drives top out at 128GB for USB 2.0 drives (costing about $40), and the less common 256GB USB 3.0 generics (costing about $90). The market is also flooded with fake capacity drives offered at prices well below the true capacity drives.<br /><br />Be especially cautious of sellers that offer the same style in multiple sizes, but where each doubling in size is only 25% to 50% more than the size below.  For example, if the 64GB drive is only $5 more than the 32GB drive, or where the 128GB drive is only $10 more than the 64GB.  Real memory is not that cheap.<br /><br />If you do buy a low-priced drive, the first thing you should do is test the capacity using a utility called h2testw. This will fill the drive with data and then verify that it can be read back intact. The write phase usually completes without error. It is the verify phase that exposes the fake capacity. Testing the first 32GB is usually sufficient. For reasons stated above, you cannot trust the capacity displayed in Windows properties.<br /><br />You can also test by filling the drive up to at least 35GB with videos or other large media files and then *most importantly* check to see if they can be played back. If the capacity is faked, the first few will play, but past some point, the rest will be corrupt.<br /><br />Do not trust the capacity or space remaining shown in the properties display - that is exactly what is faked.<br /><br />Search for &#34;fake capacity flash&#34; using your favorite search engine for more information.engine for more information."
1,"Excellent value! I had some concerns the product might be too small and possibly scratch my ipad/iphone. That's a no on both! Solid construction, great look, excellent price. Well done Anker!"
1,Great product wish I got it when I was at the Apple Store but glad I waited to ordered it. Does what it says and looks great with anything!
0,"Lasted 10 months, OK for the price, I did by another one because the case is slim and fits the G4 nicely, I you need to take the cover off the phone to many times it tends to break very easy."
1,"Nice wallet case, Gorgeous delicate design and color."
-1,"Product did not come with instructions.  Huge air pocket on one side of the screen which appears to be getting bigger over time  Could be defect in phone or faulty installation (but without instructions, who knows)."
-1,"I experience the same problem it seems many of the other reviews had here. I bought from Groupon, it worked perfectly for a month and then out of nowhere I got the error on my phone saying it was not an Apple Certified product and it stopped working. Very disappointed."
1,"Works well, is durable. Sound quality isn't the best but it definitely gets the job done as a good shower speaker."
1,Love this wallet! Holds many credit cards and phone nicely. Room left for paper money as well.  Magnetic clip closure works great.  Nice find!
1,"Just what I was looking for.  For the price, it is excellent."
-1,"truthfully, I would love to give this case a good rating, but i just can not. It looks nice and feels good in your hand. The case does not seal all the way around the bottom portion of the phone. also, the camera lens is hard to clean. I did the waterproof test without the phone in it and it was successful. With the phone in it, it was in water for about 10 seconds before i could see water entering near the charger port. I have had two life proofs not and they are not worth even 1/3 of their cost."
-1,"The description of this item on Amazon.com is &#34;iansean Muset1c waterproof Wireless&#34;....<br />They arrived today and the instruction manual for the iansean Muset 1c says &#34;Warning:  Do not expose the headset to liquids.  Note:  liquid submersion voids the warranty.&#34;<br /><br />Um, false advertising much???"
1,"Small, sleek charger that comes with a high quality cable. Looks great, and works great too. 5 stars."
1,This is such a great case! I expected a LOT less. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality case for a low price. I definitely know I got my money's worth.
1,Nylon braid feels a little odd versus snotty wire but the cable appears to be well-made.
1,"Product was well made. I have only had for a couple days so I can't speak for durability but it would appear to be a quality product.<br /><br />The ability to go from lightning to mini USB is a nice feature.<br /><br />I will probably keep this in my bag as a backup cable because it is functional for several purposes. But for my primary charger cables I wouldn't want/need the extra charging type.<br /><br />And finally, the LED light. It is a nice feature and it is extremely bright in a dark room. I like my bedroom completely dark so I can't use this for my overnight charger. But it works great if you need to find your phone at night or if you need a night light!"
1,Needed this for a road trip. Excellent to keep GPS running in the car. WOrks a long time before a charge. Excellent.
-1,would not stick to windshield
1,Great case well made.  Customer service top notch.  They checked in to make sure I was very satisfied.  Great service.
1,"I only gave it 4 stars because -- honestly -- I can't find it in myself to love a small sheet of glass (c'mon Amazon!), but this item was absolutely perfect and I couldn't be happier with it. If you've never replaced an iPad 2 digitizer before, be forewarned: this is *not* an easy job, even for a relatively experienced DIY'er. Yeah, you'd be crazy to pay what Apple charges, but if you can find a local shop that's replaced at least, say, 10 of these, you might want to consider that option. But if you're planning to press forward despite these warnings, I have a huge time-saving tip for you: It's virtually impossible for a first-timer to remove the old (and I assume, cracked) digitizer without shearing off the Wi-Fi antenna. So do yourself a favor, and buy a new Wi-Fi antenna at the same time. They only cost, like, three dollars, and it'll be the best $3 you've ever spent."
1,Case looks great !!  Fits phone perfect
1,Excellent service. Great product.
0,Good case.<br />Mildly infuriating that the apple logo isn't in the middle of the cutout.
1,"I wanted a clear case with a nice design for my iPhone 6. After browsing for a few hours, I decided to buy this one. I was pleasantly surprised to receive the product 1 or 2 days earlier than scheduled. I can even say that the case it's a lot nicer than I expected to be.<br /> Highly recommended it!"
1,"The case functionality is great!  fit perfectly, protect iPhone, magnet works great.  White case looked very nice when it's new,  however, when it got dirty, it was impossible to take the dirt or any marks off of the case. I used all kinds of different chemicals, none worked.  Since I loved the functionality, I decided to purchase the same case with darker color."
1,It got here in good time.  It fit's well.
1,very good.
1,"Great product, easy to use, and gets rid of almost all cords. It's been a real life saver."
1,Awesome
1,Great
1,Works very well.
1,Very good
1,Very good
0,a little heavy
0,"It mounts great and has good range.  I used this on my motorcycle and the grip is sufficient to hold onto to even my giant phablet phone even over potholes at high speed.<br />Only negative for me is the fingers the fingers that grip also push the power and volume buttons.  I just can't find the right spot without the phone being so far offset in the grips that I then worry about it falling out.<br />I don't  consider this a product fault per se and I don't know how it can be mitigated, but it is something to be aware of."
-1,Dont fit tight enough and wont charge unless sitting idle on a flat surface - pointless to have a 10' cord if you cant move or use your phone - TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY- already in the trash!
1,"The front clear plastic scratches pretty bad, but I wasn't expecting that anyway. I would order the original clear plastic from Samsung."
1,It's really cute
1,Good one.
1,I love this case! I accidentally dropped my mp3 player in the toilet. Thank god the cover was on it because it saved it from having water damage. It is completely fine! I would recommend this product to anyone!
-1,very cheap looking and wont stay clipped on the phone I just threw it away
-1,Do not buy! Worst screen protectors I've EVER bought. They don't even stick to your screen.
0,Not the most comfortable earphones
1,Was as described and shipped quickly
1,"After some initial issues, they refunded my purchase price and then replaced the batteries with several more that worked great. Obviously great concern for customer satisfaction and a great value."
1,works great
1,This unit works PERFECTLY for my home stereo tied into my t.v. I get great sound quality and range. I have a huge master bedroom and never have a connectivity issue.
1,Great price and perfect fit!
1,amazing
1,"Does a great job of covering the front and back of your phone. If you pair this with a sturdy screen protector, you're phone would be indestructible."
1,"Great ziplock bag, it did what I expected to do, take some underwater video and pics. one of the previous reviews said something about inserting a folded paper towel inside in case water gets inside the bag, it came in handy, after a few hours water leaked in but collected in the paper towel. Make sure when is re used is completely dry. Used an LG phone."
1,Works great
1,"It works great.  However, it is not the easiest thing to put on.  It takes patience and pretty much a dust-free environment, but once you get it on, it is great for protecting your screen."
-1,Review should have stated not compatible with cases. I'm not going to take my phone out of it's case and put it back each time I work out.
-1,We ordered a case for an IPhone 4 and received a case for an IPhone 6..
1,As advertised
-1,sound quality was not up to par in addition to radio and USB functionality were faulty at best. back up camera and navigation we okay.
1,"i received my car cell phone charger & tried it right away! Yes, I am happy with it & will order again from this company."
1,it work very well for all my needs
0,Great product. But didn't work for what we needed it for.
0,"Difficult to get all of the bubbles out, have tried extensively, but some of them just won't clear out."
1,"I love this watch, my friends were complimenting me when they see the watch, am so happy with it and good customer service."
-1,this cost so much and really doesn't work like it is soppose to. I am shipping mine back.
1,Works great
1,"Fits nicely in the vent of my VW Jetta. I wish it was angled to face the drive, it faces perfectly perpendicular to the car. Not the biggest of issues, but still a small annoyance. Overall solid design and feature, my phone never feels like it's going to fall or slip out. Price is on the higher end for what it is, but it's a nice thing to have for hands-free driving"
-1,"This unit has a small plastic roller that is on the top clamp. Looks like the intent of this roller is to ease installment of the GPS into to cradle and to prevent the cradle from scratching the GPS case. The first time I installed the GPS into the RAM cradle, the roller popped out. I was able to reinstall it after many tries. This was disappointing because I have always like RAM products in the past. RAM needs a better design for this roller. You must be careful not to allow too much pressure to be applied to the roller or it will come out."
1,"Love it!  However, the Led light went out on one side only after 2 weeks."
-1,Bad design. Sits off back of head and not adjustable. The ear buds constantly slip out of my ears. Weird charger.
1,I love it
-1,"I had quite a bit of trouble with this product.  I normally love Sony products, so I was hoping that phone functions well.  This phone froze quite en, extremely slow response time  to the point not usable compared to my other phone - iPhone.  I tried to factory reset or limited the number of apps to very minimal, still no good.  I finally gave up on it and decided to purchase older model of iPhone with the same price I paid to purchase this phone on Amazon. Very disappointed."
1,Perfect
1,"Very good camera, however, the holder that attaches to the windshield is poorly constructed, broke within 2 weeks of use.  Customer service immediately took care of the problem and replaced the holder.  Very good overall experience."
1,Loved this product!  Can take it anywhere and it folds down to a decent size!  #Selfies have never been so easy!
1,"I love this and it is top quality for a great price, hasnt ripped or been scratched up from dropping it or anything."
1,"I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE ITEMS THAT I BOUGHT,GOOD PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH,FAST DELIVERY,GREAT PRODUCTS.<br /> DEFENTLEY 5 STARS."
1,"Protected my phone from numerous drops, but scratches and chips easily."
1,Am so impressed. These covers are even better than I expected. Perfect fit on my note 4.
1,"Beautiful case for iphone 6 plus. Great fit with some corner protection around the phone. It's a hard case with a very nice sheen finish to it, and I love the Disney tsum tsum prints which is very nicely printed. Definitely a plus for Disney tsum tsum lovers."
0,It move a lot...
1,Better than expected!
1,"love it, loved the color and the feel"
1,Great for the cost
1,This is my second purchase. The product still working out great like the first set.
-1,"I got this and used it once and it did work fast. It sat around for a while and when I needed to recharge it it wouldn't charge. I thought it was the cable. I wrote them and they replied (English does not seem to be their first language) and said it probably needs to be replaced - to send it in on my nickel and if it needed replacement they would reimburse my shipping and send me a new one. I still think it's the cord. I'm not willing to chance that I'm right and they won't replace my shipping fee. It's not worth the trouble. I will look for a better one, and while I'm at it, one that weighs a little less. This thing is/was heavy."
1,"I bought this case for my son and he loves it.  The case raises a little from the screen, giving it some more protection."
1,good for price
1,Works well.  We take it camping and it gets us through a few days
1,"Does what it should, quick charges my phone. Better priced then the OEM quick charger"
1,It charges! It also mows my lawn.
1,"Great size, easy access,"
1,"Nice product, I don't use the credit card holder so no concerns with scratching.  Fits the phone well and all the buttons are easy to access.  Only four of five because the front cover feels cheep and is already starting to wear, but acceptable since it was so cheap."
1,"[[VIDEOID:1daa652d4401127e4c9c520c61eaba18]] Please see the video for more info.<br /><br />Basically unless you have a really wide or really thick phone this should work well for you. It allows for single handed operation and it fits without damage to the CD slot. Once installed it remains firmly in place.<br />Adjustments are simple and offer a variety of angles, not much to dislike about it unless as stated your phone just doesn't fit.<br />I like that it doesn't really block too much in my particular setup and it allows for no blocking of my air vents...something I really try to avoid as much as possible when looking for a mounting solution.<br /><br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review."
1,"These are wonderful.  I forget that they are on my neck.  I have misplaced several many pairs of headphones but not these.  I love that they are wireless as far as no attachment to my physical phone.  The volume, on and off and skip buttons are easy to get to.  The clarity is GREAT.  I would definitely purchase again.  Plan on purchasing my son a pair in a few weeks."
1,This product is awesome. It cleaned up my charging station. I have a household with 9 people all with phones and tablets. Charges devices very quickly.
-1,"It took weeks for the Chargers to arrive. Then, none of them work! Cheap for a reason."
1,perfect fit! adds additional protection to my sapphire screen.
1,"This product works very well. For me, Choetech products have always worked well for me. After trying several other brands, I always come back to this brand. Have not had issues to date."
1,"Should fit any S4 variant EXCEPT the S4 Active. Should not matter if you have the T Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, or AT&T model in the US or the international model elsewhere. All of the S4's (Except the Active) were built on the same form factor.<br /><br />The purple battery doors were a special version available for the Sprint model. Now all the extras are showing up for retail to anyone.<br /><br />I have the purple door on my T Mobile version S4. Fits fine. Works fine."
1,nice
1,Seems to lasr very well.  Time will tell for certian.
-1,Beware! it's not made for small arms
1,High Quality part extremely happy with the purchase
1,Love this mount.  It has worked perfectly!
1,works
1,Worked perfectly! Had it on my phone in 10 minutes!
-1,"Very difficult to program, manual was very hard to understand. I have had several Analog scanners but now most police are Digital. The Terminology in the manual is all new that is unfamiliar to me. After many hours of trying to figure it out I became frustrated and sent it back for refund."
1,Great case!
-1,"I just purchased this item and it is already cracked. Prior to purchasing this, I read the reviews and wished the company was making a better product than other customers had stated. Believe it or not, those comments about a cheaply made product is correct. I dropped the case and the top portion completely came off and cracked. Fortunately, I have a shatter proof screen protector and me $900 iPhone wasn't damaged."
1,Phones are too big now a days to not have some privacy. THIS Shield is amazing. You can also dim your phone more to add additional privacy but it's not necessary. I love that I can be on an airplane and not have to worry about the person next to me reading personal documents or looking at my screen. Great purchase at a great price!
1,"This product works as intended to protect my phone's screen. The only downside is that it doesn't completely adhere in the edges and after a few months of use it stars looking really bad. Dirt is deposited between the edges where this doesn't adhere to the class and becomes imposible to completely clean, so the only solution is to change the protector for a new one. On other phones and electronics, screen protectors seem to last much longer. This might just be the way the phone is curved, but I think the screenprotector could be designed to cover a little bit less area and that way the edges will stick better."
0,"I bought these knowing they are cheap. I like that they do isolate the sound but I wish they could be louder. They last about 4 months so if you purchase them, buy them in multiples because they will start to cut off calls, stop music, start voice search so whenever any of that happens, you know to get a new pair."
1,I love Anker product!  I found their support is superior and their products are great.  I bought this over 1 year ago - using every single day - still works great!!
-1,"The protective sheet did not separate on two of the three screen protectors.  The one that did separate was applied to cell phone, but it had little bubbles all over it that we could not remove.  Looked terrible.  We are trying a different manufacturer."
1,excellent
1,Product as expected.
1,Worked great would purchase again if needed. A lt cheaper than buying fro Verizon Store
1,This has to be one the best battery packs out there and delivery was unbelievable thank you
0,Well first of all this is not even the color I ordered :( this is light gray and green not dark blue and green. Other then that it seems to be good
1,"RECEIVED STARTED SOLDERED NEG. AND POS. 10 AWG RED ON CAPACITOR SIDE .<br />HOOKED UP TO BACK OF YAQIN MC-100B FOR 4 OHMS TERM. SOUND CRISP BETTER<br />THAN EXPECTED . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED , WILL BUY ANOTHER SET . LOVE THE CRISP<br />AND LOUD MATCHED/COMBO WITH DEFINITIVE 450 ."
1,I use this for camping to keep my iPhone charged.  I'm really happy with my purchase.  I like that there are size options and plan to get another larger unit in the future as an emergency power option for all the devices in the house.
1,my usb was damaged - called sharkk for replacement usb - they sent new mouse and usb - wow
1,"For the price this is a good upgrade from cardboard itself.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good wide FOV<br />Good build quality plastic<br />Magnet trap door that snaps<br />No fancy suction to hold mobile (like some other VR headsets), instead relies on friction between sponge pads and phone to keep it in place<br />Very small pincushion distortion<br />Mild chromatic aberration especially for its price<br />Wide IPD (i can put it on with my glasses on)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Uses Fresnel lens (although technically not an issue) causes nasty ghosting (halo) on images<br />Nose pad may be painful after long use<br /><br />Overall: Cant beat this performance for the price."
0,"If I knew my iPhone wouldn't fit into the arm band with the cover on it, I would never have purchased."
1,charges phone easily and effortlessly
1,"Love this screen protector. I dropped my phone really hard the other day and I thought I cracked my screen, ended up just cracking the screen protector. It did it's job. I went out and got another one. Better to be safe then sorry!"
1,Mounts securely to vehicle and increases range of radio.
1,Works good. No problems.
1,"Sent me the wrong battery at first but were quick to rectify the problem and send me a new one, even though it was from China. New and proper battery is now functioning well in the iPhone 5."
1,Perfect fit
1,"Great screen protector, I am very happy with the fit and the way it feels.  Everything is still crystal clear and the screen is much easier to clean!  I highly recommend the Anker glass screen protector!"
1,Love it
-1,I bought two of these.  Loved one for 20 days and it died.  Loved the other for 30 days and it died.  I heard the same thing from friends that ordered.  Sad because the cord is nice and long. Not a good product.
1,Thank you
1,"I bought this primarily for mounting one of the small dual band ham transceivers which have flooded the market the past couple of years and for this purpose it works quite well. It fits tightly enough in the cup holder and is sufficiently sturdy to handle the weight (about  6 oz) of these radios. Due to the position of the side controls on the radio I have to clamp the radio only by its bottom half which means I'm using only the top half of the clamp and am not using the bottom feet at all. Nonetheless, it holds the radio securely even when using the keypad. Of course, it handles my Galaxy S6 with no problem. I question whether it would work well for much heavier radios, but that's not what it's designed for so all in all I'm totally satisfied with it."
1,"Received this product about 1 year ago and have been extremely satisfied with its performance up until 2 months ago when 2 of the ports failed. Probably caused by a wireless charger I had connected to these 2 ports. I called Anker Direct customer service and was told they would ship to me a new replacement product. No mess, no fuss. Very satisfied overall with both the product and Anker."
1,Great buy and would definitely recommend to anyone. It's up to google to work on improving the OS in adroid wear so we can continue to enjoy this project.
-1,"all directions in Chinese. could not use it,waste of money!!!"
-1,"there is a scratch on the front screen and there are also two prominent bubbles, the back is nice though"
-1,"Plastic is very cheap on thin. The rubber outside comes off very easily and isn't tight. I definitely think that if I dropped it, the iPad wouldn't be protected. The kickstand works, but it's hard to pull it out. I don't know how many times you use it before it breaks off. To use it, you pull it out and 2 tiny metal rods hold it in the guide. Spend the more money and buy some protection. I don't recommend this to anyone, I just brought it to see if it was a diamond in the rough. But it's not."
1,Great quality. Fits perfectly.
1,Excellent product. Flawless installation. Especially appreciate the bubble removing squeegee.
1,"I bought these for my car as I have a charging port in the armrest console and didn't want a huge cable mess to deal with. I have had no problems with this product, and it's nice to have several color options. I keep a couple of these in my backpack for others to use while at work. Worth the money if you only need a short charging cable."
1,"Fits in case ,even with my otter box case on it"
1,My grandson loves it.
1,Just got the case and it's great so far... Love the color and material; it has good grip.
-1,"I bought this for my trip to Europe this summer. It seemed to charge in the sun the first time I left it out, and actually quicker than I expected, considering it was only getting a little light.  Since then, I have yet to get any solar charge. I placed it on my windowsill for a few days now and it hasn't charged at all. Definitely disappointed, especially since I planned on giving this to my boyfriend for his camping trips."
1,As described.  Easy to tune.
1,"Good fit, seems sturdy and looks good. Can't ask for more on just a cover"
1,As described; easy to apply
-1,Returned this product. Not a good fit.
-1,Do not fit properly in the ears keep falling off with slight movement of the head
1,"I received a discount for a fair product review.  Awesome screen protector, will recommend to others"
0,No vibration at the reception of a call
-1,It worked for 2 hours only. It wouldnt charge and I had to return.
1,So good I order four of it. A little disappointed I didn't order 5 so it would fit fine in the box at the same price of the total minimum shipping weight.
1,love it
0,"This was very tricky , loved all the warning labels as you go. Sort of got it done started to remove tape off of ribbon that makes it vibrate all of the sandpaper looking stuff was trying to come off JUNK!"
1,GREAT
1,I love it.
-1,I purchased this twice. Both times it cracked/shattered within a week. Very disappointed.
1,As advertised. Fast shipping. Slim case with good protection. Clear color is sophisticated looking.
1,Good charge extension for phone. Buttons pop off if it drops to hard and makes the phone a little difficult to use
1,The case was very fitting heavy duty but loved it it has protected my phone after several drops I think it'll be lasting a pretty long time and the color is so it's so easy to find well in your purse
1,"It may be my cell phone needs to be upgraded, but it seems that the charged batteries life expectency has diminished. I can not keep it charged that is why I purchased 2  batteries to insure I can keep the cell available."
1,Charges my devices nice and fast. It DOES NOT quick charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 however which I was led to believe it would from Q&A here. I assume this is proprietary or something not yet supported by Anker.  I'm keeping it though because its a decent solution for my many devices.
1,"My mom has been using this case every day for a while now and figured it's nice to leave a review. The phone fits very securely into the open-style case, even though it looks very flimsy it holds up well. It looks girly enough for her and she has no qualms about it when I asked."
1,Fast Shipping! Great Case!
1,"I received my iPhone 5C Case, MagicMobile® Cute Ultra Slim Protective [Hybrid Impact] Hard Durable Thin TPU Cover for Apple iPhone 5C Armor Shell [ Black - Red ]Case with Clear Screen Protector by MagicMobile and all I can say is quality. This was a great case for the price. if you are looking for a great case that offers great protection look no further.<br /><br />Five star product for sure. I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
-1,"The only reason i bought this band was because it was &#34;Red&#34;. Its not red, its a pink salmon color. It also collects animal hair and dust like crazy. However, considering its $40 less than the Apple brand ones its decent quality. You get what you pay for."
1,Exactly what I wanted.
0,It works. Very bulky.
1,"So excited to take this with me to my company's convention.  I have used it multiple times already and know my battery will drain in a big arena with thousands of people, so I was looking for something like this to help with charging.  The last convention everyone was scrambling trying to find somewhere to charge their phones.  This has already saved me multiple times. Love it!"
1,i really love this product i couldnt wait for it to arrive  as i love pink! it fit on my phone perfect! the pink color is beautiful and looks great on my phone! i received this product free for review and i definitely recommend it. its so cute!
1,"The absolute easiest screen protector I've ever applied.  Not one bubble!  Even without instructions, I had this on in less than two minutes and it's just perfect. Now let's see how long it lasts...."
1,"Tight fit for my Droid Ultra but it works even with the case on! Very comfortable fit, stays secure."
1,Burnt
1,Really enjoying my new case.
1,Shipped faster than expected. Love the colors.
1,Easy to use and attach. Keeps phone like new
1,Works Great! Haven't found any issues with this product.
-1,Broke after about 45 days.
1,awwsome...case very nice
-1,My Double Din stereo doesn't fit through opening.<br />Quite obnoxious to assemble with a detailed instructions manual that's just vague enough about which part is which to be confusing.<br />$15 wasted.  This will end up in the trash as I'll need to buy a different kit.
1,"Love the color and case, one thing i would advise is to put thin flap on card holder to make more secure and then it would get a &#34;10&#34;"
1,great feel and good leather..
1,"Cute case for my lil sisters phone, she loves it"
1,I got these cases in every color & the came before the expected delivery date😄😄😄😄
1,Great kit.  Worked well and came with lots of extras to make the process even easier.
-1,These things broke within 2 weeks or were not compatible with my IPhone 6.
1,Outstanding case<br />All leather<br />Only problem is belt loop<br />I had to carry to shoe shop to get more dependable belt loop
1,"Awesome and fantastic screen protector for Galaxy Note 2. Very easy to apply, shipping and packaging was great."
1,"***UPDATE 10.05.15*** 24 hours after my first review, a rep from Anker emailed me about the &#34;faulty&#34; cable. With very simple explanation, they were quick to replace it. Never really noticed a more persistent company that highly pursues customer satisfaction as they do. They sent me a new one and made follow up emails to make sure my new cable was working properly. I have no issues with the second one although it did bend a little bit not as bad as my first one. I'd give them another star for their great customer service.  I bought this in May, 2015. I guess I'm being nice with the 3 stars. 3 months later. I waited to make a review to see if the good reviews would hold up. Unfortunately, either I have bad luck with long cords (more than 3ft.) or just not really durable. I've bought a 5 pack with the 6ft cord, same brand, same issue.I've bought a white 10ft cord before from another brand and it worked great until it got dirty and turned black and it stopped charging. Decided to buy this with the great reviews but the plug to connect to the phone has been loose and wiggles frequently. One time I would charge overnight to wake up with no charge because it was either loose or just didn't charge unless you bent the cord to a certain position to charge, how frustrating, I haven't done that since I had a RAZr (yea remember those). In the beginning, it clipped right into the phone, very snug and tight, no wiggle. 3 months in, its not tight and hope to have my phone charge the next day. Would I buy another one, I'm not sure. 10ft & 6ft. Cord bad. My 3ft & 1ft cords still good but a little wiggle but not as bad, I'm sure it will not last a year."
1,"We got this for our daughter & she loves the color & kickstand! Seems durable but we'll see if it lasts the whole school year. Regardless, the price was right."
1,case has been great! i have used a similar product from noot with my s3 and that one is still in great condition! really like their products. light weight and durable!
0,Color starts to fade after a few weeks
0,The  first one that was received was defective and wouldn't charge the iphone or connect with the computer.  Returned it and the replacement seems to be working fine right now.
1,love it👌🏼
1,Great product use it every day
-1,"A fantastic bluetooth headset if you only use it indoors. If you want a bluetooth that works minimally well outside of an office setting? Forget about this device. The second there's the slightest gust of wind, you can forget about the person on the other end of your call hearing anything you're saying. It will sound like you're being swept away by a tidal wave of noise interference. Don't believe me? Record yourself through your bluetooth and play it back. I did, after numerous complaints from people I had spoken with over bluetooth. You'll be amazed, and not in a good way. In short, the Plantronics Voyager Edge has the worst wind and noise cancellation I've ever experienced from a mobile device or accessory. For an item of this price, this is simply unacceptable. This is the last time I will buy anything designed by Plantronics."
1,Very Durable!!!
1,Ive hade this charger for over 2yrs and still works great best money ive spent
1,This case is durable and sturdy my friend threw it at the wall.....it left a dent in the wall but the phone and case is perfectly un harmed I love this case
1,worked as advertised
1,Great phone at a great price.
1,Protects my daughters phone well enough.  I just wish it were easier to take off for when we need to get to the battery.
1,Real Apple cords
1,"I bought 1 of these and 3 months later, bought an additional one. i used them for a 30hour road trip. I found that they were more effective than using the car charger. I found that as with any charging, it was best if minimal apps were running while charging and it would charge fast. I could get a 50% charge on my Galaxy S4 in about an hour when not using it."
0,Ita ok for the price losses connecting sometimes and doesn't last as long add it says it does dies just after about 3 hours
0,"Less than two weeks into using these cords with my Iphone 5S I started getting the 'This accessory may not be supported&#34; message. Most of the time I can just unplug and replug and it will work. There are times when it does work right away only to switch later, which is annoying because if I don't catch it, I don't realize that it's not charging until I need to use my phone again. It's a good price for 4 but it might be worth the investment to buy better quality ones next time."
1,I have had mine for almost a month.  It's holding up great.  I would have preferred a more substantial wristlet.
0,"It doesn't stink so that is always plus .<br />& it came early.<br />I had a regular color of the panda.. I just thought it would thicker .. It's all skinny and thin i got it because I liked the pink , so that's a plus"
-1,I hate this case it was great at first then it got a big bubble and all the water evaporated and now all my sparkles and stars are stuck.
1,It's perfect! Fits my phone perfectly. The color is so pretty! I get compliments all the time
1,A great product which i already have one for my grandchild which he loves it. tks again
1,"This case just came today and it fits really well on my phone.  I like the design, too.  It's relatively simple but effective.  It's a hard case so it's definitely more durable, and it really relieves a lot of the worries of damaging my brand new phone.  Unfortunately, the power button isn't working for me.  The volume buttons work fine, and it's possible to turn the phone on and off by touching the button on the bottom of the screen, but the case's power button doesn't press hard enough to push against the actual power button on the phone.  Still, it's a nice case, and definitely should hold up against daily use with my phone.<br /><br />EDIT: After a week or so of use I'm revising my review to say this case is awesome.  I've dropped my phone 3 times and a few chips on my case, but absolutely no issues with my phone.  The power button is working, almost a little too well... (I accidentally bump it from time to time.)<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in return for my honest review."
-1,I bought 2 of these on July 12 2015 and the touch screen on both of them went out already. How can we fix this problem?
1,Heavy Duty!<br /><br />Pros:<br />My phone is now armored like a sherman tank<br />All ports are well covered to keep out dust<br />edges and backing are made of an awesome rubber shock absorber<br />Cornings gorilla glass of the front cover<br />bolts together with small alan head<br />comes with two tools and extra bolts<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very Heavy<br />Large foot print<br />charging port is hard to gain access (using apple brand chargers and its still a squeeze)<br />camera/home button not covered<br />alan head tool that came with phone started to strip
1,Nifty phone holder. Perfect for my Google maps app.
1,"I was skeptical about this product at first and spent weeks comparing phone similar stands and I kept coming back to this one.  I was looking for something that would sit on my desk at work, between my monitors, and not obstruct my view.  I wanted my iPhone 6 plus to sit in the landscape/horizontal position so I could have it charging, hook up headphones to listening to music, adjustable viewing angle, and not have it laying down flat on my desk.<br /><br />This stand is very solid and appears to be made of aluminum.  There is silicone padding on the bottom of the stand and as well as where you device rests on.  There are 3 rivets holding this thing together.  One for the swivel and 2 for the tilting portion of the stand.  They are very tight and I haven't had any issues with them so far.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the stand, and for the price, I was willing to take a chance and it paid off.<br /><br />On a side note.  My iPhone doesn't have a case on it so I can't speak to how a particular case would work with this stand.  Also, I haven't tried it with tablets yet.  I'll update this review once/if I do."
1,"This product is exactly as described. You can't ask for better than that. One thing, it ships from China. Took 2 1/2 weeks to get to us. If you can wait that long, I recommend. If fits my bluetooth earpiece like a glove. :)"
1,It is great! Works wonderfully
1,Nice Fit.
1,Love it
1,"Been using it for one week now, works great"
1,very good
1,Really nice & comes up around sides to protect front if phone is dropped.
1,"I wear it everyday and it does help monitor your activity and promotes a healthier lifestyle,,,,,,, however it does loose connectivity to the phone and misses activity you do so can be inaccurate when you know you have done more than it says. Principal is good but needs improving to be reliable."
-1,"Pr Mine lifted on the edges pretty badly but I ignored it and used it for 8 months. It fractured and made a line from left to right when i dropped it at waist height on a carpeted floor, when it was in a rubber case. Also developed a chip months earlier, which is where the crack stemmed from. It did do a great job resisting scratches, and from other reviews and research there doesn't appear to be any good glass protectors for this device, so maybe this is acceptable for this industry these days. Won't be getting another $10 from me though."
1,"It's not easy to find a great charger for the earlier generation Apple products - so I jumped on the opportunity to purchase this portable battery pack. My husband has an iPhone 5S and an 'older' iPad, he was immediately impressed with how compact it is and how many plugs it included.<br />This is a product he immediately put in his briefcase since it arrived. On a daily basis he drives over 100 miles for work so no more dead phone or waiting to get into the car to recharge.<br /><br />Note: I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
1,Very nice.
1,"Excelent product it charges very fast! Looks great,  charges two devices at the same time"
1,"Great Product to have in your car to power or charge laptop, tablet & phones."
-1,no good
1,"Great product - keeps me motivated to reach my fitness goals  -  This one was a gift<br />I brag about my Jawbone UP  to anyone who will listen<br />I had the bracelet  and  was not entirely happy . When it burned out I was reluctant to  get another Jawbone product  - glad  I stuck with you  -<br />The Up  is an improvement over the bracelet -  I kept losing the cap and  had  to keep a charger at home, in the car and at work.<br />I did not mean to go on and on.  BUT- the Smart Coach ... thumbs up  R&D  I.T.  people  -  like having my own personal coach .<br />Thank you and Regards,"
-1,"At first this case was great. It looked sleek and looked perfectly, however over time this case has literally fallen apart. I have gone through 4 of these things all replaced under warranty but decided to get another brand after my last one died. The button can stop working, the kickstand breaks off, the case chips easily and the case stopped charging my phone when plugged in. Works well in the short run, but get ready for it to break after a month!"
1,"Not bad, but it is not the best. However, considering the price, it could be a good bargain."
1,Tuff well made little cord !!
1,It's awesome
-1,Battery only last about 1 1/2 hr.<br />Great sound but battery doesn't last the 5 hrs it said that it does
1,"Great case. Fit perfectly on my phone, shipped fast and is very rugged without making it too bulky."
0,There ok but really hard to keep air bubbles from forming during application.
1,works great.
1,Nice!
1,Fits very well.  Love that the color of my phone comes through.
1,"good phone case, thank you!"
1,Love  it
1,love  this  i  fixed my  cell phone myself  with the  help  of  U-tube  saved alot  of money  couldnt believe how  easy this  was  to  do
-1,"the software is horribly un-user friendly.  i dread having to add music/files.  compared to sandisks sansa zipclip, its the pits.  i hate the display, i hate the organization on the ipod...  the whole thing is counter-intuitive to use.<br /><br />  well, the things i do like is that it holds 20 gb and i got it used, cheap.  thats probably the only things that are good about it. i had a zipclip before and loved it, but there is a defect in how they manufacture the batter connection, so they are all destined to fail, and i wouldnt do that again.  at least the ipods construction is good.  useability on this model is miserable, though.<br />  oh, i hate the thumb mechanism to select files.  man, i dont know why they cant make one like the old 8 bit nintendo controllers.  that would be SO much easier."
1,Perfect
0,Item arrived as described. 2 things that disappointed me. 1-it isn't very loud. Barely louder than my phone so not good for large spaces. 2-it does not hold a charge for very long.
-1,It arrived defective
0,These are good as backup cables at a great price and seem to be quite compatible with the iPhone 5s.  Not too sure about the &#34;lightning&#34; part...personally I think they take rather a long while to reach a full charge.  If you want a true lightning cable check out the Zerolemon cables!  I needed a longer cable and ordered their 10' lenght...great quality and I can't get over how fast it charges my phone!!!
-1,"I was given this as a gift for Christmas about a year and a half ago.  i have to admit it was pretty cool and worked well for about the first 6 months.  Then the case on the phone started to fall apart and before long the rubber casing wasn't staying on.  So i just decided to deal with it for a while as i never really removed the case unless i needed to gte to the battery or card in the phone. Eventually, the rubber outline on the case was just too flimsy to use, so i came the Amazon and got a replacement case a few months ago and i was happy again.  However, the base would no longer charge the phone.  That was annoying enough, but now, if i plug in a cord charger to the case, that will no longer charge the phone either. Needless to say, i am moving on.  Good Luck!"
-1,Lots of vibration which makes looking at directions cumbersome.
1,"Great back up or emergency batteries. These hold a charge just as long as the original samsung battery. Down side, when taking photos with your camera you can not use your flash. If you try to take a photo using your flash your phone will shut down. I use these batteries when my Lomui 3800 mah battery is getting low. Just keep one in my wallet and the other in my back pack. Once a month I discharge them and then recharge them to keep the batteries healthy and ready for emergencies."
1,"Great sound for the money, fast delivery."
1,Good product. Good shipping.
1,works well
-1,It did not stick<br />In frustration  i just threw it a away<br />For the 6 dollars i spent on it i could not be bothered  to send it back
1,It's fits well
0,The lever that clicks the side button (ringer/vibrate) on and off broke so I had to stop using the case..
1,Good!
1,Love the unit
-1,finger sensor doesn't work screen protector kept coming off horrible quality I wouldn't recommend cheaply made
0,I bought to screen protector as a gift. My friend says it fits perfectly and looks nice. Easy to install. Be aware that it's not anti-finger. But overall Good product!
-1,I'm am absolutely not happy! This is not a straight talk phone and I bought two. Now I will have to pay an extra $60 per phone to get it activated.
1,"I've never used a smartwatch before so when I got this, I wasn't really sure how useful it would be.  I have a Galaxy Note 4 in a wallet case, so it's a bit cumbersome to open and view notifications.  This watch has been super useful for just quickly checking whatever text or email I was just sent or who's calling without having to dig into my pockets and mess with my big phablet.  The coolest thing I've used with it so far is with navigation.  When Google Navigate is running, I can have an app on my pebble that will tell me what the next turn is, how far, and it vibrates when I'm getting close.  The only major downside I've come across so far is that the screen has tearing issues occasionally.  Lines will occasionally get scattered around across the screen randomly.  It's pretty easily fixed though by just navigating to a different menu and back again."
1,The charger works just fine it got here on time so thank you for that So in till next time this order gets a five stars yaya awsome
1,The silicone skin was good!
-1,"Advertises that this works with the passport max but it doesn't. Let me rephrase that, it will hold the max, however it doesn't lock in place and slides off easily. Making u turns had thrown my detector all over the car. I'm surprised my detector hasn't been damaged because of this."
1,This thing for fun))  I like it)
-1,"Product is not as resilient as the OEM. Perfect install, then placed into my brothers pocket the morning he went to work, sat down in his car, heard a slight crack looked at his phone... Cracked!!! He bought his G2 new when it came oh so long ago... Oh well, what can you do."
1,like perfect fit
-1,"Small phone, don't like it.  Thanks!"
1,Really good tools install this if you have the steady hands
1,Had an issue with product...but Wireless Solutions are sending me a replacement. Excellent customer service!!
1,"Phone arrived quickly, reasonably priced, works wonderfully!!!  It does not seem able to hook up with my Verizon back up assistant....  First world problems!  I will have to enter all my phone numbers by hand!  Sigh!  My original G'zOne lost the ability, but otherwise  still works fine for my daughter.  Might be a Verizon thing?  Please note, as rugged as these phones are, they are not Labrador Retriever proof!"
1,Always buy these ones they sound good
1,Best case that I have ever bought for a cell phone!!! it fits perfect!!
1,Thanks
1,"Great sound for the money, fast delivery."
0,"If you love taking pictures with different angles and affects, then you sure are gonna love this product! its tiny so its easy to carry around and easy to work. the only thing i felt that was hard and annoying with this product was the set up and the directions. the directions were confusing and the set up seemed difficult from the directions. overall , its a good thing to buy."
1,Nice!
1,Thank you I love my case
0,They aren't clear and they don't stick very well. For the price it will work.
-1,Does not fit in the CD slot as well as others. It causes any device I place onto it to jiggle while driving or idle. While most of these on Amazon are virtually the same; I'd rather spend even a few more dollars on anther brand.
0,"Definitely protecting my phone,which is a big plus with my destructive tendencies...it is heavy, however, I am getting used to the weight. There are some problems with reception, but not many places where I spend a lot of time. Assembly was a little time consuming. The only thing that really bothered me was that the tool for the allen head screws, which is about the same size as the tools in an eyeglass repair kit, came screwed INSIDE the outer shell of the phone case, the screws needing to be unscrewed with the same tool inside for complete assembly."
1,"Great product, but had to find out the hard way that wifi calling only works on the T-Mobile phones."
1,One of the best most fun cases I've ever had!
1,Awesome! Works great with my Lumia 920.
1,It's good!
-1,This cable is poor quality and 39&#34; long (not 4ft as advertised).
1,"I ordered from Fixing_DIY just over two weeks ago. I waited on posting a brief review in order to avoid giving a premature positive review; just in case there were any problems. This has actually been the best screen replacement that I've purchased. No light bleed; Accurate colors; Matte black frame matches my phone; Plus it's responsive. The &#34;wedge/lifting&#34; tool however was pretty flimsy. Easy to switch between the two cases because parts were pre-installed for easy transfer. I ordered overnight shipping and received my package sooner than expected. Two minor nitpicks: the earpiece is too deep into the glass and the USB port has a very snug fit; it's sometimes a slight struggle to put in. Really no big deal, I can still hear people I'm talking to perfectly fine, and I can still charge my phone. Other than that, it's the best screen replacement I've purchased. Buy this item, I recommend it.<br /><br />Update: I dropped the phone on concrete from doorknob height a few days ago and nothing happened to the screen. Just some dings on the frame."
-1,Way TOO large for my earpiece and it's cheaply made.
1,Battery worked and was perfect size
1,It's fine
1,It works as intended.
0,"This phone is fairly intuitive and easy to use, however, I started having memory issues after a couple months of owning it. I figured out how to increase the memory and disable some of the extraneous apps, but I have to check the memory every couple of weeks to make sure it doesn't start freezing up on me. I would not suggest buying this phone."
0,bluetooth with noconnect with bluetooth with no problem this is one of the best watches that I bought I will recommend this to anyone
1,"Great case! I thought it was not going to last through the many times I drop my phone, but it gives me great protection and it took several months of drops before I even managed to nick the case. Looks great! The gold is the same tone of gold as the gold iPhone so they look nice paired together. Very lightweight and smooth, but offers a great deal of protection!"
1,This is my favorite car charger for any cell phone that uses microUSB. The cable is coiled so it doesn't get all over the place yet it'll stretch as far as you need it. The light is a good indicator that the charger is plugged in correctly (how many times have we thought we had it plugged in but it wasn't?). The charge rate is acceptable and I've bought maybe five of these over the years and they've all worked as advertised.
1,good charger but the cord is too short
1,Always loosing my headset and this is the best.  always buy this one
1,Great headphones.
-1,After installing I put pressure on the corner to make sure it had a solid fit and it cracked. Must be paper thin glass....
0,NEEDS WORK fas a product.
1,"It does what it is supposed to. Reviews on many similar products had me wary, but this product turned out to be the right choice. This product does automatically connect to your phone."
1,"I love it. I've been using it since the day I got it. It fits well on my ear and has a spare of ear strap for those who has small ear. Quality of sounds, the easy setup, is what I needed"
1,"Great Selfie Stick I definitely recommend it. I take selfies every day with my friends and family, I will surely but another one for my Girlfriend. This Selfie Stick is easy to use and light-weighted. It is easy to carry anywhere with its compact size and is compatible with either iPhone or any other cell phone."
-1,This case is HORRIBLE! it DOES NOT WORK! My son cracked his phone screen the first week he got this case.<br />It did NOT protect his phone at all and now we have to replace a screen and pay an insurance deductible.
1,Awesome
0,"Revising my review. It's glitchy and crashes often. Has trouble with apps. Tried to install Pokemon Go and it took far too much effort. Now that the app is installed, it crashes constantly.    Great phone. I was nervous when it said &#34;Euro Sim Card Only&#34; but so far, the only problem I've run into is that it doesn't work with US LTE networks. Data transfer speeds are good. Excellent ergonomics. It takes awhile to get used to the Android system, but aside from that I like everything about it."
1,"If want to use your smartphone as a SatNav in your car then some sort of mount is essential. Unfortunately although there's a wide variety of universal phone holders on the market a lot of them aren't very good. Most use a clamp design that can be awkward when fitting or removing your phone and many aren't very stable and tend to vibrate when driving. Build quality can also be a problem with many falling apart after prolonged use.<br /><br />1byone have gone with an innovative design which consists of a small magnetic disk which pushes onto any car air-vent via 4 rubberized fingers. This proved very easy to fit and stays in place very securely.<br /><br />Secondly you get a choice of two magnetic plates depending on whether you use a case on your phone or not. There's a round magnetic plate that sticks directly onto the back of your phone, or a larger rectangular plate that sits between the case and your phone.<br /><br />As my phone has a case I went with the second option and as the plate is very thin it fitted nicely between the layers of my dual-layer case. Once you pop the case back on you'd never know the plate is there - until it jumps into place as it gets close to the air vent mount.<br /><br />My phone is on the larger side but the magnetic bond had no problem holding it in place. There were no issues with it slipping off while driving although it would sometimes rotate slightly to the left or right. The phone remained stable while driving with very little vibration.<br /><br />Attaching and removing the phone couldn't be quicker or easier, and the mount's rubberized coating prevents any damage to your phone or case. When not in use the small mount with it's discreet 1byone logo matches in well with the look of the car dashboard.<br /><br />Overall I was very impressed with 1byone's air vent car mount. My previous phone holder is a clamp design which sticks to the windscreen but this is much more convenient. If you don't use a phone case then not everyonewill be happy to stick a black disk to the back of your phone but if you're willing to do so then this will work very well. For case users there really is no downside and as it's well made and very inexpensive I can highly recommend it."
1,"I really need this for my workday. I work out in the field and can't get to a charger. This one is awesome and so portable. It looks very sophisticated so I don't mind pulling it out of my bag and charging my phone. I would recommend this for those who can't always get to a charger/outlet to charge their phone during the workday, play day or any day."
1,"Although I really appreciate the fast delivery of the product, it was a little misleading. According to the information as described and matching photos,  I was looking for the black covers/tips to come with the clear ones that were delivered. Other then that, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
0,Didn't care for the color
1,fit perfect
-1,"Very cheap quality, carriage didn't align properly with the apple on my phone. I threw it out right after trying it on my phone"
1,"Works great. I have an Incredible 4GLTE with a case on it. It fits very snug, but it fits. Seems to be made of pretty heavy material as well. Looking forward to see how long it lasts. The two belt clip options are very good too. Seems to be a well made product."
1,"I love this case. I wanted something that wasn't colorful because I like the look of the iPhone6. The rubber around the edges is perfect for having a good grip on my phone. Before using this case I was constantly concerned with dropping my new phone. I couldn't hold it in one hand without it slipping out, but now I can get a good handle of it. It also allows you access to all the buttons, switches, etc. I would recommend this case."
1,Very happy with the purchase. I have paired to both my iPhone and Apple watch and they are comfortable plus have very good sound.
-1,When I received the product it was just what I was hoping it was going to be. Easy to mount and easy to set how best fits your needs and the part that wrapped around the phone was well cushioned so it won't hurt the phone. Unfortunately after using it on the first day the spring popped out and it will no longer hold my phone so I sent this product back.
-1,Stop working after a month don't get
1,as expected
1,The cables seem very sturdy. Shipping was quick. An awesome product at a great price.
1,This product far exceeded my expectations.  My phone remains in place while I am driving and using it as a GPS.  I would order another Arkon Friction Dash Smartphone Car Mount.  I own and radio and TV station and I am letting people know how satisfied I am with this product.
0,The case is a very nice case.  My only complaint is it covers the bare minimum of the sides of the phone.  If it went up a bit higher it would be more secure and give much more protection.  It was a great price and it arrived much quicker then estimated.  It is a great case for a back up.  If they made one with higher sides I would definitely  order another one.
-1,Bought this for an old iPhone 4.  Case is slightly too large for the phone and the antennas came off within 2 weeks.
-1,"The sound is good, but tends to break up and stutter a lot.. not very smooth listening"
-1,"DONT BUY IT , it breaks too fast ."
-1,I broke it in like 4 days. But I dunno if it's just me or the case.
-1,"After reading all of the reviews and having an approximate 94% approval rating, I was totally hyped up to check these out. when I get them and opened them up, I was a little put off. They do look cool, but they are completely made out of plastic. They feel very, very cheap, solid, but cheap. There was no charge on them at all. Typically, there is a partial charge or at least enough to power them on. No problem, I took the supplied cable and charged them for 2 hours. I saw the red light lit indicating a charge, and then the blinking blue light indicating a full charge. I put them in my ears and I was unable to power them on. I wasn't sure what was going on. I plugged them back into power and then was able to turn them on. I put them in pairing mode and started playing music. The sound was very good and they had a good fit. I continued to let them charge for another two hours and after that I was still unable to turn them on without being plugged into a charger. I am very pleased with the replacement / return process. Maybe I got some out of a bad lot or something. I am not sure what happened. With all of these positive reviews, I am very disappointed in what I ended up getting."
1,"Love this case, got it as a gift for my Husband for his Birthday, He's so picky!! Hard to please and buy for, This is a very Nice case, Wish they had it in Pink or Purple sparkly girly something, that'd be cool! 😉"
1,Very durable and super cute!
1,Perfect
1,I like it. It covers my headphones jack and charger port . But not the speakers. Pretty hard too open and put it on.
0,"Nice and cheaper wireless headphones. Hurts my ears after wearing for +1.5 hours though. Can hook up to multiple gadgets (laptop, iPad, phone..)"
-1,Ordered and paid for three of the Black cases only received two cases
-1,The case I received was broken and won't stay closed onto the phone all the way.
-1,There is no way to replace just this glass as it is glued to the digitizer. I had to return this and buy the digitizer and touch screen glass as complete unit.
1,This is very good portable charger.  It is always ready to charge your portable devices -- simply plug in your USB cord and plug in your device and charging starts immediately.  It will easily charge your smart phone several times before it needs to be re-charged itself.  It will also charge an iPad or other tablet at least once before needing to be re-charged.
1,"I love this case, it's very durable and spunky! Seller was amazing also!!"
1,Nice for battery backup
-1,"From the past reviews, I thought this was a score at the price.  But I am not getting the same quality that I read about.  I have had numerous complaints about the sound quality from my customers on the other end.  From sounding like a bumblebee to on a very distant speaker phone.  My business relies on my cell phone, and I can't seem to find the right headset that works flawlessly.  Any suggestions...."
1,This little speaker sounds great and worked perfectly for turn by turn audio directions on my bicycle. It's also great around the house!
1,"It's a snug fit, but it works."
1,Great Product
1,Love the feel.  Strong and great fit.
1,"We took our cases on a river rafting trip and they worked perfectly. Took pictures with my iphone 6 in it and it worked well. We did the recommended test in it first. I purchased a 3rd one to give to a friend. As an update, we've used this several times.  It also is great to carry your phone in when biking or hiking and then you don't have to find a pocket and enables you to use your phone for photos quickly.  I recently used it while biking in Colorado, and it gave me quick access to take pictures for at brief stops. I've also used it while out sightseeing by storing my ID and credit cards in it as well.  It's very handy!"
1,work very well
1,Functions very well as an iPhone 5 charger.
1,Wonderful way to charge my new Nexus phone.  Charges the phone without the need to remove the clear plastic case. Great value!
1,I love the case I bought for galaxy grand prime. Its perfect.
1,Tech21 has the best phone protection that doesn't get stuck in your pocket and isn't too bulky. I cannot tell you how many times I have dropped my phone. Heck I even dropped it as I was walking one time and kicked it across a parking lot. Tech21 was scuffed up but the phone was fabulous! Thanks Tech21!
1,"Good, light weight charger"
1,Good quality. My 11-yr old daughter loves it.
1,Great
-1,Not as good as I'd hoped
0,"Easy installation, but has already failed."
1,Love this phone
-1,"Item arrived EXTREMELY past due, it does not come out of the case properly, the screen protector is VERY CHEAPLY made & doesn't cover the screen properly, and the case itself- is only good if it is dropped. I would NOT recommend this product to others."
1,Love it works good!!
-1,broke within the first couple of days
1,I've used a lot of different screen protectors on the various phones I've had over the years & this has got to be the best one I've ever had!! Was a little intimidated when I saw how thick it was but installation was very easy. Just make sure you follow the instructions and install it in a clean dust free area and you won't be disappointed!!
0,Simple design which is what I prefer. The enclosed screen cover applied smoothly and with almost no bubbling. The plastic edge of the case is a little loose fitting with the N5 installed. As a result it tends to click slightly when I push the power button to turn off the screen.
-1,It's ok but after you use it and take it off you phone a couple times it not that much off a water proof
1,"This really is a great product. I thought the base was a little bulky when I first got it, but after &#34;installing&#34; it, I find I barely notice it's presence. It clips into the CD slot nice and securely, and maintains a secure grip on the phone (iPhone 6). The arm is firm enough that the phone doesn't move around and change it's position, even on bumpy roads, but I never find myself fighting and fumbling to find the right position. One-handed operation may take a little bit of technique, but is rather simple when placing and positioning; taking it out is easier with two hands, but still manageable with one.<br /><br />The main thing to keep in mind is the location of your CD slot, and whether your phone will cover up any other controls or displays. I'm using this in a 2006 F150 with a center console and a factory six-disc changer (that has never seen a single disc). As long as I place the grip at the bottom of the phone, I can still clearly see my radio display and access all buttons."
-1,"Sorry, does not work as good as the regular, 1 year old used, one I had before. I had it switched over at a Verizon store and charged it carefully. I still have to charge it daily, even with minimum (1 or 2 short calls) daily usage."
1,Muy buen producto
-1,Bought this product because I thought it be a good quality coming from Samsung but when it arrived only one cord works and the other one works intermittently. Be warned there are better products out there for less.
0,what i got wasn't exactly as the picture described (the film does not wrap around the buttons) strangely this was a reason for choosing this over others for me. installation wasn't easy but got it right after messing one screen up.
1,Nice!
1,Works perfect! Love it.
-1,Screen cracked within two weeks of purchase
1,"This is the best power adapter I ever used for my iPhone. I bought one 8month ago and never had any problems. This time I bought another one for my work place. This change the iPhone so first! This is real, great product!"
1,charges all my devices and is small for the capacities
1,"Sometimes the charging can be a bit tricky, I have plugged it in with the correct amperage and left it charge overnight and it was still not charged. this has happened a few times now, but every time I charge my phone with it, it works great and the flashlight isn't too bright but its just a power bank, I didn't buy it expecting it too be super bright. its a nice little bonus thrown in, its also nice to be able to check the battery status of your power bank."
1,am very satisfied with my item. It was well wrapped and arrived on time.
1,This was the easiest screen protector install I've ever done. The hinge technique is simple and intuitive. Definitely worth it.
1,It works as advertised
1,"Great case, slim design and easy to pull out of your pocket but still provides a secure grip feel.  I had a screen protector on the front and back already.  I installed with the protectors still on there and it worked for a little while till the built in protector started sticking to the previously installed one.  I also noticed that some dust kept getting under the attached screen protector.  I removed the case and carefully cut the attached protecting film off the case and left the previously installed one.  Works perfect."
1,"I love the armbands for my smart phone.  I bought these so that I would quit forgetting to put it in the bag.  Now I have one in each car and one for the bag.  They are super comfortable.  The only part I have never understood, is that spot marked for a key.  I don't own a key that would fit in that spot.  I loved getting these in two days from Amazon.  I can start my week of right!"
1,Charges all my mobile devices fast. Very handy.
1,Its nice product
1,Easy Installation.  Looks good.
0,It was exactly what I wanted but....it was extremely large for my phone.  I would like full return or credit on my account.
1,Works well<br />Would be fantastic if it held more than four cards
1,"I bought this phone about a year and a half ago and am very pleased with it. It's a very sturdy phone and has withstood countless falls without a case, including falls on asphalt and down a hill. When it drops the back cover of the phone comes off and the battery falls out, but I simply put the battery back in and clip the back on. The screen has never even cracked. It continues to work like always; I don't even worry when I drop my phone without it's case anymore. Also, I brought it kayaking with me once and stuck it in the waterproof compartment, but it got a little wet anyhow. When I opened the phone the inside was quite wet, so I quickly took out the battery, dried it off, blew in the cracks, and set it in front of a fan. It was fine!   Besides durability, this phone is very good looking, especially in white. The white shows dirt faster, but this is very easy to remedy, just unclip the back of the phone and wash it with soap and warm water. DO NOT get the battery or phone wet! This phone can't have many apps at once, maybe five, depending how big they are. But it has a removable mini SD card, which is very nice. And it works well for Bluetooth, texting, talking, WiFi, and everything you'll need on a phone. The camera is pretty good too. Plus it's inexpensive, not to mention it has triple minutes, a big money-saver! VERY nice phone. I love this phone ! !"
1,This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it!
1,"Love this USB charging unit, its small and allows me to charge my 700 different types of rechargeables. Works great."
1,Absolutely loved it.  It's so clear and for an excellent price. Well done CaLifu
1,"Fast shipping, great product."
0,good item
1,"Your submitted review: Packaging was nice. Screen protector had blue stickers on both sides so it came super clean. Also, it comes with a wipe to clean out any extra dust that may have gotten in. The install was straight forward and simple. Clean phone, case, insert phone and snap in. Put rubber cover on and press into place.  Choose the color you want and press into back. Swapping is easy to. I received this case to review it from New Trent. Happy with it."
1,Cable works fine by using a Live CD (Linux) of the CHIRP software. I did not even try to use the included driver CD. The cable was used to program 10 Retevis H777 radios and a Baofeng UV-5R radio with no problems.
0,"OK,NO DISPLAY OR CHARGER PORT PROTECTION.HARD TO BEAT OTTERBOX DEFENDER."
1,Great durable case
0,My first Knivo completely quit charging and would not turn on.  The on/off button stopped working.  I purchased another on to give it another try.  I will see.  Holding my breath!
1,"Great unit, a little difficult to install so be patient.  Works great and map updates are continual/ongoing at no extra cost. I update maps 3-4 times per year.  It has my recommendation."
1,"This is a great little stand for my iPhone and Apple Watch.  The stand is bamboo and is very light.  Even though it is lightweight, it holds my phone perfectly.  My phone has a protective case on it and it still fits.  The watch loops over this holder and charges well.  The cable comes in from behind the stand and the extra cable stores in the bottom of the holder. There are 4 rubber feet on the bottom that prevent the stand from slipping.  The front of the holder has a small indent in it so that you can still push the home button while the phone is in the holder.  I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
1,Runs out of juice faster than I thought it would
-1,Horrible fit!  Case would constantly fall off.
0,"Received on time,  It fitted in my galaxy perfect, the edges does not stick perfect, I do not know why."
1,Good
0,"I like this case.  It was really cool when it arrived.  Pricey, but this company makes good products.  Unfortunately my case hasn't held up very well.  Threading started coming out a little, then a lot!  It's so bad now that the case really isn't usable.  I purchased this product in February of this year, and it only seems to have lasted a little over 6 months.  Slightly disappointed."
1,GOOD BUY
1,Worked great!
-1,Broke after 2 months or so.
1,very nice item
1,Great light weight bluetooth headphones! It feels cheap but works like a charm!!
1,"Works great, so far it's holding up better than other chargers I've had. I'd definitely recommend this or another braided jacket cable. That alone helps them hold up better"
-1,BOTH CABLES DID NOT WORK PROPERLY. IT DID NOT CHARGE QUICKLY OR PROPERLY AS THE OEM. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT.
1,"I wanted a water resistant because I work for the local school and the raining  season is about to start.  This looks and feels good and is easy to put on.  It also allows wireless charging which is nice because I got the charger free with the phone.  Though I wish the instructions were for this phone,because watching  the instructions for an iPhone 6 for a Samsung note is strange.<br /><br />Edit:Sombody asked about the stylus access so i uploded some pictures."
1,"Works like it should along with a nice design, would buy again."
1,"I've tried a few generic brand lightening cables and they all eventually break.  so far, this one works great out of the box.  I've been using it for about 3 months and have had no problems."
1,Great
-1,"Poor quality as far as the color (black) on the outside part that covers the glass, the color started to erase easily after a week or less using my nail and simple touches to hard sufraces"
1,The quality is not higth.
1,Nice mount for my phone
1,Works great thx
1,Instructions suck.  Need a better selection of screws....it was like a mix and match screw selection.
1,"I bought 10 of these 10 ft. cables because I like to charge two or three devices where I use them when they need it, sometimes in the bedroom. living room and office, and don't want to unplug the cord and drag it with me.  I had problems with the original order in that they quickly began to lose their &#34;staying connectedness&#34;.  What I mean is that the small port would lose the ability to stay in the device, it would fall out if I didn't loop the cord around my hand to release any tension on the plug or it would fall out.  Then I had to start putting something under the plug where it connected to keep it in the right place so the interior part would make the connection and charge.  Finally my tablet just wouldn't charge on these cords, my phone and Kindle would, but not the tablet.  So I called Anker and they said send them back for replacement.  Before I could find them and a box to ship them in Anker had sent me one cable, thinking that's all I was having a problem with.  I re-called them and explained that no, it was all of them and I was still looking for all of them, that I'd only found 7 so far (some had been relegated to a dead electronics coffin somewhere).  Anker said they'd go ahead and replace the other 6 then, and I would ship back the 7.  I had shipped the 7 back by this time, my 7 had crossed their 1 in the mail, and that I was not happy that not only had I had the problem with all the cables, but that they had gotten the replacement shipping wrong also (I had followed both calls up with an email explaining the problem and that it happened with 10, and the order number to show I had originally ordered 10.  I asked for overnight shipping because I was having to make due with one Anker cable and one cheapie Walmart one that I had from the old days and it was very inconvenient.  They not only shipped out the originally asked for 9 additional (adding up to the 10 in the order) but did it Fed Ex Express (it was Friday when I called, nearly at the endof the day, so that was as close as they could get to overnight).  I've waited a couple of weeks to write this review to make sure the new cables stay secure and they do.  I also wanted to point out that Anker provides excellent customer service and, in my opinion, goes above and beyond what any company I've dealt with in the last 20 years will do.  They provide what customer service used to be &#34;in the old days&#34; when companies really wanted the customer to be happy and would go to whatever lengths it took to make that happen.  I would totally recommend them for any of their products, feeling comfortable that the company has the customers best interests at heart and will resolve any issues."
1,I have had no problems with my purchase. I am a very happy customer. Would definitely buy again.
1,"This is a great armband for my son to use his iPhone with. He loves to workout at the gym and take long runs. It fits perfect on his arm and the velcro stayed closed while he was running. Marsboy Armband is also waterproof.<br /><br />It is nicely designed and seems it will hold up very well. I did have another armband for him but it broke within a few uses. He has been using it now for quite a while and it looks great, stays in shape, and is easy to take his phone in and out. It is snug so he does not have to worry about it falling out. He likes this so much better while he works out than a regular waist band or clip. I received this armband complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.  Marsboy Armband"
1,"The case is a little thin, but then we switched from an Otter box so the comparison might not be fair. The colors are vibrant and the product quality is good. I'd buy it again, and recommend to a friend."
1,Charges fast!  I can stream music and use a map program and still get my phone charged.
1,Thanks.
1,"I bought this for the reviews and they are accurate. It is a sturdy cable, thicker than the apple that came with my phone. The connectors look like they will last a while."
1,Really nice
1,"This keyboard works better than expected. There is no lag in typing and entry on screen. Connects just perfectly. And the best part is the amazing low price!! Don't waste your money on other keyboards that are more expensive, just get this one.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this is so inexpensive, but it rocks!<br /><br />I must say, I really love using this keyboard. I found it to be easy to use, accurate, lightweight, and the battery life even lasts pretty long."
1,"Rugged case and comfortable to hold. For the price, you may not find anything better. Its well put together and feels sturdy."
1,"I live in the upper Northeast and started looking at solar chargers last winter, after we had an ice storm that knocked out power for almost a week!"
1,Very good and save place
1,"Works well, replaced my previous device which was discount from AT&T and it lasted about 1.5 years.  When it indicates charged...take it off the charger because you may warp the battery and damage the charging circuit in the router."
-1,The sticker is pelling off. The cover the back was right but the front of it was cama. Was not happy.
-1,Nice throw away item.
1,First set had a hard time staying charged but they were awesome and sent a replacement.  Things are working fine now.
1,"My previous case started cracking after a year and a half of use.  I ordered this one as a replacement until I eventually upgrade to a new device.  I was very pleased to receive my order a couple of business days later.  The estimated arrival window hadn't even started.  Upon opening the package I was pleased once again.  It came with a new screen protector, and also a handy stylus.  Only having one issue with the product, and it is more due to me not having my toolbox with me.  I can get 3 or 4 corners to fully come up over the edge.  One though, is trying to roll up and not pop out.  Once I go to the office tomorrow, I should be able to fix that.  Just needs a slight pry from a tiny flat head.  Overall, I am impressed with the quality, price, and shipping time.  Exceeding my expectations.  Keep up the good work."
1,so pretty and reeky has protected my phone from cracking (after dropping it in the parking lot!)
0,It's not certified.
-1,"Does the job, quality is okay"
-1,"I've had the retractable charger for about 2 weeks, the retractable cord is already jammed.  I do not recommend this product."
0,"I liked it at first, but after two weeks or so, the water started disappearing, I don't know how because I can't find any leaks. But when the water comes out, the glitter doesn't move."
0,The rubber stretches and does stay put the black rubbed off and is turning white
1,Great case and cool color too.
1,Very happy with how easy it was to install.  I had one spot thought it would stay after letting it sit for a couple days then it went away very happy with this purchase.
-1,"It fit perfectly -- Looks good too. But after 3 months the edge just cracks off, in each corner in big chunks. Customer service was non-responsive."
1,It's alright
1,"Good price and good case.  Clip rotates, has a stand for displaying the phone horiaontally."
1,"So I don't know about you, but every now and then I love a nice long bubble bath. I've got my nice scents, light low and comfortable but the music is missing! I don't like taking my phone in the bathroom because of the moisture in the air and i like switching songs, but don't want to get my phone wet. This little device has solved all my problems! It's amazing how much quality sound comes from this little speaker. First, it comes in a hard plasic container so it doesn't move around or get damaged It holds a charge very well I can use it for a week and still have great strong sound. the ONLY thing i'd have a negative thing about ( which is NOT the sellers fault) is just that the suction cup doesn't stay... mainly because my shower walls are slightly dimpled so my walls do not provide the adequate surface... BUT i have tested on flat, clean glass and it stays pretty strong! I can change my music without touching my phone. I can leave my phone in my room and not disturb the connection :) I LOVE it!!<br /><br /> I was able to review this item at a discount for my completely honest, unbiased review!"
1,Real handy
-1,doesn't have good touch.
1,Such a pretty phone cover
1,Excellent Cell phone charger
1,"Very, very nice case/protector.  Usually I find myself having something wrong.  This one does NOT seem cheaply made at all.  Thank you"
1,"For under $10 you really can't go wrong. The Note 5 is just to slippery to use without a case, and having had Cruzerlite cases for almost every phone I've had I purchased another one. It fits the Note 5 very well, and does not block any of the ports. Also, it allows wireless charging with my Tylt charger. Great case, no complaints."
1,Super fast ! Excellent product
-1,"Terrible. Stopped working, no longer charging, after 2 months. Don't waste your money."
1,"Built materials is excellent, great 170 wide angle image.<br />Just my personal opinion,  day videos are very good. Night vision is OK, same or closed night quality as Dome G90s. G1w has a brighter night video but less detail than this R1 Pro (up to 1080 only)."
0,"After two years of having this case, it will start to fail of you. But regardless of everything it is still a case and it covers the phone."
1,"This is just what I was looking for to use in my charging valet. Very nice quality, works great and some of the most Apple-like packaging I have seen"
1,Exactly what I needed. Came as promised.
0,cute
1,"This is by far one of the better case I've purchased for the Nexus 5. I've tried a handful of other ones. Simple enough to not be bulky, and protective enough that it won't scratch up the base and has a bit of extra length over the screen that it protect the screen also if you lay it screen down."
1,One of the coolest things ever for your car perfect wish I would've known about this sooner
1,"Very nice cable. It's very sturdy, not brittle like the other brand's i've had in the past."
-1,"Im sure its a good item, but it does not look good on the 6 edge. The sides are open and the borders catch a lot of dirt. Not so good for this phone."
-1,The size is not correct since it not cover the display 100%. It seems it has not been cut properly.
1,"works as advertised.  small, well-built.  sometimes i have trouble charging in the second port but if i wiggle it around it works ..the problem might be my car's cigarette lighter. overall, i am very happy though...especially for the price."
1,Awesome case
-1,Item broke already
1,I love all Piel Frama products.  This is a great sleeve.
1,Excellent and very easy to setup and use.
1,This ninja kitten is sooo cute. He looks just like my sister's new kitten which makes him even cuter in my eyes. The phone jack is tiny (a lot smaller than what the picture make it seem) but that adds to the cuteness factor. It is not bulky and does not get caught on anything due to its small size.
1,Fast Shipping.  Great product.
1,"Looks nice, perfect size, good to have all other extras."
1,Can't give this a 5 star since I screwed up installing this.  It would have worked had I not cut the connection for the touchscreen.  I will have to purchase a new screen and start over. I think installation was quite easy but it would have helped having instructions to guide me through.
1,"Great speakers for the price and the quality!!!  I bought this as a gift for someone who really appreciates some good hard BASS.  I did some research online on portable/bluetooth/wireless speakers, comparing different reviews and ratings online, and in the end it came down to three speakers rated for great bass/sub performance.  Of the three (one of them was the SONY SRS-X5), I decided to go with the Jabra.  I based this decision on three things, price, durability, and aesthetics.  The Jabra SOLEMATE is a bit under $100 including shipping for Amazon Prime members, unlike its other competitor speakers with quality sub performance.  Furthermore, the thick soles of the speaker really caught my attention.  Most electronic products on the market usually have some form of weak little rubber glued on each corner at the bottom.  However, the Jabra SOLEMATE has this cool looking sole great for absorbing any impact for setting the speakers down.  Did I mention that it looks awesome?  Oh yes, and back to the Original decision factor, the bass.  Oh wow the bass.  The quality of sound that comes out of this little thing is still mind blowing.  The volume, clarity, and BASS!!!! just all around WOWmazing!!!  After testing them out and using it for a little under a week, I am already looking into buying another one for myself."
1,Was easy to to put on and came in fast!
1,Works exactly as described!  Perfect for my new charging station!
1,"Love it - using it to charge 4 iPads, 1 iPhone, and 1 micro-usb device (Android phone, Harmony remote. bluetooth speaker, etc.); a little cable management is necessary (http://www.cloopband.com/ for me) but my 3, 6, and 7 year olds work with it very well;"
1,"Love it.  It's not slippery so I don't worry it's going to slip off and hit the floor. Protects the phone well, and I appreciate the screen guard being included.  Easy to put on and take off.  BONUS:  in bright light it's sparkly; otherwise looks like flat blue.  Color is true to picture."
1,I know a lot of people who purchased from this seller so I thought to give them a try. I received a discount on my order for a fair review and this charger works really well. I will be purchasing more soon as backups since my puppy like to chew on my cords lol.
1,So reasonably priced and is protecting my phone better than a screen protector I paid four time more for!
1,I am very much impressed with the quality of this phone holder. It is a simple but very ingenious holder in my opinion. I did receive it free of charge to test it and share my honest opinion. Really easy to use you simple stick the holder in the vent of your a/c air in the car and if you have a plastic cover on your phone you put the round or larger metal plate they sent with it between the phone and the cover so the magenta will work.The holder is rubberized so it won't scratch your phone . I took a picture of the phone with the magnet inside my plastic cover to show how strong it is. I am very happy with this product and I do recommend it.
1,As good or as bad as the original Otter.<br />They tend to brake in the belt clip and the hlster clip after a while.
1,I received a discount on my order for a fair review
1,Great deal
-1,Seems as good as stock
0,I like it
-1,"This would be a 4 out 5 star review, but......<br /><br />I've had my UP24 for about 6 months and it's been great until 4 days ago when it stopped working altogether.  I go back on here (where I bought it) and found that I'm not alone.  How can Jawbone make an activity tracker that dies within 6 months of use and charge people $100?  It's got a lot of cool features (the sleep monitoring is the best of the bunch), but no amount of features will overcome durability.  I don't care what it can do if it's broken and I can't use it.  I never even wore it in the shower even though they say you can.  I never submerged it.  I never twisted more than what I needed to put it on my wrist.<br /><br />There's nothing that turns me off from a product like a lack of durability with normal use.  If Jawbone doesn't do something to make me whole, they've lost a customer for life.  Maybe I'll come back when I hear overwhelming positive reviews about the durability and reliability of their products, but that won't happen for a while the way all the reviews of their new products are going.<br /><br />This sucks.  I really liked it when it worked...."
1,Good quality at a fair price.
0,Good!
1,Great!
-1,Ok but not as thick as I thought
1,My husband is happy now that his blue tooth fits right.  So I am happy.
1,"It's a great investment but, they should have 2 cloths since there is 2 screens in the package."
1,"Unlike some cases I've had in the past, it seems to not get dirty very easily and does not seem to trap a lot of unwanted dust. It is rather hard to get it on and off sometimes for cleaning."
0,"I really like this case, it's very cute and fun but the only thing wrong with it is that THE TAIL IS FALLING OFF! Otherwise it's a very nice case for laying around the house and showing off :)"
0,"Good:<br />* It handles a iPhone 6+ with a a Speck case<br />Not so good:<br />* it's a snug fit so I have to push/pull the phone. I'd hoped it'd have loosened up by now (2months).<br />* The clasp isn't very tight, so the holster sometimes comes off when I sit down or bend some certain way.  The heftiness of the 6+ exacerbates the problem.  Also when I pull the phone out (up) sometimes the holster comes with it.  Simply put: the clasp needs to be tighter.<br /><br />For years now the most tiresome part of getting a new phone is finding a case and shell combo that works.  Too often I just tire of looking and settle for something that I can suffer with.  Such is the case here."
-1,Don't take a chance on this cheap piece of crap. Just fork over $50 for a microsoft charger. This thing lasted a few days before cutting out completely and is not worth the $10 its priced at.
-1,"Screen protector is very sticky and I can't use volume, or power buttons."
1,Dose what it supposed to do holes  my watch and phone so they can charge
1,Great piece of gear. It is sleek and very well built. I managed to fully charge my Macbook 2015 with this thing. Impressive!
1,"Good product, hard to open access panels to plug charger and earplug."
1,"excelent product, this case is very nice"
1,great
1,Got this today and it batter thin I thought it would be fits on my arms i would recommend everyone to buy This for themselves<br />I got this product for a review and it was worth it
1,Very nicely constructed simple case. Needed a smaller case to go along with my heavy duty hard sided case that holds all mounts. This will hold the essentials for a quick grab and go. using Hero 3 black edition with this case.
1,Fast Delivery good product
0,"Case fits Xperia Z3 (t-mobile version). Provides great protection with the metal siding. My only complaints are that cell signal drops 1-2 bars with the case, phone becomes quite heavy, USB case cover and phone charge port are a bit of a struggle to work with, and case says &#34;Love Mei&#34; (can see a mile away)."
1,Works great for charging my I POD.
1,perfect fit for the 94 accord 4cyl.
0,This item did not work completely. I am not entirely sure if it was the product or the phone had been damaged beyond repair. Item was shipped on time and came in excellent condition.
0,product as expected. .
1,Love these. Take great pics without lugging a camera!
1,Purchased this to replace the factory charger that was misplaced. Works great!
1,Works just like its supposed to.
1,Good price and helps out well.
1,"I have owned Samsung smartphones in the past as well, as previous LG G2 and now the G4, which I have had for one month.  Whenever I read a review about this phone, I generally hear such &#34;CONS&#34; about the button position and the build quality. Just so you know, I appreciate both those features a great deal. First, the buttons, I hardly, if ever, use the buttons. I set the volume and forget it, what I don't like about phones with buttons on the top or side is that when you grab your phone or fish it out of your pocket, you can accidently send the caller to voice mail, disconnect them or decrease or increase the volume requiring you to phone fiddle, call back the caller or go to voice mail if they leave a message... a hassle. If I am at my desk and I get a call, I set my G4 to answer when I pick it up and say &#34;Hello&#34; no buttons to push... CONVENIENT.  sECOND. &#34;THE BUILD QUALITY AND APPEARANCE&#34;  Metal components on a phone adds to the weight when compared to plastic, metal can be dented and metal reduces the sensitivity of the phones receiver because it can block weak signals from the cell tower. As far as &#34;Appearance&#34; ... what the heck, most people are going to put a case on it anyhow.  If you like the touch features on your phone then you should know that the G4 can do everything by screen touch alone, even the home button is virtual and you can move it and the others around for your convenience and operating comfort.  Is it the fastest phone? No it is not. Is there any phone that is twice as fast? No there is not and even if there was what would it get you?  Typically, a G4 can open an app in one second, if there was a phone twice as fast then it could open an app in 1/2 second. What i9s that 1/2 second worth to you?  Battery Life for texting and calling can easily last the full day. Turning on Bluetooth, NFC, GPS, WiFi, full screen brightness and Hotspot will surely kill your battery in  3 hours but you can quickly replace it in 30 seconds and go on.for another 3 hours and by then your reserve can be ready again.  Tap the screen anywhere twice and the phone wakes up, in camera mode tap the screen anywhere it it snaps a picture.  In my estimation the lack of side buttons is a big convenience except my girlfriend is still disconnecting me when answering her S4 !  OK... It doesn't have a finger print reader but there are four other types of phone Locking methods such as, pin code, knock code, face recognition and voice recognition. As I said, when my phone is asleep... all I have to do is pick it up and say Hello, this feature can be turned off so that you do have to press the screen button to answer.  Lastly, right here on Amazon for the price of just $8.00 you can order a G4 Wireless charging receiver for your phone and install it in a under 5 minutes and that can be coupled to a regular or &#34;Fast Charger&#34; that the G4 supports."
1,I am extremely pleased with the product.  A dependable phone!
1,Love this case! I have had it for about 2 months and it is working great!
1,Very cute! Love it!
1,"Got this for travel and it worked very well. Was able to charge 2 devices without problem,and the 2A port does charge devices quickly."
0,I received this case On time and in new condition But it was the wrong color. The packing slip inside the package was for someone with a different name in a different state.    It seems to be a pretty durable case. I am a little disappointed that I ordered black and got sent mint green.  This was for my husbands phone because he keeps having problems with cases but he won't use this since it's mint green.   It seems to be a pretty durable case none the less.  The plastic back has me concerned that after a drop or two it would break.  It also has rubber on the top and bottom for a little extra durability. It fits around the phone like a sleeve so I would definitely be sure to get some tempered glass so your screen doesn't crack if dropped.  I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
1,"It's a film protector. I don't see it but I guess that means its doing its job, no scratches!"
1,Great product thanks very well build quality
-1,"Pretty cheap, phone clamp loosens up and turns easy."
-1,"buy 2 , one would run a few weeks the wifi and then stopped when I wanted to make a claim had already spent time replacement"
-1,This is second purchase because of the unit breaks easily
1,"Fits great, looks sharp."
1,"It's pretty cool, very nice, love it."
0,"I bought this case for my daughter's phone. She loves it, but the fit is not as snug as I would have liked."
-1,This is not a great quality case. Looks really  cheap. .I guess you get what you pay for. Disappointed
-1,Does not work with a larger Otter Box case on an iPhone 6. But the Amazon Basics car charger I bought at the same time does work. Seems like a real lack of thought from the designers.
-1,Your product sucks!!!!!
1,"This case is intense! For someone like me who drops their phone on a regular basis this is a must have! I would say that this case is tougher than an Otterbox and a lot cheaper too! If you want to protect your phone without breaking the bank, be sure to grab one of these cases. The belt clip is also a great addition for people who are used to carrying their phones that way. I recommend this case to anyone! This product was given to me at a discount in exchange for an accurate and honest review!<br /><br />-H"
1,My Dad liked his gift
1,Was everything I needed. Perfect item and price was outstanding
1,Granddaughter loves her case
1,"Love The New Headphones , They Are Really Loud And Fashonable 😍😍"
-1,Not what I expected
-1,"Contact issue. It won't charge, as the battery symbol in the display flicking, until I press it hard."
1,I love the thickness of the wire and the length!
1,Fast delivery and great product. Thanks
1,"amazing cell phone protector, we don't understand the science, but it totally protects the screen,  We put these phone guards on with the eCo-covers [[ASIN:B011324P18 The BPA-Free iPhone 6 eCo-cover includes IPG Invisible Phone Guard for free!]],  and no longer have to worry about breaking our phones or screens."
1,"Amazon's products never let me down, the lightning to USB product are great prices and work just like Apple products.  Great job Amazon!"
-1,Worked for 3 days then broke. Very dissatisfied.
1,works perfectly!
1,"Zerolemon sent this item to test and review. This USB charger is by far one of the best I've seen on the market. It will charge using all three ports without any problems. I own a Galaxy Note 4, iPhone 6 Plus, and a Nexus 6. I put the charger in for all three of them and the results are as follows:<br /><br />2.1 amp port<br />Note 4<br />0%-100% - 3.5 hr<br />0%-50% - 1.3hr<br />50%-100% - 1.5hr<br /><br />iPhone 6 plus<br />0%-100% - 4.0hr &#60;-- Smaller batter but took forever even on the 2.1 amp port<br />0%-50%  - 1.5hr<br />50%-100% - 1.8 hr<br /><br />Nexus 6 &#60;-- Gave same results as the Note 4 due to similar size battery.<br />0%-100% - 3.5 hr<br />0%-50% - 1.5hr<br />50%-100% - 1.7hr<br /><br />I didn't test the other amp ports as they would've taken forever to charge. But I did notice one thing, on the 1.0 amp port, none of the phones were losing percentage as sometimes the case happens with cheap car chargers that offer multiple ports but can only charge through one port at a time due to bad manufacturing or design. I had all three plugged in with full brightness, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluethooth on with Google Maps navigation on and the 2 phones, Note 4 and Nexus 6, plugged into the 2.1 amp and 2.0 amp port respectively, were slowly gaining battery, iPhone 6 Plus on the 1.0 amp port was not gaining any battery for a long time but at the same time didn't lose any battery.<br /><br />Yes the 2.1 amp is for the iPad but all phones charged on it faster then the 2.0 amp port. I plugged in the latest iPad (Early 2015 Model) and with heavy usage on the 2.1 amp port I saw battery decreasing slowly even though it was plugged in. I didn't get a time for the iPad because it would've taken forever. With light usage the battery will charge slowly about 1% every two to three minutes.<br /><br />Honestly if its at all possible just proved 3 ports with 2.1 amps, this would create much ease for any other passenger in the car trying to get a quick charge on their phone."
-1,Does not hold gps or cell phone and cell phone is a motorola turbo pretty thick phone.
1,I loved the colors and designs.
-1,Love the durability and color. The biggest issue is I can't get the case to close securely around the entire tablet. It's only on one side. It seems like the silicone is too big. I'll have to look for another product.
1,"Looks stylish, does the job, sits anywhere, and does not fall off easily (coz it sits!). It also has a sticky pad to its bottom, which adds to the stability of this phone mount. Love it.<br /><br />Bought similar product in different design before (alike almost all products out there), which relies on a suction pad on one end to STAND itself, and hold phone on the other end like an arm. This creates a lever and makes it too easy to un-mount itself from wherever it should stand. Also I'm not a big fan of magnetic mounts for 1. I don't want to have to add something to my phone in order to mount it, and 2. I don't feel safe to put electronic products next to magnets.<br /><br />Drawbacks: 1. This thing would sometimes hold down buttons on the side of my phone, in my case the volume down button, so it would silence my phone. This can be simply avoided by moving the phone a bit. 2. This thing fits so well in the car with or without my phone mounted, in a way that I found quite often myself forgetting about taking the phone off with me when leaving the car. Why couldn't it remind me my phone's still in the car? Bad boy!<br /><br />All in all, highly recommend this phone mount."
-1,"I bought 2 pairs one for me and the other for my wife.  She didn't like them,  i gave it a shot.  The music part of it works well, good base. But the voice calls part was bad. The microphone had a problem picking up my voice,  i had to almost scream.  One side of the ear peace stopped working so i ended up shelving the unit and now took my wife's.  Lets see how long those work."
1,This case is solid. I have no doubt my phone will be protected from being dropped between this and a glass screen protector. It fits the phone incredibly well and covers no important areas and the buttons are still accessible. A nice new phone case of high quality. The kickstand is also a nice little feature for me using my phone for videos. I received this item for free for a honest review. This is very excellent quality.
-1,"Over stretched rubber, plastic piece doesn't fully click, rubber tab don't stay in, hard to type on click screen"
1,"It is light, pretty and durable"
1,Thank you!!! :-D
1,"I saw more than a dozen people at Great America with this waterproof case, and had to have it! This was perfect foe Hurricane Harbor !"
1,Product as described.
1,Good!!
1,just as explained
0,"The device not work all that well (but, it does work),volume of the headset is a bit low, and while talking i have to speak very loudly to broadcast a legible tone for the recipient to interpret."
1,Works great and I don't have to be concerned about having a new phone!
1,The corners don't stick
1,"its great case, Sucks to take on and off to replace the battery, but well worth it,"
1,Bought for my husband and he loves this phone cover.
-1,"Awful, Awful, Awful.  Do not buy.  We have had 3 now and all of them broke or stopped working in very short time."
1,Cool product! All work. Good to have around
1,Big tough cable that won't fray! Well worth the price.
-1,This selfie stick was really weak kept turning my iphone 6 around couldn't return it because past the date I brought it so now I have tapped it. and ducktape still wont hold my phone steady!
1,Great seller. Fast delivery. Product as described. Thank you!
-1,Was very cheap and didn't look like the picture. Was literally a patterned sticker on a white plastic case.
1,"Love this wallet - fits my iPhone 6 in OtterBox Defender case. With my phone, I can't overstuff with coins or other things but the phone fits -- its snug but doesn't seem to pull the zipper when closed. Very attractive look.  I bought the blue and it is more navy than the picture in the description shows.  But the stitching and zipper are sturdy - time will tell since I just bought it."
1,Add a Moment wide angle lens and a Monfroto pan head and it makes a great panorama with 8 shots around that fits in your pocket.
-1,As soon as they start getting hot outside good thing would fall off my dashboard
1,6 days of battery life with my Note 4. Need I say more?
1,I love this phone. It is a lot more than I expected in a cell phone. I would recommend it to  anyone that is looking for an excellent cell phone. The battery life if a little on the short side is the only complaint I have.
0,it takes a while to get charged but once its charged and can charge 2 iphones conveniently.
0,Great for a stand not the best to protect the phone.
1,I love this phone! i bought this a while back and I still have it. This phone case is very durable just like the headphones and the charger.
-1,"Poor construction, the clear piece separated from the side molding from everyday use.  The case lasted me a couple of months at most.  Will not recommend to purchase this case."
0,It's ok not as nice as the black one I purchased
1,Durable
1,This is such a fun little device. It fits my giant LG G4 with a pretty bulky case easily and with room to spare. I love the design of the stick. It folds down to about 5.3 inches so it's portable enough to toss in my purse or keep in the car for those unexpected photo ops.<br />The stainless steel arm extends easily and had no problem supporting the weight of my phone. It feels strong and durable and seems like it will last a long time.
1,works exactly as advertised.
1,Very nice i iwll buy it again.
-1,"mistake in communications, I asked for a case for the LG 3 - got the case for the LG2 - very small difference, but it did not fit."
1,I was somewhat unsure about ordering another micro usb cable on the internet but my other one stopped charging. I was happy to find out that is is doing great job and it isn't very short. I will definitely look for this company to purchase mine again.
1,Need more things to work with Alexa.
1,I love it and very happy with my product that I got
1,Bought a second because I liked the sleek appearance.
1,"content OK, shipment OK, I'd recommend. Thx"
-1,didnt work much better than my old battery.... should have just got a new phone
1,"Worked fine, but had some non-adhesion to the edges, but overall its a great product."
1,"Very practical and easy to install. Great value and does the job. Will allow one a wider range of exposure too, not to mention greater clarity when shooting those panorama views. Yes, I would highly recommend this product."
1,Love my case.
-1,I bought two of these chargers and both craped out in less than 2 months. why is it so hard to get good chargers? I a waiting  for an authorization to return them. I want a full refund at this point
1,the phone is nearly perfect!
1,still learning everything it can and cant do
-1,"This charger is a joke. It only holds the phone charge where it is but does not charge the phone up on either my phone or my wife's phone. Tried multiple outlets in 2 cars without better results. Tried the other charger i own and it charges my phone just fine. If I wanted a phone battery holder this would be great,  but no one actually wants that."
1,"I ordered the UP3 by Jawbone because I was curious as to my activity level during the day and interested in its sleep tracking abilities.  I have had the UP3 band for several weeks now and am very happy with my purchase.  It is so easy to use with the app installed on my phone that even my 5 year old likes to look at it to see if I am meeting me goals.  The sleep mode is a great feature of this product.  It is interesting to look at your nighttime sleep log and see how positive changes in sleep behavior impact my levels of light, deep and REM sleep.  Overall, I really enjoy my UP3 band."
1,"Excellent piece of hardware - I am so impressed with the capabilities that the HooToo has file sharing, movie watching, etc.  I am using this as a bridge for my wireless at home and the signal strength and throughput is awesome!"
1,Favorite case I have used .Wish they made one for my new phone .
0,My music always has a ton of static no matter where I am or what station I'm using. Also the buttons are really flimsy. I can no longer click on the &#34;next&#34; or &#34;previous&#34; song buttons because they are stuck and end up turning off my iPod if I push down too hard. I've only had the thing for a few months.
1,Excellent product
-1,"this is silicone and not leather,  don't be confused.  Everything sticks to this,  lint,  money,  etc.  So you pull it out of your pocket and sometimes even the pocket lining comes out.  If you want it to be non-slip,  go for it."
-1,Slow charge.
1,Love It got 2 of them and going to get 4 more for son and grand kids.
1,This is the only cell phone that I will use. I've tried the smart phone and took it back and said make my old phone work again. The main reason that I bought this one was that I left my old one in my pants and washed it. Rice in a bag didn't bring it back.
1,Product arrived promptly and in great shape.  Easy to install and does a good job protecting my screen.  Thanks!
1,This works great for a low phone battery.  I highly recommend this product.
1,"We bought this for our cross-country trip with our 4-year-old this summer. It worked wonderfully! She figured out the controls relatively quickly (which I didn't expect) so she was able to pause it, etc. It won't continue play when the car is shut down (at least in our car it didn't) which gave me some peace of mind that it wouldn't accidentally be left on during a break and help drain the car battery. Out daughter wasn't able to change out discs herself though, because of the limited angle that the lid opens to allow the removal of discs. Older kids might be able to, and it wasn't really a problem for the passenger adult to reach behind and switch discs when needed.<br /><br />When we first received it, there was a rattling sound whenever the monitor was moved (like maybe a screw was loose and caught in the casing), which caused me some concern, but we haven't had any issues with it. It still works and we haven't had any problems with damage to discs. Like I said, this was a cross-country trip so it was used for probably 20+ hours in a matter of three weeks and there wasn't any problem with it shutting down or not working.<br /><br />The included strap for attaching it to a headrest didn't work really well for our car, but with an additional elastic band we were able to secure it well."
1,It works great. I needed one for downstairs or for the car.  No more dragging the original cord around.
1,Excellent product. Holds my Galaxy Note 4 without a problem.
1,"Looks great on our end table. It is extremely easy to set up, more useful to hang up the watch."
1,Delivered in condition as expected.
1,Fast shipping!! Loved it
1,i hav e a i phone 5 s and use a lifeproof nuude i dropped my phone in johnsons pond in coventry ri .it dropped it in 8 feet of fresh water for about 3.0 hours until we found it. we face timed it because the water was black and it was dark out . we found it and it works perfectly.also had it replaced for free 2 times because i sat on it and the edges had gotten distorted and they replaced it for free.t<br />  thank you life proof you are worth every penny.my neighbors are getting them now that they saw it works<br />philip casacalenda<br />coventry ri
1,"As a family of four with smartphones, tablets, kindles, etc we were constantly fighting over the chargers in the living room, or we'd secretly hide a charger or two in the bedroom to keep the kids from swiping them.  Then I got one of these, plugged in a couple of [[ASIN:B00VUNHJCS multi-headed charge cables]] and that all of that stopped.  Not only is there (almost) always a free plug, but everything stays put now since it's tucked away inside a [[ASIN:B0017K8W5W Digipower SAM-G100-CH charger organizer]].<br /><br />I'm tempted to put one of these at my desk at work since people are always looking for power there. Seems like a great way to meet your coworkers and have them feel slightly indebted to you..."
1,Perfect! My tablet is alive again!
0,iPhone 6+ does not fit well inside
1,"perfect for an ID and credit card, with room for cash while securing your cell phone stylishly."
1,Perfect fit and just the right amount of minimal protection that I wanted.
1,Great product
-1,I love it.....just what I wanted!
0,"The gold one is beautiful but after a while, the gold just peels! Disappointed."
-1,The microphone worked and the left earbud but the right one didn't on all 3. Don't waste the money buy better ones
1,"Thin, easy to install, fits PERFECTLY, and looks GREAT!  Like many iPhone users...I've tried many cases.  This is the new gold standard for me.  Not intended to withstand crazy abuse or for the user who regularly drops his/her phone.  But for the 90% of us who carefully handle our phone....this one works great."
1,Awesome product
1,Just what I wanted. Very prompt in sending it.
-1,"Though the magnet works great, the CD mount version squeaks like a rabid mouse on amphetamines, even on smooth roads.<br />Seems secure in CD socket, but wiggles up and down enough to squeak constantly"
1,fit perfectly & very sturdy...i drop my phone a lot & no cracks
1,Very nice bulletproof case. Very sturdy like it a lot.
0,"On the plus side, the battery arrived more than a week ahead of the estimated delivery date, and it was identical to the original.<br />In fact it appeared to be an actual Apple part.<br />The included tools are absolutely necessary for the replacement.<br />There are no instructions included, but here are several YouTube videos that show the entire replacement process.<br />It only took 5 minutes beginning to end.<br />A lighted magnifier and tweezers are highly recommended as the screws are very small.<br /><br />I can only give 3 stars because the battery appears to be used.  Visually it was in mint condition, but diagnostics showed a 600+ cycle count.<br />That doesn't qualify as new to me.<br />Other reviews stated the same thing, batteries showing significant cycle counts.<br />For the price, with the tools included, as long as the battery holds up for a while, it seems like a reasonable deal.<br />It's just misleading to call it &#34;new&#34;.<br />The tools probably only cost a couple dollars to make, but they are indispensable."
1,"I like this item well enough. For the price it is decent, but it's not the most sturdy thing ever. It's a really flexible plastic. At least it doesn't add extra &#34;bulk&#34; to my phone though!"
1,Adorable way to decorate and protect your phone.
1,"gift for grandson, he loves it"
1,"Seller Contacted me twice and offered to assist me in any way. The cover would not stayed closed and looked very inexpensive on the expensive watch! I gave them 4 stars as they were willing to assist me in any way, but the product I would not buy again."
1,Good Morning. you can tell me if the radio brings support for putting the vehicle? (Nissan versa 2009)
1,Bought this for my mother-in-law as a replacement battery to her T-Mobile MyTouch Q. It worked perfectly and the phone isn't dying in ten seconds anymore
1,Great product I love it but after an hour of using it my power bank stopped working I would for it to work again.
1,Thank you! Just as described but design is already rubbing off. quick shipping!
1,"Almost made it the 2yrs life of the phone's contract, but definitely not intended for someone who occasionally drops their phone. 2 times and my phone's screen is done. Very convenient keeping the basic cards & I'D attached with your phone. Next upgrade, though, I'm sticking with Otterbox & a separate wallet."
1,I have no complaints.
1,Excellent product and great customer service!!!  I will order nothing but these from now on!
1,Works very well.
1,Seem to work really good with iphone 5's and 6's. Seem to be very well built.
1,"This device is worth every penny. In two months we were extremely informed instead of in the dark. Super accurate, reliable and awesome. he features are fun to work with and the device never let us down. Until we lost it. Darn."
1,Excited!
1,Kids loved it!  Great product!
1,It fit well.
-1,"after few uses, the thing that holds the phone doesn't do its job anymore. It got lose!"
1,Looks nice and authentic. Plus it works really good. I'm satisfied as it is.
1,I love this phone.  I have had it for almost a year and it works fabulously.  There have been no major problems.  Some time the camera loses focus during video.  But it is a great phone for the price.
1,"Arrived on time, seems to be working just fine! Thanks"
1,Worth the buy!
-1,Was to big for my phone..was a waste.... 😾
1,"Haven't tested it's protection capacity. But I hope I don't need to find out. I imagine that to be a spectacular explosion.  it looks to be of good quality, and it was a fair price. So kudos."
1,Great little radio.
-1,Piece of junk. Lasted 3 months. Motorola should be embarrassed to put out such a piece of junk.
0,"Made of good material and installed easily, but I didn't read that manufacturer made it purposely smaller to deal with phone screen's rounded edge.  This has the effect of creating a cosmetically unpleasant hard edge all around the screen.  May have to go with film instead. :-("
1,"While the whole case is a little bulky, especially when it is in its clip-on holder, it is really perfect for me and this phone. I like the feel of the rubber on the sides and back, it is really non-slip. I like the edges reach over and create a lip on the front of the phone without losing any of the screen viewing area. And I use the belt clip holder everyday to carry my phone around. It is so much easier than fishing in my pocket for it. It does have a handy clip on the back of the phone case so you can prop the phone up, but I don't use that. Not having it might make the case just a little less bulky."
1,Simply the best!
-1,Awful. Never even put it on my phone.
1,Brought an old unit back to life.
1,Heavy duty cable that works with my iPhone 5s. Will buy again.
1,Great little charger with lots of power.  This charger works perfectly and charges my LG G3 very quickly right to a full charge.
1,Serves purpose :)
1,"Excellent product, wouldn't use my cell without it!"
-1,"FAKE!!! Comes in a Samsung official box, but IS NOT Samsung! Absolute knock-off fake. Do NOT buy!"
1,Exactly what I was wanting!! I Love It!
1,"Improved my internet service, we went from no bars to 4 bars with this antenna."
1,Just got it in this morning and installed it so far so good my s4 if charging right again and it was simple and quick to install and it arrived right on time
1,Great charger for my LG G4 from the trusted brand Anker . I bought it as my workplace charger and it serves the purpose well. Green LED indicates Quick Charge while the blue indicates normal charging. I only wish the prongs would collapse into the body and gave the unit smaller footprint.
1,i love it
1,its pretty good iphone 4. it runs a little slow but i found out thats how iphones work
1,Great product.
1,Lifeproof has always been an upstanding brand. I bought this for my Galaxy S4 and wasn't disappointed at all. I did have to contact Lifeproof due to the hinged charging port protector on the bottom breaking off. Their customer service was excellent with helping me and telling me what I need to send them to get my product replaced. I sent them the information they required and they shipped me a brand new case! I've had no issues at all with the new case or the hinged charging port protector. I would definitely purchase another Lifeproof case if I need one simply because they stand behind their product and take care of their customers.
1,Looks like a great product. Very please
-1,Nothing but paper material
1,"Fits the phone perfectly and has done it's job so far.<br />Have trouble getting the case off, but I don't need to do that often so it isn't a true issue."
0,I bought this cases because I hate taking my case off to put it inside. I use a basic drop protection case that is smaller than an otterbox. I have an iPhone 6 and its snug. I can't imagine trying to squeeze one of those otterbox ones in this thing. It's a low quality armband. Don't expect much.
1,Great way ago carry my garage door opener too.
1,"I originally ordered this because my partner had used it in his car and it worked very well for the iPhone 6. When I originally purchased it, the product fell apart after just a few uses and the mechanism that goes into the vent was very loose. I was really disappointed and decided to contact Koomus customer service about the issue. AMAZING! They responded within minutes via email letting me know they would be sending a replacement out. I received the replacement a few days later and it works very well, just as I hoped it would. I believe the first one I ordered was just a manufacturer's defect.<br /><br />It fits snug into the vent, holds the phone securely and it's even easy to swivel while in place. Overall great product and amazing customer service."
1,"Great case, great price!"
1,"Wish the entire case had the design, not just the back."
1,"First, I will say if you are on the fence about ordering this case - order it. It is a great value for the money. Is it identical to the Lifeproof case? No. Is it a great alternative for a third of the price? Absolutely.  I installed this case 30 minutes ago, so if using it in the real world necessitates an update I will. Install was fairly simple. I did have to reinstall 3 times to achieve a &#34;clean&#34; install (with only one minuscule dust particle - I'm gonna go with it), but in my opinion that's not unusual for this type of case. One note - the ringer switch needs to slide into the toggle/switch on the case. If you look at the inside of the case before you slide your phone in this will make sense. I tested the case with three chargers. Both the authentic Apple cable and the Anker cable fit, but the Amazon Basics cable did not fit the port on this case. Touch ID seems to be responsive through the case. Although you can tell that you have a thicker screen protector between you and your touch screen (especially at the left and right edges close to the rail) the screen is still plenty responsive. No issues there. For headphones the adapter has metal threads and the case has plastic threads. I am concerned this may be an issue in the long term. The volume and power buttons are a little bit on the firm side, but still acceptable. I noticed that the material for the Touch ID protector ever so slightly &#34;overflowed&#34; onto the screen protector area and is visible with the case installed at the extreme bottom of the display. This is one of the minor build quality issues that I think are characteristic of this price point. Overall I feel the Merit case was worth the money.  EDIT: After a week with the case on my iPhone 6 Plus the volume buttons have become easier to operate with a softer press required. Although the material used to make the Touch ID sensor work is slightly visible one the bottom edge of the display I rarely notice it and if doesn't affect viewing of the display in any way. I have not subjected the phone to submersion in water, but it has been exposed to lots of windblown dust in the desert and as far as I can tell if has not penetrated the case or ports in any way. Prior to opening the charging port door I cleaned the case with a damp paper towel and it was good as new. After a week with the case I have upgraded my review for 4 to 5 stars. Great product Merit.  UPDATE: I have had the Merit case on my iPhone 6 Plus for approximately six weeks now. My only update is that the door/cover for the charging port clips or snaps in place. Over the last month and a half I have noted that on occasion when I remove the phone from my pocket  this door has popped open. This is only a minor inconvenience, but I can imagine that in a more hostile environment than my office this could subject the phone to sand or water. Also, this same door has now chipped on back of the door. I don't recall any substantial drops that would have caused this. A picture is attached. The chip does not seem to impede function, but is unsightly."
-1,"Purchased JETech Bluetooth headset believing it to be \\""noise canceling\\"", but got a headset that had volume control issues, an ear piece that was very uncomfortable to wear more than two hours. The tech who designed this should go back and start all over again."
1,I'm very please my new phone case
1,"Really cool, this thing has a really smart design."
1,Works great!
-1,The image was not clear. It was very fuzzy. I don't use the case.
1,"Perfect gift for my son. He's already dropped the phone twice, and this case really protected it!"
-1,"The color of the device itself is beautiful, I think the pink color is even more vibrant than you really see in the picture.<br /><br />Sadly to say, within 10 minutes of opening the package, I noticed a defect and will be returning this item. The soft material on the inside of the arm band is already peeling off.<br /><br />I purchased this based off of other reviews for people with a OtterBox case. I have an iPhone with an OtterBox commuter series case. I had my phone in the armband and when I got a phone call, I tried to quickly pull the phone out and it was neither quick or easy with the OtterBox case. If you were going to use the armband specifically with headphones that have a microphone this may be easier for you, but I don't use headphones with my phone."
1,"Does the trick, but feels cheap."
1,"I Traded in my old F 150 for a new 2015 Silverado. And I didn't realized how much I'd miss keypad on the Ford. So I started looking for something to put this truck. I did not want to drill holes in my new truck but at the same time I did not want something that looked all ghetto. A month later I decided to go with this unit because it was the most aesthetically pleasing unit i could find to fit the bill. Once I receive the unit. Quickly discovered it came in three pieces. First you get a window sticker (The face or number pad you see in the picture and on the outside of the window). Then the Unit it's self (The brains of the thing if you want to call it that). And Finally the wiring harness. The wiring harness is super simple. You got your basic power wires, lock and unlock wires and then (optional alarm arm and disarm). Realizing the window sticker was a one shot deal. I decided to bench test the unit before I started anything. The Unit it's self has a sticky side with backing on it. Where your supposed to peel the backing off and you stick the unit to the window sticker and you can actually see where the buttons of the unit match up with the buttons on the window sticker. So, I powered up the unit and touch the buttons. Very responsive through the backing material. Yey! Thats a win. Next step. I decided to mount the unit to my rear window. So it's kind of hidden but at the same time easy to get to. Ran and wired up the hardness to where I needed it to be. Then I plugged the hardness into unit. Was able program a 4 digit pin and the pulse for the lock / unlock functions.  And the unit worked flawlessly. Awesome Next step. Clean the window and apply the window sticker to the window. Then mounted the unit to the window sticker on the window. Thing works goodtill works. Because all The LED's still work but. Maybe my hands aren't warm enough or back window too thick. Either way unit does not work. And considering it's made up of stickers. I can't easily be remove to be returned it without damaging it. And since I just wasted my money on this little project. I can't really recommended for anybody."

1,Sound great!! Perfect for my car system!!
1,"This is a nice small and sleek apple watch stand from Nekteck.It is very affordable. It looks really neat on your desk or bedside table. It is made from high grade and luxury aluminum alloy. Which is very strong and give the stand luxurious look. There's no assembly required. Just take it out of the box and start using it.The base has 4 rubber grips, which gives the stand firm grip and it doesn't slide or move while placing the watch on it.It is a solid base for better stabilization.It is designed to charge and rest Apple Watch both 38mm and 42mm. While the watch in on the stand it has a comfortable viewing angle which i really like,Furthermore, it has magnetic charging cable which can be easily inserted and removed in seconds.It It features a circular cut-out to securely fit the charger beneath the watch.This sure is a elegant watch stand that looks great and complements my other Apple products.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping: It was packed in a box. The shipping was very fast. I got the Apple watch stand in two days after placing the order online.I bought it at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review.This sure is a great stand which keeps your Apple Watch clean and safe at night while charging. Plus it has a modern look and feel gives posh, sophisticated vibe to any home or office. Below are few pictures of the Nekteck Apple watch stand that i took when i first received it."
1,Love it
-1,Not very good quality
1,Case came in a timley manner.  All was good and as expected.  Would purchase from here again.
1,My order was handled promptly and satisfied with my purchase.
1,"Bought this for my fiancé to use because he's always running down his batter, travels, etc. He loves it & doesn't go anywhere without it."
1,Dropped my phone twice and it's still alive. Looks nice and doesn't add a lot of bulk. So far so good.
1,official samsung product CONFIRMED.<br /><br />charges my phone in less than 2 hours O_O ... this thing has the good original speed. It's probably best to buy this cord from the seller named &#34;samsung&#34; because other sellers might indeed have a knock-off copy.
1,A+
1,I like it so far.  Easy install and no rattles.
1,Great
1,Excellent case for my iPhone 5S.  Easily handles phone is Otter life defender case.
-1,was not for my phone
1,Great product worked great with my phone Samsung galaxy 6
0,"Was a bit of a pain to work with, but ultimately it did the job."
1,I use this on my motorcycle and it works great. I had one that cost a lot more and didn't work as well. It's nice and stable and makes me feel better about putting my $500 phone on it going 70MPH!
-1,Bought it going by its claim that it works with iPhone6+ but for some reason it isn't working. Straight out of the box it didn't work so not sure if it's just a faulty piece or it's not meant for 6+. I bought it over a month ago and didn't bother using it earlier since I had bought it for an upcoming trip but now it's past that 1 month deadline so I'm stuck with it and I'll have to buy another one from a local store where I could return it right away if it doesn't work. BEWARE !!
0,Looks great! Till the leather started to peel off on all four corners.  Other than that it's good
1,Made a great gift.
1,Heavy duty
-1,"Item stopped working after 45 days.  Good idea, but poor execution on this particular cable."
1,"Love the phone, the camera is the absolute best!  but it's obvious something is wrong with it, and I'll have to return it. The phone has a glitch that makes it black out in the middle of what I'm doing. My emails don't download, Facebook keeps stopping unexpectedly, and I have to constantly restart it. Pretty annoying for an over $400 phone..."
1,LOVE THIS STAND!  It is the perfect stand to watch TV at my desk at work.  Made very sturdy and worth the price!
0,i have soft or love hate relationship with the case. I have bought 3 excatly same cases - black for 5s with logo cut- in last one year. But their life is sadly only 4 mo. Or so. Their thin bridges doesn't last long. But I keep buying them because their is no other nice slimmer with good grip cases are there.  Maybe ringke should do something about it.
0,i didn't prefer the usb cable.
-1,Always disconnected.
-1,"It works line-of-sight only and therefore is not very useful if you're driving and want to control the head unit. It's just as easy to reach over and adjust the head unit manually as to aim this remote at the front of the unit. Also, it's larger than I would like."
1,Good quality and works very well. Doesn't get hot like my Samsung does. Delivered in excellent condition on as promised.
1,"I have had other bluetooth headsets before, but none have worked as good as this one.  When I talk to people using this, they do not even know that I am on a bluetooth set.  That is how good it is.  I also stream music from my iPhone with this and the battery life will keep it going all day.  The phone battery life, not so good.  But that is because the cell signal is poor or low.  I do wear glasses so it does feel a little uncomfortable if the hard plastic &#34;clip&#34; is pressed against the ear a certain way.  I wish it could be made out of a softer material but then it may not last as well as the rigid plastic.  If your glasses have a thin piece that goes over your ear, then it should not give you any issues.  It is lightweight and the volume is loud, so you can hear it over loud noises.<br /><br />If you are expecting high fidelity music streaming, this does not provide it.  Definitely rather have it play music than not since I am not supposed to have music playing while I work.  (The LED does not light up when streaming music.  BONUS!!)<br /><br />I thought I had lost this a while back and the price went up $20.  I will buy another if the price drops back down.  :)"
1,Fast shipping & Great Item
1,"nice case. Fits great. So far I have not dropped it, but hopefully when/if I do it will protect my phone."
1,Love this case.  Holds up good especially with my line of work
0,"virtually no directions.  I wasted on lens just trying to figure out how to apply it.  But if you value your ipod, you should use this product."
1,"Good quality. Sturdy, but not bulky."
-1,[[VIDEOID:a45d104c2d3c1e83d7a4a573738c0c6c]] Quick review of the Apple Watch Strap Band - E LV Apple Watch 42MM - ( DARK BLUE)<br />Its not really the band i'm upset at its the adapter more than anything.
1,Got a great deal on this.  Should have ordered a few more?
1,Works great every single time!
-1,I like the case but the clip is not  as sturdy as they claim. On my first case the clip broke the same day. The clip was replaced and lasted almost a month and it broke again.
1,Fantastic! Better than anticipated and came sooner than estimated.
1,"Overall, this is a good phone case for an iPhone 5/5S.  I have a 5S and it fits well, and I love that it's my favorite color.  For me personally I don't really like the bulkiness it adds to the phone, but that's simply my personal opinion/preference.  Here are some pros/cons I have noticed with the phone.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Includes 2 screen protectors so when one gets dirty or simply needs replacing you have a backup.<br />-Color is beautiful.<br />-Case covers the entire phone (back, sides, and comes over the front border).<br />-There are openings for the speaker and charger on the bottom, the ringer mute switch on the side, and the camera/flash on the back.<br />-Easily fit the charger in the phone while the case is on.<br />-Even with the ringer volume controls covered by the case they are still easy to use and you can feel the button actually press.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Makes the phone itself bulkier.  I have a harder time fitting my hand around the phone/case than I have with other cases, but I've been able to adjust.<br />-The lock button on the top is covered by the case and doesn't always work the first time I press it.  You can't feel the button press like you can with the volume control buttons and I sometimes have to press it 2-3 times for it to lock.<br /><br />*I received this item at a discount to provide an honest review.  My opinions are my own and in no way influenced by the seller."
-1,I usually don't rate products poorly but this is a complete waste of money. The charger does not seat properly so it rarely charges and will flip back and forth between charging and not charging every other second. This charger has a bad connection in either the micro USB port or the connection to the magnetic charge port on the phone. It is poorly designed. Buy something else. I'm looking at the OEM dock now.
1,Nice product and fast service.  It's not a real bass pounder but it adds to the overall sound of the car stereo
1,"I wish this was longer,  to short for what i needed it for"
1,good quality
1,This sticker adapter worked great  on my phone (Tmobile Note 4). No issues with snapping back the cover either.
1,"These are AWESOME! I go through the soft, foam ear pads in a matter of weeks, but I have had these for a year and a half now and they are still going strong - not even a crack in the soft, leather-like material! Very durable, and does nicely keeping the sound out. Well done!!!!"
1,"I'm really happy how the harness turned out. there is 1 issue however. the accessory wire does NOT turn off the stereo. this is an issue on VW's end. simple enough, just rewire the accessory wire to either the fuse panel or the cigarette lighter. personally, I installed it on the fuse panel. (picture for more details). look at the other reviews for tips and advice in the installation of this product."
1,Just got it in the mail put it on and it was very easy there is no lag when touching the screen mand it works well with the otter box commuter series. Recommend buy
1,"I love this case but it won't accommodate the lightening cable from Amazon.  (The Apple cords work fine.) Still, I like it enough to keep using it even though I have to take it out to charge it."
1,"Outstanding quality. The case feels amazing like a high end 70 dollar case. Highly recommended. I wish I would've got this first, instead of that expensive otterbox commuter case"
1,"So far so good... Fast, camera is iffy. Overall great phone for the price. Call quality isn't very good.. Kinda quiet.. Sometimes scratchy.. Might be my location though, I don't get the best service area.."
1,"it is a nice pen for the price, works great with the ipad, and the ink side is nice.  the only thing is the pen is a bit short, but other than that I love it."
1,Super nice!
1,Good stock replacement - They are okay.
1,Way cheaper than the AT&T store for a very similar quality product.
1,Does everything it purports to do.  Very good protection for an expensive GPS unit.
1,Great fit and decent audio. First picture is incorrect. Earbud must be used in right ear.
1,Everything fit perfectly
0,Doesnt fit the cards as well as I thought and that mirror is awful
1,Working great!  Worth the price.
1,For a while I had one that used suction to stick to the top of my dashboard. On many hot days it would become loose and fly off. I love this design as it mounts on the vents and never flys off.
0,Picture seems to actually be a sticker on back of phone case... I imagine it will start to peel off soon.
0,It's ok but not so sure I would put anything in the pocket located in the back of the case that would really be a pain in they @55 to replace or that you have to report stolen. Bit it is do'able for the price
1,All very good
0,Excellent
1,Basically does what it is supposed to and is pretty useful (particularly while traveling). Faster charging would be awesome but I guess that is in general a technical challenge and cost prohibitive...
-1,This product worked for a total of three days.  I used the headphones two days at the gym and they worked fine and easily paired. On the third day they would not pair.  The battery was fully charged and I could hear the &#34;power on&#34; and  &#34;power off&#34; feedback but they were undiscoverable and would not pair.
-1,did no work on my GPS
1,"Since I never play CDs in the slot, this is a perfect place to install the mount, and the clever use of a magnet between my phone and back cover provides a secure and easy grip that doesn't deteriorate like those based on some form of stickiness.  This innovative mount is fantastic."
1,"Absolutely the best headset for serious business people who need to hear and be heard on a cell phone while in and out of different environments throughout the work day. This is a no frills headset, you can't listen to your music via Bluetooth through it or hear your nav directions through it (which can be good), but if you want to hear clearly and be heard clearly in and out of airports, cars, or while walking the busy streets, there is none better. With the larger filter on the mic I can drive on secondary roads, 45mph, with top off my jeep and hear and be heard with little to no issues. Amazing.  I have had 6 etymotic headsets, tried the wired version and keep one as a backup in case I lose battery power for Bluetooth version. The wired version is bombproof. Only criticism of the Bluetooth version rated here is it is a bit fragile which is why I have purchased a few of these over the years. Despite the fragility, I keep coming back to this product after having tried virtually every other highly rated brand. Nothing comes close to this if you are a professional and need something that absolutely works, period."
1,Use it all the time. Much better than the windshield suction cup.
-1,The case itself holds up fine but the graphic on the back is a sticker with poor adhesive.  I've had it on my phone for a week and the sticker is already coming off.  This is a poor case and I'm disappointed that I bought it.
1,Great for 28v aircraft power systems
1,I got wrong  one
0,Didn't hold up as well as we hoped.
1,"Great product, has just about everything you need to get the job done!"
0,"This is my replacement set and I am very disappointed.  My first gave good sound and never messed up,  this pair (which is also refurbished) goes in and out all the time.  Maybe I should stick to new.  I'm not so happy"
1,Perfect arrived on time my husband loves it
1,Works as expected
1,"The case fits well, feels very solid and is easy to hold on to, and the built in screen protector works well.  It isn't quite as easy to put on as the video (which is the only installation instruction, a link is provided for it but no printed manual).  For a phone which will be riding in a pocket, likely dropped many times, it should be well protected.  The screen protector is plastic, not glass, but is clear and smooth.  If it does wear out, it shouldn't be hard to replace it."
1,"[[VIDEOID:f74ea91be658ade5bff7e1ac854a6877]] The Smarteck Qy8 Bluetooth 4.1 Headphone arrived within a couple days of being ordered via Prime. It was particularly well packaged with the outer device box containing two individual boxes.  The Bluetooth 4.1 specification was introduced in December 2013; the current specification, 4.2, was introduced in December 2014 and included some privacy enhancements. Bluetooth devices operate at approximately 2.4 GHz.  Most mobile devices are class 2 with a range of approximately 10 meters or 33 feet.<br /><br />OPERATION<br />I tested the headset with my mobile phone initially without charging. The received audio quality was acceptable, but that sent was not. Following several hours of charging using the included USB charging cable, I repeated the test using Skype's Echo Sound Test Service. This time, the audio sent and received was quite acceptable. Charging devices before use is generally recommended.<br /><br />The accompanying video demonstrates the use of the charging cable. A port for the mini USB connector is located on the side of one ear phone. A flap is readily pulled back using your finger nail. Once the standard USB end of the cable is plugged in, the QCY text on the other ear phone will display a red lighting. The red light will remain on until the cable is disconnected.<br /><br />Pairing with my Android cell phone and Microsoft Surface 2 Pro occurred without incident. Once paired, the headphone requires a few seconds to connect, assuming you have turned the headset on. To turn it on, press the button associated with the ear phone that has the volume control on the side; holding it down for 3-4 seconds is required. Turning the device on or off is associated with light and audible English speech indicators.<br /><br />OVERALL EVALUATION<br />As Bluetooth devices go, this one is probably as good as any, particularly in its price range. That being said, I've gotten much better audio quality results from a $30 USB wired headset than any Bluetooth device, including one for which I paid well in excess of $140. If wireless is a non-negotiable requirement, this headset is certainly worth considering. The Smarteck Qy8 is relatively inexpensive and features an 80mH battery reputed to support up to 7 hours of active use or 175 hours in standby.  It also comes with four additional ear buds in varying sizes.<br /><br />Ultimately, I gave the Smarteck Qy8 headset four stars.  It's a bit more complicated to use than my $140 Plantronics single ear device. Like any Bluetooth device, audio quality is not as good as with an inexpensive wired headset. The accompanying printed manual also pretty much required a magnifying glass to read so I didn't bother trying. By watching the accompanying video, you shouldn't have to read it either. Like Amazon Vines, I received this device in return for an unbiased technical review. Unlike Vines, less than 10% of my reviews are compensated. I usually spend an hour or more creating a video review, so I would appreciate you marking it helpful if appropriate.headset than any Bluetooth device, including one for which I paid well in excess of $140.

1,"great product easy to use, fitted well"
1,Great product but beware it is not NFC or wireless charging friendly.
1,good cell.
-1,Defective product.  2 out of the 4 charging ports do not work.
1,Bought this for my daughter's galaxy note and she loves it - great quality.
1,"I purchased this for my mother in law. She loved it! It is so pretty. I find it unusual that the harder plastic cover comes apart from the teal, rubbery part, but it works great. It fit her phone perfectly."
1,"For what it is, I like it alot.  I have not dropped my phone yet (knock on wood) and it does not feel as secure in my hands as the rubber cover I had, but it is what it is and does feel like it can protect my phone."
1,Came exactly on time and is excellent quality. The sides are rubbery so there's no breakage like with a lot of cases. I really like the feel of the coverings for the volume buttons and hold button. 10/10
-1,"Didn't work properly with my Note 4, very dissappointed."
1,"Just received today, and I am really impressed. This piece of equipment is a real good headset for me."
1,Works great
-1,I purchased this case mainly for the belt clip/protective front cover which works well. The case itself though is another story. The fit isn't tight at all and you can easily slip the phone out of its protective layer without removing the backside hard shell. The silicone is just too soft and slippery. I am using the belt clip with a different manufacturers case (MoKo) that I also purchased on Amazon. That case is much more secure and retains the phone very well. I wish it had come with the belt clip portion like this case has since then it would have been perfect. All in all this is an inexpensive item so I won't knock it as it does add some protection to your phone and provides a kick stand so you can prop your phone up to watch a video etc. I probably would have paid as much just for the belt clip portion of this case if I were to buy it at a local retailer. Maybe my example wasn't perfect and another may fit tightly. I had the same issues with covers for a couple older Apple I Pod touch's where the silicone was just so slippery and soft that the I Pod would simply slide right out with any use. Hope this helps someone that is looking for a case for the Moto G. I would highly recommend the MoKo branded version as that case fits much more securely and also offers the kick stand.
1,"The only reason I did not give the phone case 5 stars was the cut out for the on and off was much to small. I had to make it bigger.  It took a  quite a while  I needed to use a knife, scissors  and a nail clipper.  I finally got it big enough and now it is fine.  The case was  a great price and it arrived much quicker then they estimated."
1,"ok headphones....I went cordless because Im a welder and often Im alone for long periods of time welding for hours. I got regular head phones but they seemed to always break at the 3.5 jack that connects to the phone. With these so far so good, Im on vacation so I cant really say they are good or not yet but I will update when i return to work."
1,Its barely even noticeable and its pretty thick.
0,"It's a nice case.  Looks good, fits the phone really well, and the grip is ok.  Felt a little slippery at first but for the most part it's been ok not great.  My wife has only had it for 2 months and the red coating on the outer shell is already chipping off near the edges."
1,"it fit my 2005 mercury mariner great, and looked good with the existing console, my new radio looks pretty good and the install went smoothly."
1,Nice product!
1,"i absolutely love this! its so soft! and my phone fits it perfectly! plus i dont have to carry my big ol purse, just stick the cards  use in the side pockets! it works great. i just throw it on the side of my baby diaper bag now so its so much easier to carry! thank you for making this a review product!"
1,"[[VIDEOID:81d6d464a3e989f9ed3070556f759119]] I got a free sample of this for review.<br /><br />I know it says \\""green\\"" and \\""red\\"" in the description, but the pictures are correct: they are indeed mint and pink. Which isn't a bad thing: it is a very nice pink colour, and it goes surprisingly well with the gold of the plastic bottom that slides out to make it easy to put the phone into the case.<br /><br />It comes in a nice, plastic retail case, which looks pleasant enough, and would still be nice if this were to be given away as a present to someone special.<br /><br />The cover also covers the buttons on the side, protecting them too, and the whole thing feels very comfortable in the hand, offering a good grip with its nice rubbery material.<br /><br />I didn't have an iPhone at hand when I made the video, but a later test confirms it is a nice, tight and secure fit, all buttons and sockets easily accessible and a much improved grip over the bare phone itself.<br /><br />It does build a little bit of thickness to the iPhone, but not excessively so. It adds little weight, almost making it feel lighter because of the increased size, but that added size is also padding that will potentially protect your expensive iDevice from a lot of knocks and falls.<br /><br />The rubbery material has a bit of bounce to it, which will help absorb shocks much better than many other back covers I've seen, also having a nice edge extending above screen height which might save it from a face-down fall to the ground<br />as well.<br /><br />In short: it's a nice cover that I can certainly recommend - if you like the styling and colour of it."
1,"Works fine, no problems."
1,"Works well, its a bit thicker then the original but still works very well!"
1,"works great, charges fast"
-1,lousy product breaks easily and cost just as much to get a replacement.  Not worth it.
0,Classy and elegant but too tight for the Samsung Galaxy Light 4G (the inside has a label marked iphone5S?). Difficult to get phone and all sorts of buttons are pressed and changes to the phone. I think we got the wrong product ... can we still exchange it?
1,Great price. Does everything it's supposed to do!
1,"Delivered very quickly. Well packaged.<br />Unit feels very solid and made well. Jacks feel secure not flimsy. I used it to charge my Nexus 5 and an iPhone 6 - not at same time, duh, but right after each other.. Both started at about 20% battery and charged to about 95% on both.. Only consumed 2 led lights off the unit. I was very happy to see it can handle this capacity. This isbgreat if you're going out for a full day and having more than one device to recharge.<br />Im very happy with this purchase.. As long as they don't change anything I suspect you will be, too."
1,This is a tad bulky and heavy but its great for long events like concerts when you will be sucking the juice from your phone and esp when your friends phones die and they always want your portable charger!!!
1,"It's kind of hard to get off without damaging it, but overall I like it. There was a little condensation over the camera lens, so I'm not sure if moisture got in or was already there."
1,Worked very well.  Ocean boating was a breeze.
1,LOVE ITTTT
-1,the swirl did not met my expectations.  The ability to extend the stylus was difficult in that it came out and the part that is to fit into my 6Iphone is too narrow to fit snugly and therefore they fell off  often .
1,Fit phone perfectly.
1,"This is a fantastic head unit.  Installed this with my factory sound system and did the Auto EQ / Time Delay adjustment and it made my system sound much better.  Eventually replaced the factory speakers with JBLs and a sub, did the Auto EQ again and bam, amazingness.<br /><br />The only thing that sucks about this unit:<br /><br />No FLAC Support :(<br /><br />No 64GB SDCard support.  Haven't tried 64GB USB sticks.  Will read 32GB SD Cards<br /><br /> Bluetooth support is meh.  Android will support changing tracks from the head unit / remote, iPod / iphone via bluetooth will not.  USB iphone/ ipod works perfectly.  I wish it would support metadata via bluetooth; like song names or currently playing internet radio station, but it does not.<br /><br />A small issue: when visualisation is active on the unit, and you hit 'DISP' to see the title of the current playing track or radio station, it will only display for 2 seconds - it will occasionally not scroll through the entire name in that time, so you will only catch the first 12 characters of whatever your playing off your SD card or removable media.  If the visualisation is off, it will constantly scroll the entire track name.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants high quality audio control of their vehicle but does not want to outfit their whip with a bulky multimedia display"
-1,Color of the band is different from the color of the grey Apple Watch (more reddish). The tool for band length adjustment is too weak to push out the pin from the link to remove it - need to bring to a watch shop for adjustment.
1,Worked great exact replacement Sirius sportster 5 very satisfied
1,Got just what I needed!
1,OK
-1,I could say is good but I don't use because I ordered wrong one.
1,Love the Pebble Steel and can't beat the price.
-1,The blue part was loose it wouldn't attach to the green part.
1,"I use this every day with my galaxy note 3, Charges it up no problem, very quick. This is a high quality product. I have used other anker products in the past, all amazing.  Never had any problems but my friends tell me that their customer service is unmatched."
-1,I wish this case was made better! Both layers are a hard plastic that does not work well with each other. Me and my husband got this same case for different phones in different colors and we both had the same problem. Our phones kept popping out the case. Whether it was a corner or one of the sides for some reason it wouldn't stay put. I honestly think its because the case is 2 hard plastics together vs. the alt silicone/gel base and hard plastic cover. We loved the idea of having the kick stand and the cool look but being functional is always top priority! I mean what's the use of added features to a car that doesn't drive??
1,Blink blink
1,have preferred these 2x already will be ordering more great quality for the price
1,I love it! No complaints here!
1,So nice to have a multi-usb port to use. We have several products that use the usb cords to charge so this is perfect for my family. I received this product free or at a discount for my unbiased review.
1,Good product
1,"Had a problem, it was resolved quickly and professionally.  Great device.  Mounted the 520 on my Trike (sky-cycle).  Purchased the 5&#34; because of the smaller size.  Now, I'm thinking there may be enough room for the 7&#34;.  Thank you Sarasota and IFly !!  :)"
1,Thank you I got my order in perfect condition and the packadge was wonderful thank you very much I really like your service
1,This is the best iPhone case I've had and the TARDIS design is perfection!
-1,I would not buy this again.  It's cheap enough. But you get what you pay for. I have an i-phone 4 (the little one) and this does not hold it correctly. It now holds my post it notes on my desk because it cannot hold anything heavier. The only reason I gave it a 2 stars is because it's cheap enough
-1,"Bought 2 and both ended up chipping and breaking.  I thought that maybe I did something to break the first one, but after purchasing the second on and putting a case on, it ended up chipping the three different places.  Totally disappointed."
1,"POWER POWER POWER! This sums it up, it provides all the power for my phones (Nexus 5 and OnePlus One). How much power?! 2.1 Amp PER USB PLUG! None of this BS 2.1 Amp if you use 1 plug crap... Nope we charge two devices at a full 2.1A ... Love this plug."
1,"This case is awesome and it fits and functions great on my phone, dust and splash resistant with all the ports covered!<br />Would recommend!"
1,Great device and the lights are really nice
-1,Lasted 2 months. Won't record nor will the on screen menu show up on the screen.
1,Really great case my last one was making my phone over heat and this is exactly what i needed and it fits perfect ive had multiple compliments..
1,Most car chargers don't work very well. This one is great! I received a discount on my order for a fair review.
1,Nice phone
1,"This is a terrific product!  It doesn't smear with fingerprints and even when I dropped my phone, the company replaced it at half price.  Great value for the money -- in fact, terrific value since other stores charge $50 for the same product!"
1,Worked great & fit perfectly! Great find for the price!
1,Exactly what I wanted and delivered on time.
1,"I used these on two new phones.  The cut was precise, and they went on easy.  Can't beat the price.  I just hope I never have to find out if they protect as well as the big $$$ brands."
1,A great battery for a great phone. Some of us power users need more than the standard and this is perfect. There isn't a bigger battery on the market. A full charge will last you at least three days. It's going to take a couple charging cycles for the phone to recognize the battery fully and you won't have to panic and rush for a charger at one percent either. 1% of a 10000 mah battery is another 5 hrs. Just try not to constantly run the battery down to 0.
1,"It's a good case, I love it"
1,Great selfies stick. Came as expected. Fits my Nixon coolpix camera perfectly and my galaxy S4 with a mophie charger attached to it. Great item. Extends perfectly without twisting for a great photo. Thank you
-1,Worked for two weeks and now doesn't charge at all. I had one exactly like this and it lasted for almost a year.
1,Excellent product.
0,It broken send me one
0,no comment
1,Works
1,Two chargers for one and they both work really good!
0,"This is slim, and much thinner than I was expecting. After 3 days of use, there are strings coming off of it from the stitching. My husband loves it, so that is all that really matters.  The quality isn't quite up to par, but for this cheap, you get what you pay for."
-1,Phone had a lot of cracks. Also when installing the service to the phone the worker said it was water damaged. Come to find out the speakers became loud static and Bluetooth to a wireless speaker sounds far worse. I would not recommend or order from this user again.
1,Good product for great price
1,"Quick delivery, case looks great.  Everything was exactly as promised."
1,"Lightening cables in my house disappear quicker than the charge on my phone.  It seems like whenever I want to charge my iPhone, the charging cable is missing.  We have 3 iPhones in the house and we were down to 2 charging cables.  I purchased this Kinps 3ft lightening cable, MFI certified, so that I could have my own cable. I purchased black since the others are white and now I will know its mine.  The cable works just like it should.  Since it is MFI certified, I have had no problems syncing my phone to my computer.  The charging speed is great.  My phone seems to charge a bit quicker than it did.  The cable is 3ft long so I am able to use my phone while it charges.  I will be getting another one of these cables.  I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
-1,"So, so"
-1,The cover is gorgeous but as soon I open the case and put my cards in the materials were coming over ( the seam)<br />and the case to hold the phone is cracking.
-1,Dghfhcg
1,amazing product. gives a good backup of 3 full charges to my galaxy s4.
-1,Both cables stopped working this week. The connection between the cable and the plastic broke and frayed the wires on one and the other charges for about a minute and then says accessory not supported. Don't waste your time or money
1,i really like it
1,Very well fitting case all button work only drawback is you have to remove phone back cover. But the protection it provides is well worth it.
-1,peeled off with in 1 week
1,"This phone cost about $20 more than the avail 2, and some other phones. The quality of this is like going from a regular car to a Cadillac.It works so easy,and has far more features,than one would want,and more than you'd expect from a phone at this price.Try it, you might like it!"
1,Love it fits perfectly protects phone the best case
0,the On/OFF button area is too hard to press. Should have a slit along each length of button area to release tension to the rubber and allow easy press of it.
-1,One of the earpieces broke within a week of receiving it!
1,Good so far
1,Worked well
0,Love that they are 10ft long.  One issue I have is that one of the plugs that plugs into your phone or tablet does not plug in very well at.  It wiggles and doesnt keep it charging.
-1,There was a piece broken off the side of the case.<br />I managed to glue it but there is a gap.<br />Not very happy.<br />The case would be fine if it was in one piece.<br />I already sent a response via packaging review.
1,Really enjoyed this for my trip to Hawaii. It was perfect for hiking and we got some great underwater pictures. The only reason for four stars was that the touch screen could be really sensitive or non-responsive. We had a few pictures we wanted to get but couldn't get to the app to take a picture in time. But my phone survived the trip and the lenses were a lot of fun. We took a lot of pictures that we wouldn't have been able to take otherwise. It was awesome on a 14 hour kayak trip and an 8 hour hike to a waterfall.
-1,"With the white bumper around the phone, my headphone and charger port was blocked. It's really hard to put on and take off, so after a week I kept the bumper off. The phone still felt quite protected, and there's been several times my phone fell and this seemed to help protecting my phone.<br />The case discolors very quickly. I purchased this in late June 2015, and now 2 months later, it is faded and very dirty looking.<br />I can't be too upset on the discoloration based on the affordable price of this case, but I am upset to see how part of the case makes the most important parts of the phone inaccessible."
1,Love this product. Adds all the functionality of Bluetooth enabled car. Only downside is the very loud voice informing me Bluetooth is connected or not. I can see that on my phone and the voice is super loud over my stereo.
1,"Great case.  Just wished the glitter moved more, but it is beautiful. Would highly recommend."
0,Works for me :)
1,"Second time buying this item! Dropped my phone at work and happened to catch the ONE screw in my whole computer office that I did not pick up, thus cracking the protective screen. I reordered this on amazon and got a new one in the mail next day.When putting on the new screen there was a little bubble defect in the one corner. After calling Luvvitt they promptly, no questions asked, sent me a new screen two days after request was put in. The new screen went on just fine and my phone is once again protected. I would recommend this product to ANYONE looking for a screen cover. My co-woker has a $40 screen protector and honestly I could not tell the difference between mine and hers (I am VERY picky and detailed). She tried to explain &#34;well hers comes with lifetime replacement warranty and all she has to do is pay $15 for replacement now.... I paid $12 and free replacement when the screen had a bubble.... Beat that!"
1,"Simply Great, period"
1,"Real nice, they work well and stay on well.  Happy with the both covers"
1,"**UPDATE: I've now purchased two more of these for family BDays who adore them as well (especially for the receiving calls bit). This really is an arguably great buy. I also have customer service on speed email; they answer every question...and lightning fast.**<br /><br />To be honest, I never understood what the big darn deal was with all those pill shaped Bluetooth speakers at Best Buy. Sure, they look cool. And have decent sound. They are also ridiculously expensive versus seemingly much more capable, larger AirPlay counterparts. (My [[ASIN:B00903HKIS Pioneer XW-SMA1-K A1 Wi-Fi Speaker featuring AirPlay, DLNATM, HTC Connect and Wireless Direct (Discontinued by Manufacturer)]] is a rock star.)<br /><br />So when Vtin offered me the opportunity to review their Waterproof bluetooth speaker, I was intrigued...but honestly expected a 3-star review, at best. I didn't pay for this. And was likely to pan it.<br /><br />I'm eating crow.<br /><br />This baby is powerful. The bass on it is superb, likewise the mid-high level clarity. Build quality is surprisingly quite good for a $40 speaker. This feels VERY solid, has nice seals (for a supposedly waterproof device), buttons are responsive and nicely rubberized. No, I'm not running water over this guy to confirm...but feel cautiously confident it could take it.<br /><br />Sync was seamless for an iPhone (it took seconds), also playback. Just be careful to hold down the volume buttons during playback, or risk skipping songs.<br /><br />I discovered a bit of finickiness, however, when attempting to sync with another device...in this instance, an iPad Air 2. Bluetooth must be turned off on the original to de-sync the speaker. Turning the speaker on/off likewise is needed, in most instances, to properly reset. Closing a device or app will NOT de-sync.<br /><br />Phone use is perhaps the most impressive part of this device. The Vtin Waterproof Speaker handles calls like an ace, seamlessly switching back/forth between music playback and phone call. Mic is crystal clear. The mute button likewise works as advertised.<br /><br />For self employed peeps (who use music/calls regularly), this speaker is the bomb. I used the [[ASIN:B00GOI1HJA Pwr+ Extra Long 6.5 Ft AC Adapter 2.1A Rapid Charger for Asus Transformer Tablet Book T100 T100TA T100TAM T100TAF; Transformer Pad MG10 MG103C TF103C TF103CX TF0310C B1 C1 H1 H2 B1 B11 A1 10.1 Inch]] charger to keep this guy power happy.<br /><br />Last, customer service is surprisingly outstanding.

1,Works great!
1,My S-10 works very well. I'm a happy camper with my purchase.
1,Good product
1,"I use this on my bike with a Samsung Galaxy S6 with the Otter Box case. The roads in my town are not that great, and when hitting bumps, my phone doesn't even move. The bands fit just perfectly to still plug in my headphones. The bands do fit very snugly, so I hope they don't stretch over time.<br /><br />P.S. Please don't mind the dust on my bike. I was gone for a month."
1,"Love it, doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone compared to other otter box cases. The pink exactly matches the pink iPhone 5c. The grey on it looks great too. Was easy to install"
1,Happy with delivery time and product! I like that the charger tip lights up to help see in the dark!
-1,Super cute but the first time my phone droped on my wood floor it cracked my screen.  I had a cheaper case on it before that protected my phone from hitting concrete several times and never had any issues.  Unfortunate...should've just kept my worn out one on.
1,"This works good on the mirror mount on the handlebars .I noticed that on my FJR that it had a place to mount a mirror on the handlebars that was not used due to the mirrors being mounted on the faring . I just bought a 10mm x 1.25mm bolt and painted is satton black , I thought I would have to drill it out due to it being stated it was 9mm but it threaded right on . By the way this would work with the mirror still being used no need for a bolt then .  I'm not sure if it would work very well with 8 mm mirrors.<br />Larry"
1,This little gadget really reminds me to not forget my cell phone before leaving the house.  Great for me.
1,"Love it!!! Looks great, feels great, no complaints. Everything I wanted in a case, looks good and my phone is well protected."
1,I gave this to a friend for a gift and she absolutely loves it dresses her phone up nicely
0,Too small for a phone in a case.
1,Great portable Charger for the money!
1,"AMAZING product! Exactly as expected, and a perfect fit for my Galaxy S6."
-1,"Was VERY excited to receive this. I thought it was perfect for my son's scooter. Alarm system works like a charm. I activated a new line with AT&T and installed the iPhone 4 SIM card as instructed (I think. The lights blink slowly, but the off switch doesn't turn the unit off. Have to reset it for them to turn off.) I downloaded the app. I am able to locate the scooter thru real-time tracking, but the device shows as offline. Can't get it to respond to text messages and can't setup the sos phone number. :( My son is disabled and needs this scooter for college. Can't afford another one if it's stolen so I need this working. 1 star until it works."
1,this charger is so cute only down side is that its poorly made the ports either come off or it just stops working. Either way my clients love it I would buy again for the 4th time!
1,I just got it today (very quick delivery) & it fit just right & it is sturdy so far & has a good grip & the design is 100% how it looks in the picture c:
1,Very good protection. A little hard to put on and not moveable if it is not lined up
-1,No good broke in 1 week
1,It's a great screen protector but like others have already mentioned the little tabs on the corners eventually peel up. These really should be sold in a multi-pack because you'll end up replacing it every month or two.
1,"Works well, has guide lines."
-1,Once you use the case for a while it doesn't stay the same color and my white part is peeling.  Other then that it's a good case. But don't think I'll buy again
1,"This is so handy to have when you're out all the time, or doing long distance drives. I don't go anywhere without it."
1,Good case! Way better then the first one I bought for my phone. The first one didn't fit right and there wasn't a hard case!
-1,"The plug prongs that plug into the wall outlet are set lower than other models like this. The lower placement makes it so that the top of the charger blocks the 2nd outlet. In my opinion, I would prefer to have the use of my second outlet, so this is getting returned."
1,Product was in good shape.. NEW.  It works perfect.
1,This is an excelent radio fits perfect it was exactly what i was looking for
1,It arrived on time as promised. I love the product! it holds my phone perfectly while it's charging and navigating for directions.
1,I have extra if my screen protector brakes
1,"The edges don't seem to seal on the Note 5, other than that it was very easy to install and I'm very happy with it so far."
-1,The case is actually to big for the LG G4 phone.
0,"Ok, but it does not come with the adhesive to attach it to the screen,  so the calibration is of a bit since I had to use a different kind of tape."
1,protects the phone but with no screen cover it will get scratched.
-1,One of them was bent upon arrival.  Will u replace.
1,"Works great, like it supposed to, would definitely recommend."
1,"&#34;Really simple device -<br />Fisheye lens and macro lens.<br />+ The macro lens is amazing - I was able to zoom in to text on the say the back of a crisp packet or look at the fine detail of the skin - my iPhone camera would not allow me to do this without the use of the lens. This is going to be really good for photography invertebrates and sections of plants as I go through the summer - brilliant.<br />+ I didn’t think too much of the fisheye lens - but it did do as designed - so depends on your needs<br />+CPL lens-:Eliminate reflections or enhance saturation, and is great for removing unwanted reflections from non-metallic surfaces such as glass or water.<br />These are really good and I can highly recommend - it’s amazing how cheaply you can improve your photography experience<br />&#34;"
1,"Great battery case, love the removable colored frames. Would be nice if they offered more colors separately though!"
-1,Awful phone. Over priced
1,best thing evah!
1,"Work great, price great"
-1,Hooked it up to a 100 watt per channel output.(with crossover for high output only)<br />And it still damaged 2 of the 4 speakers i purchased.
-1,"The unit is made very nice and sturdy, but if you have steeply angled air vents (such as the ones on a 2014 Hyundai Tucson), it's not practical to use.  Only recommend for air vents that have a more vertical orientation."
1,"Bought to replace a disappointing battery from RayOVac/Batteries Plus which was not lasting a day.  Went to them after none of the $5 motorola batts sold online that I tried were out of date and wouldn't hold up.  This battery is lasting through the day with about a 50% drain, which is good for an old droid x.  The battery did fit in without a modified cover, but it was tight and I had to pressure the door a bit to get it to close."
1,"As advertised! works great, cant beat the price!!!"
1,"Pretty amazing GPS.  Very accurate, clear with a huge screen.  My only gripe is that it does not show where the red light cameras are.  That would really help considering we have so many in the NYC area."
0,"It runs a little big,"
1,perfect thank you
1,fits my phone perfectly and it got delivered so quickly!
1,"Loooooove it, great price, looks better then the pic. Fast service. I will sure recommend it. I'm a happy client."
1,Exactly what I was hoping to get! Tough but with a feminine touch. Thx!
1,"This works great for phones both Apple and Android , but my observation ipad charge up time is significantly (25%) slower than directly plugging into Apple Ipad Charger."
0,"I ordered one for a good price, and I ordered the right size, but it came in the wrong size. Wish it would've came in the right size. Other than that it was cool."
1,Great Case for my phone :)
1,"It works perfect. Simple, fast charging works great with my s6 edge. The weight is less than the average of this charger size. And with a rapid charger, the choetec charges in less than 2 hours. Excellent. Recommended."
1,"love it, so cute"
1,it does what I needed it to do.
-1,Only two of the charger cables worked. The third cable did not work at all.
1,great itim
1,Very happy with my purchase.
-1,The thing that holds my gopro in place snapped within 2 month of ownership. Good thing I did not lose my gopro! At first I have nothing but good things to say about this product but in time I realized it is the same as all the cheap quality selfie sticks I have seen. Go spend a little more money just to get the best quality.
1,Ok
1,"All you could ask for!  I've owned a portable solar charger before but it was junk compared to this!  Lightweight and sturdy. A quality product! For the price you can't beat it! I do most of my travelling on a motorcycle, so not having a charger outlet becomes a hassle. This keeps my phone at 100% until I reach my destination. Customer service is also as good. Had a question regarding the product and received an answer within the hour. AWESOME PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE"
1,"This is a fun little gadget! If you are like me and enjoy taking selfies and group photos but have a hard time getting everyone in the picture, this makes it SO much easier!<br /><br />It's pretty small when folded down, which is nice because I can just toss it in my purse and take it out whenever needed for a fun picture or group photo. It held my Galaxy S4 with no problem, but it was a bit of a stretch for my husbands iPhone 6Plus. It may be suited to smaller phones, just to be sure that they are held in place nice and tight. Nothing will ruin a selfie quicker than having the phone come crashing down, right?<br /><br />The Bluetooth was easy to pair and synced to my phone quickly. With the push of a button, I can take my pics and it has not given me any problems at all so far. I received one to review and have had a lot of fun playing around with it since it arrived. This would also definitely make an awesome gift for any selfie lover you might know!"
1,"I'm beyond thrilled with this product!<br />My hands are really shaky so I could put it on 100% straight but it's so pretty! I just put it on and already received so many compliments, not to mention the extremely fast shipping 😍<br />It's worth every peny!"
1,"I have seen some complaints about the EL lights not working after a short period of time, but I have had this cable most of the summer and use it once a day at night to recharge my phone. I have had no problem with this product and the lights still illuminate and &#34;move&#34; when charging a device. I think it is a good product if used gently and responsibly."
0,The phone I purchase from Amazon was sent to members of the family friends I do not have any rating at this present time there was no complain from those family members about the phone its old phones are still working if the phone was in this country I could give it a 5 star but at this present time I could give it the three star but no complain
-1,"not water proof, but only water resistant. My phone got wet when I took it underwater, but I continue to use this case when I take my phone near the water to protect from splashes."
-1,Waste of money...tips don't  register on screen taps.
1,Good product
1,This screen protector came equipped with all you need to clean and flatted the fit to perfection. It was easy to apply with no air bubbles. I love it!!! I recommend this product to everyone with a cell phone.
-1,Poor sound quality people on other end of call could not hear me speaking...I guess you get what you pay for
1,Like it.
1,This is my favorite case. I broke the top part that snaps on and i decorated the back cover with expensive diamond pieces and i cant find a top snap on that will snap with this one. Is there any way you can make more of these? I also sell them after decorating them so i need more.
-1,"Case discolors and scratches easily. Okay protection, but much better options out there for the price."
1,I'm a utility worker. I'm in my truck & utility rooms all day. Not only does the mount work great in the truck... The magnetic piece on the phone allows me to stick my phone on any bit of metal and work hands free. The Center console on my truck it also metal. No more digging between the seats to fish out the fallen phone... This little novelty item has really simplified my work day. Ive already recommended these handy little tool to my company and co workers... Great product.
1,The charger charges fast and the recharges your devices fast.  Great product.
1,really strong material to hold your phone while jogging and working out. I put it in on the sleeve of my shirt and it stays there while I work out.
-1,Don't fit
1,Great products great prices
1,Good
-1,think it may be why radio only worked 2 weeks
1,Great.
-1,band broke after 2 weeks and item lost
1,Great Product. Just what I expected.
1,it's great
1,"I think this phone case is great! I always love the idea of having a slot for a card or ID.  I use it when I go out at night and do not want to carry around a purse or some sort so I hold my ID in this.  Also, the case is very strong and cover the whole phone very well.  I dropped it numerous of time as well and I haven't had any scratches.  The case is very light as well and not too big making it easy to carry and bring around.<br /><br />I review his product at a discount price in exchange for an honest review."
-1,Can't use it to store apps and the other huge space takers on my phone.
1,"It is exactly what I was looking for, paid for and received."
1,Nice and sturdy.
1,"got them super quick, iv had them for a while now and the colors are still so vivid and not a single scratch on them and that's cause i drop my phone A LOT."
1,Item was exactly as stated! Cables were like new! Sync and all specified functions work perfectly.
0,"Very thick wire, seems to be true to gauge, but as it says is 90% aluminum, which isn't the best conductor. It was fine for what I'm running and the spot that I needed to fix, and should be fine as long as your amp is in the lower range of requiring a 4 gauge power cable, but I wouldn't use it for anything over 700w because of the heavy aluminum content. Good wire for the price, but it's better to go with a full copper wire."
-1,"This looks like it could be a good tool but mine arrived with two of the locks missing the feet that hold the screen down, making it mostly useless.  I returned this one and bought  [[ASIN:B011KF8UHS something similar]] for significantly less and while I'm happy with the replacement it has less usable surface area so it won't lock on to anything bigger than an iPhone6.  That said I use it for heating the screen module then I separate it manually with an [[ASIN:B00SERJQUG iSesamo]], which is one of the best tools I have for this kind of work."
1,"II've had this for around a month or more now, and i love this product.  i really like the convenience of having my items in one place instead of strung all over the place like i had to have in the past.  it's easy to hook up the devices if it is done right.  i told 2 of my friends, and showed it to them, and they said that they were going to order it also since that they like how it looks, and the convenience of this product.<br /><br />yes i would recommend this product to my friends and family....."
1,"Love my blue. I can say this phone is all studio blue saz it is. The extras are fantastic to have.<br />I ditched my high end android.. For this sleek beauty.. And happy I did.. Hats off to you studio blu ,keep up the good work.."
1,Great product.
1,Fits the phone perfectly snug and looks slick.  Has a good grip as well to avoid having the phone slip out of my hands.
-1,This case was not what I thought it would be don't like it at all
-1,i've purchased 3 and they all tore apart in the same place.  cheap material for a cheap product. will never purchase again
1,"I go to gym on a daily basis and it's my habit to hear songs when I exercise. These earbuds are just perfect. These are sweat-proof and stays comfortably in the ear. The sound quality is too good and with hours of listening, my ears still comfortable. Love these! I am lucky to have them as a sample."
1,I love this mini speaker. It's so useful and loud! I last a really long time around 4-5 hours for me. I had Prime so it arrived 2 days after I ordered it. The sound quality is very crisp. I'll order more for friends!!
1,it doethe job
1,Fit perfectly
1,This totally protects the screen on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4.
1,Good sound.
1,Works great!
1,it is great
1,I bought one and was pleased with the product quality. I just ordered two more for other family members.
1,Right size<br />Not too bulky
1,"I love this case,is really useful and really good quality, it's been 6 months and still working like day one I definitely recommend this product."
1,Love this car charger! My favorite part is that I can charge my phone while someone else who is in my car can as well. It also charges my iPhone 5c very quickly which I love in case of an emergency. Would buy another!
1,"I love the case. It came on time and came with a screen protector and small stylus, which was a great surprise. Only reason I cant give it 5 stars is because you can only put some muc b cash and cards in it. I can only handle like 4 cards with little cash. But all in all a good buy"
1,Good!
1,There awesome and people if the pen can Work on your photo me is good and it's even better for the price!!
1,Perfect fit for my iPhone 4...totally fixed my power connection and detection (when the software disable the speakers because it falsely detects being docked).
0,Good phone but not for people that are not tech savvy
-1,It works mostly but doesn't connect to the Garmin app and sometimes it just quits tracking you. Also stops if you don't move over a large area. Get something else.
0,"I bought these in August and at $20 I wasn't expecting much, but they were great. Two days ago they started cutting in and out, the left ear  crackles, gets quiet, stops working, headphones disconnect, reconnect, work for a bit, repeat. Sometimes it turns off without telling me and I just lose all sound instantly. The longest these go without crackling now is about 10--20 minutes"
1,"Love it, good fingerprint access and buttons work correctly."
1,"I've had this phone for a couple months now, it's a serious upgrade to my first gen iphone that I was using but my only problems with this phone is that after only about 1 month my screen cracked at the bottom it was never dropped or set down hard it was unexplained I just woke up one morning and there was a crack its nothing major. The other problem was the audio speaker went out also the battery life is not good but I use Wi-Fi I heard that's why. All in all I really love this phone so far I am very happy I bought it and no contract!! You can't beat that for the price of this phone. Its really fast too."
0,Nice device but mine did not come with directions so I have no idea if I'm using it correctly hence the 3 stars. But that light feature is awesome!!
1,Good product
-1,Good thing it was so cheap.
-1,Couldn't get bubbles out.  Cracked when I tried to lift and re-postion.
1,"What a great little recorder! Video quality is great. It's funny that I get a note to review this device only a few days after I witness a traffic accident where both drivers claimed &#34;the light was green&#34;. My recorder captured the entire event and provided proof of liability for the driver that ran the traffic light. The only issue that I have is that the &#34;emergency&#34; mode recording is triggered extremely easily (perhaps by going over a speed bump with anything buy extreme care). Setting the sensitivity to low (or even high) makes no difference. The bracket provided, while fine for most applications, did not have the range of motion needed for my car and where I needed to mount it. I had to hack up the bracket and cobble in some plastic pieces to fit the camera in front of the rear-view mirror where it would not interfere with my vision.<br /><br />Otherwise a great, inexpensive product that I highly recommend."
0,"I use this to play music from my phone in my truck.<br /><br />Works as advertised except for 2 problems:<br /><br />1)There is a buzzing noise through the radio when no music is playing from my phone.  It goes away when music is playing and then it actually sounds darn good.  I tried a ground loop isoltator like others have recommended.  It did remove the noise, but also degraded the sound quality, so I'd rather just deal with the buzzing during the rare times no music is playing.<br /><br />2) The unit does automatically connect to my phone when I start up the truck, but, for some reason the music plays through my phone speaker instead of this bluetooth unit unless I disconnect and reconnect the bluetooth, every time.  I have 5 other bluetooth systems around that are no problem - if I play music while connected, they just work, but this one is the only one that doesn't automatically play nice with my phone."
1,allows for cool photos
1,"Really good fit on the phone, but sometimes the rubber doesn't grab the plastic edge. Otherwise excellent and good prtection for the device."
1,Great Product!!! fast Shipping!!
1,This wireless charger works great for the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. All you will need is a wall adapter plug and you are good to go. Make sure to place the disc in the center of the phone to work properly. The screen will show a blue ring with a battery percentage in the center  that indicates it's charging. It is only a little over 2.5 inches so it will not take much space. For the price it is a great deal.
1,It is functional and protect my kid's iPhone well very. I like the wallet feature. The case is not as tight-fitting as I like.
-1,"Disappointed with this product.  I purchased this to use with my Samsung S4 and was hoping that I could just plug it in and take photos, but no, I had to download the Camera360 app.  Once I downloaded the app, I was able to take photos, but noticed that this stick is tempermental - sometimes a light touch takes a photo, and other times I am repeatedly holding down the button and nothing happens.  Also, after having taken a  few photos, I thought that they would automatically be saved to my phone gallery, not so with the camera360 app. Once you take a photo with this stick you have to actually save it manually to your phone gallery.  I also tried this stick with my S5 and it didn't work, and I didn't want to download the camera app. Overall, would not recommend."
1,l like its so cool
-1,These cords are junk. Most of them stopped working within the same day!!! I had 1 cord last a week....
1,Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
1,Good!
1,"The case does just what is says it will do.  I use it all the time when outdoors gardening and boating. I can operate the iPhone very well while it is inside the case and even take and make phone calls. It isn't water resistant when you're wearing headphones because the headphone cord keeps you from closing the seal tight.  My one reservation is the lanyard. I like it because my iPhone doesn't fall out of my pocket when I bend down. However the phone swings around on the lanyard and get's in the way. I have to tuck the phone into my belt or pin the lanyard to my shirt to keep the phone from swinging around on the lanyard.  I recommend this product, especially for people who spend a lot of time outside."
1,I love this cable. It's exactly what I needed for my desk at work!
-1,It doesn't cover the edges of my phone that well and cased my phone screen to get cracked
-1,"This case is beautiful, however it has a snap closure that you need to press down hard against the glass of the phone to close. Not a good design.  If it were a magnetic closure, I would have given this 4 stars, but it's not worth it."
1,"It fits perfectly on my Note 4, and it's  easy to slip on and take off. It feels sturdy and durable. Very satisfied."
1,"I love that I can get these so cheap and have simple, secure mounts for my device on all of my human powered vehicles."
1,Appears to be a great case.  Hard plastic with rubber edging.  Also like the screen protector that is included.  Have no problems using the touch screen with it.  I just wish the colors wouldn't have been more pastel.  There was a  darker purple one from someone else I liked better but didn't have the touch screen protector this one did.  So white is a good substitute.
1,Works well
0,seems small and did not separate with the application tabs well.  it seems strong but just a little too small for the DS.
1,"Fantastic product.  Luckily I haven't had a chance to test it for impact protection, but love how the coating keeps fingerprints way down.  Bought another screen protector for a different phone I bought for another family member at the same time, it does nowhere near as good a job."
-1,Very quit speakers
1,Does what it says it does! Not light on it but its no problem.. im happy with it.
1,"Excellent holster for such a low price. When my wife lost her holster I expected a Blackberry-branded replacement to cost much more. This one is just fine--sturdy and serviceable. Highly recommended for a name brand, sturdy functional replacement holster."
1,"Just received mine. The build quality is excellent. You have 2 options to secure a piece of ferromagnetic metal to your phone, a small disk or a rectangle that is thinner and smaller than a credit card. These can be attached with peel and stick adhesive or placed between your phone and your case. I chose the latter, since I have a simple Belkin case on my iPhone. The device fits securely into my air vent, and the magnetic force is adequate. No problems to report."
1,Is what they say
-1,I was excited when I received it but after a few days and my little girl grabbed and dropped it the case chipped on the side. I thought it was durable. I am disappointed.
1,Fit my Samsung Galaxy S4 perfectly. Comfortable and soft.
1,"Had an excellent transaction with vendor. Item exactly as described. But, on to the actual case itself. It's a very snug fit, all the buttons and holes are perfectly aligned. Within minutes of putting the case on for my wife, she dropped the phone on our hardwood kitchen floor, not a scratch or even a mark. The only thing is the lack of directions, which should definitely be looked up before putting on the screen protector.<br />I was never a fan of 2 piece cases, but this one looks nice, has done a great job protecting the phone so far, and was an excellent value.<br />When I upgrade my phone(or my wife's), this is the first place I'll look for a case for it."
1,Ad advertised
1,Works great!
1,"This is it. Stop looking I read all the reviews and bought about 10 diffrent kind. When I clicked yes I accidentally hit the wrong size. The seller corrected my mistake no problem! These are perfect allot of the rubber cases attract hair and dust, these have a great finish. Allot of watch cases don't fit the buttons the right way or block the crown, these line up perfectly. Bonus is the charger cable holder! This deal is amazing!"
1,"Rugged cable, good quality. Didn't help my cell as my power jack is bad but worked perfectly on other usb items! Amazons price was a third of the truck stop price and half of other stores for this same item. I will buy one for every charger I have."
-1,"The first one lasted me about 9 months before the door on the back cracked off, not too bad for $15. However the latest one is less than two months old and has already failed. No thanks."
1,Everything went perfectly fine
1,"After receiving a replacement for a defective part,  it works perfect! Great quality and fantastic customer attentiveness."
1,"I love this product. It charges itself quickly and charges my phone faster than plugging it into the laptop or wall. The battery also lasts a long time for me. I traveled on and off the last month to 3 different locations and this definitely came in handy to charge my phone when I was out and about. It fit easily in my bag and has enough power to charge my phone through multiple charges. I was even able to offer my friends' phones some juice because of how well this held up. I highly recommend this product, it was worth the price for me!"
1,Works great at a reasonable price
1,Very easy to put on camera!  Love it!
-1,"No instructions, and it didn't stick correctly."
1,"I was a bit skeptical about how cool the virtual reality headsets would be. I thought there's no way they can be as fun and amazing as people claim. That was, until I got these in the mail! I downloaded a few apps, a Rollercoaster simulator, a couple mazes, and of course being me and the zombie fanatic I am, zombie shooter ones. As the person using them they are amazing. ALL you see is what's on the screen and it really does feel like you're there. This set blocks out all excess light and fits a variety of heads! My husband is even more skeptical on EVERYTHING than I am and even he enjoyed it! My boys didn't want to give my phone back after they tested it out but this mama needed it... so she could keep playing with the VR herself lol. The controller was very easy to connect to my phone and came with the batteries needed for it which was great because we don't typically have AAAs lying around the house. If you are in the market for a great VR headaet, these are AMAZING!<br /><br />Side note, my best friend and coworker lived these too, he walked around with the headset on and open for like 10 minutes before he even got to try the apps out. We both thought it was hilarious that he looks like the guy from trailer park boys with the cats lol. There is an included image of that!.<br /><br />I got these at a discount for my honest review!"
1,"This is a awesome deal!! I was able to use the car charger to plug in a mini speaker, my cell phone and a mp3 player, all at the same time! My car radio went out and i love my music, but I didn't want to run down my device batteries, so i plugged them in and it was great! Also, this is a KIT, it comes with a hands free set up too, all i had to do was stick the metal piece to my cell and attach the magnet to a car vent. It was that easy! So now, I can enjoy hands free cell calls, and listen to my favorite music or charge my devices, all at the same time! Love it!!"
-1,Takes way too long to charge.  It takes about 5 and a half without the phone in it.
1,We use it at work to connect Ipad to TV.  It works absolutely great.  We had to use it last week for a meeting.
1,our kids love this product. no more dead phones
1,"so i ordered this case because fall out boy is my favorite band. it actually came in the mail sooner than the expected delivery date said, which is a  big plus. didnt have a problem putting the case on my phone which is  a samsung galaxy S3. the only problem with it which is really minor, if you put the case on, it stays on, and i mean  its sorta hard to get off. but other than that its awesome. great quality. would recommend!"
1,Very sturdy and hold my iphone 6 in place. Great product.
-1,"My first thoughts was that this case is great, until the lock that keeps it shut snapped off.. Haven't even had it for a week yet.... The worst part is that I read all the reviews before I bought it and knew other people had this problem, but I still bought it anyway...."
-1,"These sounds great but have some serious UX and quality flaws. the inner lining of the earphones is only GLUED, not stitched... so it recently started to tear away from the foam padding. Really not ok. Has seriously affected the functionality.  :(  :("
1,My GPS can't fit in it if connected to the power.
1,Loved this case worked beautifully underwater ordered it specifically for a trip to the Dominican Republic and I'm so happy I got it!!!!
1,Easy to install works as described with my iphone 6 don't have to take the phone out of its protective case either.  Easy to mount.  No complaints here!
1,"It looks very nice, protects mobile when falling. One single drawback is that these drawings of butterflies start to disappear a little at a time."
1,"Works well.  This is a replacement for an old cover that was placed in dryer by mistake (heat melts an inner liner).  The seat does slide as I enter and exit the car, that is my only complaint.  There is another model that is advertised as non-slip but I didn't purchase it.  I had my last one for over 10 years with no problems."
1,"Installed this last night. Followed a video on youtube and the install went perfectly. Screen looks like the original screen, from the LG logo and finish on the grey area at the bottom all the way to the perfect fit of the glass. If I didn't replace it myself I would think its the stock screen. The digitizer had no dead spots and seems to be very responsive. Screen looks clear and bright, I can't tell any difference in quality from the original. As long as it keeps working long term I will be very happy with this  purchase.<br /><br />Tools included were great, suction cup worked and made the job much easier, pry tool and guitar pick tool worked great. Only tiny complaint was that the screw driver end seemed too small, felt like it was going to strip the screws out, so I went and got a better quality little bit wider screw driver from my tool box and it worked great."
1,Great product. Sturdy and shock resistant at the same time.
1,This was on my 2014 Christmas list and Santa didn't come :^( but it was in the high 100's at the time. Around $50 this is an absolute steal.<br /><br />I bought this to use on my boat as the radio was in it's last stages. Using the Deck unit with connection to my cellphone was phenominal to say the least. We put the unit on the dash or wherever. The sound was very good and loud enough to hear behind the boat up to 20 feet with intesity and clarity. Everyone was impressed that you could get this much quality sound out of such a small unit. I ran my DECK all afternoon from 12pm - 6pm continuously with no issues.<br /><br />Being able to now drive our listening from songs loaded to my Android phone or via streaming on Rhapsody was over-the-top. I can't say enough for how well this performs (at least in my application).
-1,Stopped working on day 45. Amazon says its ineligible for return. Pretty disappointed!
1,love this
1,love these things
1,Out of all the NFC tags you get with offer the key chain one is the one I use the most because it is so portable they stick well and are great in high it like in my car in the hot florida sun.
1,Great phone case!! Very unique and attractive. Exactly what I was looking for. Beautiful design.
1,no issues
1,We love these! They last a long time!
1,"This does a great job at holding your device your way.  I chose dashboard mounted and took the advice of other reviews and used the supplied  little disk as a base. The method it uses to lock and unlock the device from its &#34;claw&#34; is outstanding. It's a little ugly, but who isn't!"
1,"I like the case. It is not as big as the otter box, which has some disadvantages, but it also has advantages. The biggest problem I hav is probably not the case manufacturers problem. The iPhone chargers fit perfect, but other chargers may not fit through the charger hole in the case."
1,It's a really great cd  player. The one thing is it makes the cds  really really hot. But other than that it works well and is a great cd player. It's easy to install and we'll worth the money
0,"This battery pack appeared to work fairly well at first.  It was capable of charging iPhone 6 Plus.  But after using it a few times, the LED light stopped being able to turn off.  The battery pack still works, but it probably won't hold a charge for weeks since the LED light drains the battery."
1,This is the best portable charger I have ever used. It charged my galaxy s5 4 times and my galaxy s4 once all in one charge. It has been great!
-1,"Dose not work, waste<br />Of money"
0,"The piece where the wires attach can be an issue in tight space applications, such as motorcycle fairings. The center-mounted tweeters rotate 180 degrees for directional purposes. There is also a button/switch on the tweeter, but I'm not 100% sure of its purpose. The instructions provided are minimal at best. Better instructions would have resulted in at least one more star for this review."
1,"I've been using this lightning cable at work for the last week and love it. I sit in a cubicle and am always trying to keep my surface area clean. The design of this flat cable allows me to run the cable up the back wall and easily clip it into place to keep it organized. The cable works perfectly for charging your iphone and ipad. Quality is very good, I highly recommend it."
1,This is perfect and fits the Note 4 without shutting off or adjusting volume. The switch works perfectly and it fits great.
1,love it
1,Thank you!
-1,stopped working after few days  horrible......
0,"Quality is good, but it has sharp edges and very uncomfortable to hold. I will return it. I wish they fix this flaw."
1,"Works flawlessly, very satisfied with this product! I was skeptical to purchase after the nightmare the old school FM transmitters were, not any more... the iClever proves that it can be done right... if you are on the fence I strongly encourage you to make the purchase, great gadget at an awesome price!"
-1,Only 3 months of use and it is already falling apart. I'm convinced there is no good lightning cables out there.
1,"I have had this holster for about a month now, and it is holding up extremely well. It appears to be very rugged and well constructed. It is also very versatile, because it can be attached to a belt in a variety of ways. As shown in the pictures, it has a heavy duty metal clip which will allows it to attach vertically to a belt, but it also has provisions to allow a belt to looped through the holster either vertically or horizontally, eliminating the possibility of becoming unhooked from the belt. It also comes with a &#34;D&#34; ring to enable a 4th way to attach the holster to a backpack or whatever. It holds my BLU 6.0 phone perfectly and securely. I would highly recommend this quality product for those of us who do not put our phones in our pockets."
0,Ok case. The giraffe emblem seems like it will pick off easily bc its just coated on top of the silicon case. Great value though!
1,Works good and its worth $25
1,Yes it did thank you
1,Great product!!!  The range is excellent.  I have walked up to 45 feet from the receiver and it was still linked.  Sound quality is very good.  Does not get interference/humming noises like I saw in other reviews when in use and on the charger at the same time.
0,Plastic already snapped :-(
-1,"It’s not smooth, I feel sticky while swiping. Need to buy another."
1,"Outstanding Cable! It is absolutely worth spending the extra money to get a genuine FTDI Cable, Works flawlessly !!!"
1,Workes awesome
1,Reliable
0,Makes thumping noise every now and then when radio is on
1,"I suffer from dying electronics quite often. I use this as a backup in case I need it. It's saved me quite a bit of hassle keeping my Samsung tablet from dying  (if you own an andriod, you know the battery life goes quick). The size is small, but it holds a lot of charge. It can charge my tablet to 100% while using it. I'm sure it has plenty of juice left to charge my phone (also an android, but never use it) since it charges quick and is very small, I can take it to concerts to save my camera from losing charge... its a high quality product and built well. green is my favorite color too so the Bytech battery pack wins! I received this at a promotional price in exchange for an honest review"
0,Not waterproof....at all
1,Picture resolution is awesome.
1,It doesn't slip and slide around when I start sweating.
-1,"They didn't fit in my phone, and would not seal the port."
1,Good durable phone cases and in a timely manner
-1,Not worth it. The mic is too heavy that it pulls out the other side.
1,"Not the best case, but one of the few that fits the wireless charging back cover for the S5. It fits quite well and the material seems decent enough."
1,Love it
1,Fits well.
1,"****READ THIS***** The latest android update has caused a lot of the apps previously used to connect your watch to your phone unusable. I was FINALLY able to get this watch to work in full capacity after downloading an app called (SmartWear) in the google play store. The current icon used looks like a black square with a white border and thin blue line representing the hands of a clock. Yes I have the latest version of Android as of 9-2-2015 and this is the only app that has worked for me afeter trying like 7 apps before.  (Make sure to do the following instructions immediately back to back. If one disconnects while the other is connecting go back and try to reconnect meaning if the bluetooth fails to connect while Smartwear is attemptingto connect go back to the bluetooth and attempt to pair again keeping both programs attempting to connect simultaneously.  It may take a few tries more or less but it will eventually connect fully.  To connect the watch using SmartWear app: run the app asking it to search for the watch (WHILE ITS SEARCHING/connecting), then go into the bluetooth settings ON YOUR PHONE then do a scan. You should see the option (Smart Watch) choose it. Once connected go into your phones setting for that connection and choose to connect the call audio and media audio. Once these options are selected my phone allows the SmartWear app to fully connect to my watch.  I will do my best to respond to any comments. Good luck!!"
1,Update: died and unfroze and still very impressive.  This is is really cool for the price but cheap. I have had it for three days and not it has froze. I'm gonna return if it doesn't work once it dies.
1,Good product
-1,"After about 2 years, the battery life on my i5 was down to about 4 hours of typical use, so I figured I would get a new battery.  The highest rated battery with tool kit on Amazon would not ship to my location outside of the &#34;48&#34;, so I went with another seller's product.  The tools are fairly low quality and I broke one of the plastic pry tools during first use.  The other, smaller tool was able to get the job done (there are 4 different plastic pry tools in the kit; 2 guitar picks and 2 chisel-like tools).  The replacement of the battery was quite simple with the only challenge getting the separation of the screen from the back case a bit of a challenge (look up YT videos on the process and be slow, gentle, and patient).  The reason for 2 stars is due to the tools being &#34;functional&#34; for the task.<br /><br />If it weren't for the tools, this would be a 1-star review as the battery itself has proven to be essentially worthless.  It is identical to my original battery in all markings except one: It's old.  Very old.  the original battery in my phone has a manufacture date in 2013.  The &#34;new&#34; battery I received with this order has a manufacture date of 2012, so it has been sitting on a shelf for 3 years.  I've had the battery in the phone for several days now and run it through several charge/discharge cycles to be sure, but I can't get the &#34;new&#34; battery to run my phone for more than about 3 hours.  I'll be popping my phone back open and putting my original battery back in so I can get at least 4 hours and then looking for yet another battery source to see if I can find a newer battery that will function at near original capacity levels.  At least I have the tools now, so I can search for just the battery."
-1,The worst wasn't even the case I wanted it was a Fake imitation case of Kate spade and was very  piss about it
1,"Great, loved it. Perfect for my car."
0,had some discoloring under the flap
1,"I got this for my wife when Amazon had it on sale.  I read a lot of bad reviews for many bluetooth hands-free car kits over the last couple months.  This one caught my eye because although there were only a few reviews, they were favorable overall.  I decided to give it a try considering the low price and considering the great Amazon return policy.  I installed this for my wife and routed the cables out of the way.  I paired it with her new iPhone and showed her how to control the unit.  She is a happy camper.  She is far from tech savy but she has no problem remembering and operating the simple controls.  The audio quality of the microphone isn't as great as my factory system but it really is good quality -especially considering the low cost.  The audio quality for streaming music from her phone is great and that is how the unit is used 99% of the time.<br /><br />We don't use the cigarette ligher USB adapter portion of the kit because I already bought her one that is much better quality.  That said, the one included with this kit seems to be good quality and that was a surprise.  She keeps it as a spare -just in case.  We are very happy with this unit and I am considering getting one myself.  My factory hands-free unit only supports calls over bluetooth and I want one of these to handle music streaming."
1,I am extremely pleased with this charger for the ease of use...no special spots to find.  What I love is the price.  This is far less expensive  than the phone store prices...now I can have upstairs/downstairs units.  The price is great for students and retirees.
-1,Touch screen is very poor. It respond too late and need to press hard. Not a good phone to have.
1,Just what I needed. Offers great flexibility for mounting GPS.
1,It's simple and easy to use.
-1,Very slow reaction. I do not like it
1,love it
1,Perfect for the upgrade I needed.
1,Great price for this size charger. Works fine.
1,"Delivered May 3, 2015 It does the job. (I still have it)  I have to admit my boss does not see a thing! (replace Boss to whoever you're trying to hide the screen from) but in reality i love this thing.  I kid you not!! my coworkers complain that they can't see when i'm trying to show them &#34;instagram&#34; pics.  They actually have to hold the phone in order to see what i'm trying to show them.  Caveat!!! when taking a picture high or low you won't see the screen which is a bummer but I can live with that and It's not why i got it in the first place."
-1,I've had no luck programing this unit at all. at one point I was able to transmit but now it will not transmit and in dual channel mode it emits a constant beeping noise.
1,EXCELLENT SERVICE GREAT
1,My son loved it! The only bad thing about it is that the battery runs out too fast.
-1,Not good at all.
0,"This worked perfectly for the phone , the only issues is the plastic. The plastic surrounding this chipped off very easily revealing a  shiny black plastic instead of a matte plastic . The Stylus was junk in fact a dollar store stylus lasted longer than this ."
-1,Tracker has quit working after 1.5 months.
1,"The case, while slightly pricey, does fit perfectly and is really good protection for the Go!"
1,good protection of the  phone but looks like it does not exist
-1,"Often the detector doesn't go off when you think it should (when you come into contact with patrols on the freeway). I drive by an airport every day and the detector doesn't go off until it is right next to the radar, seems like it would recognize it further out especially such a strong signal. Regardless, ran up on a radar gun today (on opposite side of freeway) and the detector never alerted me. Again seems like it would have triggered an alert. My friends had one over 15 years ago that seemed to work better. For reference the detector was mounted level at the highest point on my windshield. Albeit I have limited experience with radar detectors.  You need confidence in a detector and I don't have any in this model."
1,Thank you
1,This was everything I was hoping for. Reviews of various products were kind of iffy and I was worried that this might be a dud...but it turned out to be a winner. I have no hesitation in recommending it.
1,Loved it
-1,Fair.. Not as good as I thought it would be..
1,good
1,"Really nice case, sturdy and functional"
1,great
1,"I really love the look of this case it is slim and smooth, I do worry about losing the gold piece especially on this phone since the pieces are so thin, but so far the case has held its own quite well. Very happy to have been able to sample this case, would recommend."
0,Super cute. Fits in my back pocket perfect though the material is PVC tends to crack easy. But love the design
1,It suited our purposes perfectly
1,Fits my phone perfectly. Soft and keeps my phone protected
1,"Awesome case! Bought this as a back up case, but I already use it more than the main case. The colors are fabulous, very sharp looking, and it doesnt come loose at the corners, so I don't play with it and ruin it like so many other cases I've bought.<br /><br />For tactile people the waves on the back are superfun to run your hands over. I don't normally like gild, but this is soft and offsets the blue bery nicely"
1,very useful
-1,"I got mine in the mail the other day ,and the day after it had already started to break down. The &#34;ink&#34; in the front came off very easy."
1,Things kick ass recommend an amp 100%
1,Love it.
1,"Use this for my Note 5. Charges at a good rate, works great."
1,"Haven't use this case yet, but I have it in another color....and they are awesome!  Very well made and sturdy!"
-1,"Phone looks and works great, unfortunately it wasn't NEW.....numbers in the call log and pictures in the phone gallery when received . Very disappointed!"
0,It was not what I expected. I return the item.
0,"It is coming apart and it is made of cardboard!  Also, the sparkles get all over your hands."
1,Its fine
1,same as original that comes with phones.. very fast charging
1,"Very protective, I've dropped my phone countless time and not even a scratch yet! These cases work great for my family and you can't beat the price!"
1,One of the best cases.  I can put all my cards in it and it doesn't scratch my phone.  It is soft and not too big. I would definitely order it again.  Was sent to me so fast!
-1,didn't last very long
1,"I've been looking for a backup battery for my Samsung Galaxy Ace Style S765C for a year. The others I looked at had mixed reviews - they fit for some people and not others, so I didn't purchase. I tried this one and haven't had any problems with it. I'm happy to let all searching Ace Style S765C owners know that this battery will fit your phone! I'm so happy to finally have a backup, it's one worry off my mind. Thank you AceSoft!"
1,"Easy installation, and it will charge all my devices at the same time."
1,Very good!
1,It is a nice color of black and my husband likes how it feels in his hand.
0,The frame to hold the phone broke a week after I receive my purchase.
1,Nice size
1,I love the product as it described.  Protect my phone real good.
1,Great cable i use one for my desk setup and it bends and holds it shape well have had it for a long time and it hasn't broken at all and i am really happy with the build quality of this product i would never buy a cheap cable again these cables are the best.
-1,Believed it to be for IPhone 6 but actually for IPhone4
0,You get what you pay for
-1,ripoff
-1,"The LG G fits works very well and I am very well pleased.<br />The only thing was I do not think the account was not wright when I got visa bill.<br />I would like somebody check and make it wright . This whole think started because I had to return the first one , not the one."
0,Have bought about 6 units<br />Charges very fast<br />THE Last ONE burned OUT
1,Good price for a great items.
1,It worked good
1,"The belt clip broke but I was able to repair it, for the price you cannot go wrong. It definitely exceeded my expectations. I purchased a black for myself and a purple for My Wife, we are both very pleased."
1,GREAT HEADPHONES!!! Honestly.
1,Love this cable. It's really well made and super sturdy. Way better than the one that came with the phone.
-1,"does not hold a charge very long; operates pretty standard; okay for the price. music sound quality good, but mic for phone is horrible. couldn't use as phone headset. stopped working after about 3 months. they still connect but absolutely no sound!!!"
1,Great product. Quick service.
-1,"Screws fall out if not tightened every other day, rubber is cheap, and absolutely huge and impractical."
1,Great screen protector.
-1,The joysticks don't work properly. They have a dead spot and the timing is off!
1,Great product at discount price. Seller delivered as listed.
1,A good solid cable.
1,"Having used this for 2 yrs and this is the2nd one purchased, never disappoint with Apple products"
1,Great replacement battery.  I purchased two of these.  I always place the date I purchased them.  The price was good and the delivery was on time.
1,"Super cute, all the buttons are easy to use and the charger and earphones holes work perfectly. It fits perfect with my glass screen protector. The case goes over the sides for more protection and hugs my iPhone 5s tightly."
-1,After a month the suction spring stop working which for a $65 dock is unacceptable .
1,"I LOVE this tiny little speaker! It is so adorable and the sound is incredible for a speaker of its size. I use it in my office and at home when I cook, and you would never guess how small it is. It is so easy to take with me on vacation. Another plus is that it connects very easily through bluetooth to my phone and computer. (It is much easier to connect than other/larger speakers I have had.)"
1,"Great Product. Everything you need to install is in the package as well as extra screen protectors. I've had mine for a few months and not a scratch on it. They send an email with instructions, which is very helpful also. I really like that it's perfectly made for my iPhone and it hasn't started to peel. Works great!"
1,So perfect...!!!
1,Love this speaker. Loud and clarity is unmatchable. The company stands by their product and wants you to be 100% satisfied and I am. Thanks for everything.
1,Working nicely so far!  Good buy.
1,"We bought this for our daughter's phone, its a good solid strong case that will protect the phone."
-1,"I was looking for a good, cheap screen protector and with all these 4-5 star reviews i thought this was the perfect screen protector but boy as i wrong, i was very upset with the way it handled my first drop! The screen didnt do anything at all but only make my real screen crack even more! It is partially my fault but it is also very false advertising, when they say it can withstand high impact drops it cant even withstand 1 meter drop. So what do they really mean high impact drops? Next time i will for sure be doing a little more research on products such as screen protectors. With that aside there were no little bumps/air pockets when you put your screen on."
1,Dropped many times already and not a scratch on it
-1,I'm really bummed about this adapter. I was so exited to get it after reading all the good reviews. I've only been using it for 2 weeks and it's already giving out on me. I've had others that have lasted well over 6 months so am a bit disappointed. Wouldn't recommend this unless mine was just a dud. Maybe that's the case?
1,"Nice and clear, easy to apply, smooth to the touch. Very happy with this product. You peel one side, apply to phone, and then peel off the second protective film. These are the type I find work the best."
1,"Great phone. I've had this thing for about a week and so far so good. My previous phone was a Galaxy S3 but it was 3 years old and lagged a ton. I'm a casual user and mainly use my phone for social media, texting, and the occasional photo/video if I am out or on vacation.<br />The screen is bright but it's not as bright as a Samsung Galaxy. It's also huge and does hog the battery. I'm not a heavy media user so the battery life is fine with me but if you are constantly on your phone and watching youtube etc I'm sure this won't be the device for you. Under heavy use, you'll probably only get 10 hours on one charge if you're lucky. I get about 24 hours between standby and social media use. Some have commented that you can't see the screen in the sun but I see it just fine on the &#34;auto&#34; setting.<br /><br />The phone does get pretty hot if you're playing games or doing things that stress out the processor. GPS use will definitely heat up this phone and there is an overheating warning for if you up the brightness while the phone is hot. It hasn't just plain shut off on me so the heat isn't really a bother.<br /><br />Camera is nice. Works really well in well lit areas. In low light, it does drop in quality but not bad.<br /><br />Other than that. I'm enjoying this phone a lot. It doesn't lag or anything and is running just fine and a worthy upgrade. I can do everything I did on my S3 but without the lag. :) If you are a casual user and want an affordable phone that works well, this is a good option."
-1,The Worst thing I've ever purchased. Did not fit my phone at all. Entirely too small and not properly aligned i have a Galexy 6edge and couldn't use the edge featured with the cover
1,love these
0,"the purse is extremly large, wish I could detach and have only the shoe."
1,The color of the case is as exactly how it appears online. I love it!
1,"I just got this in the mail today so far I love it, it holds my cell phone up perfectly for viewing for GPS in my car or a movie on my night stand.  Will probably be buying another or maybe a couple more."
1,item as described and arrive on time
1,Exactly what I needed.
1,As described. Very easy to apply. Fast shipping.
1,This S6 Edge charger case works good. I would recommend this case. It does take a little longer to charge then I thought it would but most phones charge faster when directly connected to there own charger. I did receive delivery more the two weeks before they said it would be delivered.
1,Good protection except no rubber around edges.
1,I use this while out on my kayak and it works great for my phone.  I am able to take pictures without the fear of my phone getting wet or falling in the lake.  Keeps my phone nice and dry.
0,"the plastic loop where the arm band strap goes thru, flips .. making it un-comfortable and painful to wear.  I have found that using this around my wrist works well.  It is not tight, nor painful.  I love the large pockets, fits an S5, keys too."
-1,"If you are planning on using this cord with an Otterbox Case, it won't work."
1,Prefect:)!
1,This product works great.  We have two IPhones and two IPads hooked up to this where we sit.  It works great and I highly recommend it.  The company did a great job packaging it and getting it to me on time.  I probably will order another one for the bedroom.
0,Grate cause if your saving up for a otterbox
0,I was disappointed it didn't have a remote on the stick but it works
1,I absolutely love this case!! Shows your whole iPhone while protecting it!! Best case ever!!
1,I take this with me every time I go to the beach and it works Amazingly!! NOT a single drop reaches my phone
1,Excellent product.
1,Great ham for starters settings can be a hassle but well worth the price!
-1,It broke the second day
1,Bulky but so cute!
-1,Poory made.
1,"fast shipment, great quality for the price."
0,Works in the Phone but doesn't perform any better than my 3-year old batterie. They probably sat on the shelf for 3 years waiting for me... :-(
1,&iexcl;Muchas gracias!
1,"I was in NYC and needed gps and apps to get around, borrowed a friends Anker to keep iPhone charged. I was impressed with the Anker and ordered my own when I got home. Great product, good value."
1,"loved it, but didn't fit"
1,"Out of a group of about 10 cases for iPhone 6 Plus, I think this is the best one all around.<br /><br />It's extremely similar to Ballistic's clear case (which I love), but is slimmer, uses a differently tinted plastic, and has a different design on back.<br /><br />This has a great feel to it that is slick, yet has grip when needed. It is not bulky at all and slim. It has the air cushions on the corners for great drop protection. Cut-outs and button alignment are good.  I like the line design on the back.<br /><br />You really can't beat this case so far."
1,"Love the ability to change wristband colors to coordinate with my workout outfits. However, the clasps require a bit of work to make sure do they stay fastened."
1,had a little snag activating the phone . After a US based person got on line they activated the phone and it works great.
1,This is my second one.  Excellent product. Great service !!
0,good
1,"Excellent battery. Definitely purchase a 2 amp wall charger to juice this thing up quickly. The piano finish gets a lot of flack but I prefer it over the new PowerCore's matte finish. The PowerCore will slide right out of your hand, whereas the E5's finish is grippy. An added benefit to this over the PowerCore 15,600 is that this one is shorter lengthwise but has a slightly higher capacity. I can deal with 3 amp output vs 4.8 amps for the PowerCore."
1,After looking for a good small portable speaker I decided on this one. All the reviews sounded great.  The speaker surpassed my expectation on both sound and battery life great product!
1,"Love it, love it,  love it!<br />Does everything i wanted it to do. .."
1,Every colorful and a great case to have. It also works.
1,Excellent.
1,Nice!!
1,Great product at an unbeatable price! Would buy again.
0,Cheap but it works.  &#34;Instructions&#34; are a joke.
1,Good price
1,I love love love this solar charger! The thing about smart phones is that they use a lot of battery power.
1,"Fits perfectly.  You don't have to struggle to fit your phone into the case - it slides right in.  Covers the volume keys which actually makes them easier to access.  It also keeps you from accidentally hitting the &#34;silence&#34; button.  Haven't dropped it yet so I don't know how well it protects from shock. This is my first iPhone and I wasn't going to get a case, but this actually makes it easier to handle."
1,great
1,"I just got it- was very easy to put on, no bubbles:-) Keeping my fingers crossed and hope to avoid a &#34;drop test&#34;! I also like their lifetime warranty promise."
1,Telling my friends how great this is.
1,Sound quality is great but battery life is short-about an hour and a half. Can hear my music over the sound of my riding lawnmower without having to turn the volume up all the way.
1,Great!
-1,"Did not work consistently, had to hold in place just to charge, then stopped working all together after 4 days,"
1,perfect fit for my blackberry and is not bulky
1,"As waterproof cases go, it does work. I put weight of phone, in coins in pouch with a tissue and dropped in bucket of water. floated and all stayed dry. CAUTION THOUGH: At first I just put in a bunch of coins and didn't weight and it sank, fast. So, be sure to try at least the weight of your phone, if it is heavier than mine, it might not work. Not the easiest to close and open, nothing fast about it, but I can take on boat without worrying about it getting splashed or falling over board. Not easy to take photos with though, so I usually end up taking out of pouch to take photos, which could defeat the purpose of even having it. If you ever attempted photos with your phone in the sun, especially with glare off the water...it is hard to see phone alone, and with the case on it is even harder. I purchased some waterproof camera floats and attached one to the loop on this case for extra safety about sinking. Does't matter how waterproof the case is if it sinks to the bottom of a lake.Despite it being a bit awkward, it still gives piece of mind and that makes it worth it."
1,I fits really good nice grip aand feel to it
1,Thanks. So. Much.  God bless.
1,👌👌👌
1,"lightweight, classy, perfect"
-1,"Sounded fine but not built very well, within 10 minutes the product wireing came loose and stopped working in one ear"
-1,this arrived defective - one of the channels was not working and created extremely loud feedback. by the time this was determined Amazon would not allow me to return it.
1,love it! i get compliments on it every day
1,"Works great, and my God, the awesome lights on it are so cool to see in the dark.! I mainly use it when I leave the house and know I'm not gonna be back home to charge my phone (for example, long out of state trips or a weekend out camping). I can certify and say that this thing can fully charge an iPhone (I have a 5S) 5 times and possibly even 6 times (I haven't tried). I recommend it.! It's very useful.!"
1,Amazing products!!
1,"Love this case! Very durable. If I had to say 1 bad thing about this case it is that the charger cover doesn't go in all the way and it gets in the way of charging your phone sometimes. Other than that, I have 2 children who still haven't managed to break my phone thanks to this case."
1,The unit worked fine and I got my 40 year old cassettes transferred to flash drive then to the computer.
1,Takes care of customers
-1,"This product did not work in the least.  I have little cell reception and placed the outdoor box in a clear area on top of the roof, but it did not improve my signal."
1,my father loves it
1,Just what I needed to fix my screen. I recommend this product for anyone that has a cracked screen for the Note 3.
1,"perfect fit, easy install, exactly like the stock one.  overpriced for what it is but whos gonna bother to send you anything for less than $5"
1,Great
1,shipped on time and fits
1,Love this light.  It fits perfectly and works great.
-1,"the tolerances for this are horrible, this is the cheapest life proof knock off i have ever seen<br />don't waste your time getting this"
1,Fits great
1,Excellent product!  Fast delivery!
1,adorable! i WANT MORE!
1,Great product. It's everything I expected and love it. Went on easy and effortlessly. 2-pack is great Price can't be beat. Highly recommend
1,"I'm not normally a review person...but I will say this is a wonderful case / wallet.  The phone case is very slim and looks professional, while the magnet that secures it into the 'wallet' portion of the case is very sturdy and keeps the phone in place well.  The best part, in my opinion, is the quality of the leather.  Thanks!"
1,Purchased as a gift - husband uses frequently!
0,Works well the only problem I have had is it will not work with my surface but it works with my phone perfectly that's why I gave it three stars. Still a good product though.
1,It works but it has to be under the sun while charging good for camping on sunny days
1,"This case is awesome! The kick stand is so handy, when feeding baby or when playing movies on the go. It is also durable and for someone who is clumsy, it has been great when dropped."
1,Works as well as original
-1,Loved the fit and the idea of a case but when I took it off there were little scratches where it had rubbed on the SS.
1,Great seller. Fast delivery. Product as described. Thank you!
1,Very comfortable to use while at the gym.
1,It is such a nice case.  It looks like a wallet.  I love it.  It is a pleasure to hold.
1,Works as advertised. Not too thick either which is good.
-1,"The package came at record time, very fast, I like the durable and color of this case, however it is too hard for me to press the buttons.  :("
1,"Came sooner than expected, and fit perfectly"
1,Works great does exactly what it is intended for.
-1,Nice look but has a short when I move
1,"Not perfect, but a phenomenal deal at the price."
1,I received everything as advertised.  Great deal!!!
1,Very nice looking
1,A+++ Product and seller
-1,"Love the design but it is off a little, doesn't &#34;hold&#34; the apple right. Also doesn't seem to fit the iPhone 6 correctly. Offers no protection, cover came off and phone broke after three days."
1,I love this phone
1,Great for the price and still working
1,"Our son likes to throw our phones on the floor.<br />With this case its safe and i don't worry about the phone breaking. The case is strong, I've even spilt liquids on the screen but the built-in screen protector works amazing!!!!"
1,Great product! Supports rapid charging on the Note 4.
1,"Very nice quality and fits the TomTom 5100 perfectly. I only wish it was half as thick though, as the unit has to be tucked into the pocket or equipment straps on one side, leaving the other side empty, or it will flop around. Good if you had a power cable or something to carry, but mine is fixed to the car mount."
1,greatcase
1,"Beautiful, plan to order another one."
1,Love it
1,The was a gift that the person recevied said was awesome.
-1,Doesn't actually charge
1,Very happy with my Anker external battery. First one came defective but Anker took care of it with great customer service and speedy delivery. Great product and I don't leave home without it. Bought one for the boyfriend and he loves it just as much. Highly recommend.
1,I never would have imagined that something like this would be this fun!  The cat especially loves it.  I run it all over the room and the cat chases it like crazy.  The AR part of the sphero is especially awesome!
-1,Stopped working after a little over a month of usage... Mainly used to Listen to music only... Manufacturer please contact me... Very unhappy since I can no longer output any volume out
1,Tried this out last weekend while in the mountains so I didn't have to run my generator just to charge a cell phone. Worked beautifully! Hooked my GoPro up to it along with my Samsung Galaxy S5 and had both charging immediately. Both devices were fully charged rather quickly.
1,I feel like this case met all my expectations. The bonus is that I've received so many compliments on how great it looks!  Very happy with my choice.
1,just as description stated. snug fit around phone. beautiful colors. MUCH cheaper than what I found in local stores.
0,"Fairly well constructed, but the ink cartridges were not very smooth on ink delivery, leaving a less than solid line of ink. I did manage to pop one of the tips off while in my pocket, but that may have been under rough conditions (sitting on the pen, for instance). Once I change the cartridges, I think I will be happier with these."
1,Does the job of protecting my phone.
1,"I love this case! It is super cute. I love that its clear plastic so that my white back can show through. I've gotten quite a few compliments on my phone since I've had the case. The bling is just the right amount. Its not crazy covered, but it gives that little accent. I think the thing I like most about it actually is how thin it is. I don't like when my phone is super heavy and thick after I put on a case. This adds almost no thickness to my phone. Please note that this case is mainly for decoration purposes, and serves almost no protection at all because it is all clear plastic all around and there is no rubber bumper anywhere to absorb shock if dropped or hit against anything. This is also just the back cover, and has nothing for the front screen. It is however a PERFECT fit. All the cut outs are exactly where they should be and everything lines up perfectly. I am usually very careful with my phone so I'm not worried about the protection. I just wanted something cute. Its very inexpensive, and I love it!<br /><br />(*I received this item in exchange for my honest review and opinion)"
1,Love It! 💯
1,Excellent product
1,works just fine in AT&T hot spot and a lot cheaper than most others want for the same thing with a different number. I'm not sure it will take or hold as large of a charge but it makes a wonderful backup when your on the road and you forgot or just didn't bring your charger.
1,Works good for wifes phone. No Problems.. :-)
1,This USB to Lightning cable is a nominal 1 m or about 39 1/2 in. long tip-to-tip.<br /><br />The cable is very resistant to tangling.  It has shiny white plastic casings and very pale grey soft plastic sheathing and strain relievers.<br /><br />It is compatible with Apple products and functions perfectly for data and power transfers both.<br /><br />NetSunDirect provided a cable for evaluation and review.
1,Love it
1,"Great screen protector, packaging a bit excessive."
1,"My iPhone5 has a new life! My screen had started coming off, and after an internet search I suspected that the battery was swelling. I thought I'd take a chance on this since it's way cheaper than getting a new phone or having this repaired.<br /><br />There were some bumps along the way. For example, I initially removed the screen without the frame around it. You have to lift up the frame as well in order to get to the battery. Unfortunately I broke part of the frame while trying to pry it open. Removing the battery was actually fairly easy despite what youtube videos suggested... I think the key is to pry it up from the left side just like the included instructions show.<br /><br />In the end I powered on the phone and it had about half a charge left, which is great. The whole phone snapped back together and looks pretty much good as new. The battery seems to do a decent job of holding charge. Overall, great experience, really cheap solution."
1,Item as described!
1,"I simply recommend this to ANY iPhone/iPod users out there who fix their iPhones/iPods.<br /><br />I have used this tool kit for my iPhone 4 and my iPhone 6+ and has been completely helpful the many times I have used this product. Whether it be installing a new screen to just simply taking out the SIM card, this tool kit has done justice for me."
1,"The iPod nano has gotten so tiny these days, I bought the arm band basically so I didn't drop the thing.  Good quality construction.  All I need in a band.  No complaints.  Came fast and free with Prime."
1,Great bang for youre buck
1,Very convenient product ! Charges two iPads two iPhones and 2  apple watches  quickly at the same time and still have another slot to charge something else and I have another outlet  ! Looks nice and  sleek ! Very happy and would definitely buy from these guys again ! Shipping was fast !
-1,Worked once and not too well.  Then nothing. Total waste of money
0,Poor sound quality.
1,I am very satisfied with Birugear 4Pcs Stylus/styli Touch Screen Pen.  I will recommend Birugear 4Pcs Stylus/styli Touch Screen Pen to anyone.  The pens are very good to work with.  I ordered a different name brand a few weeks ago which was cheaper - well you get what pay for.  The tips of the pens were so soft they were had to us.
1,"2 amp output has been helpful for charging USB battery packs while hiking in remote areas. It draws power even on slightly cloudy days, but you should charge a battery pack, not an iPhone directly. The iPhone will cut out as soon as the tiniest cloud crosses in front of the sun, and it will not resume charging until it is unplugged and reconnected. Charging directly to USB battery pack (Anker E5) resumes as soon as the sunlight returns without having to reconnect the wire."
1,"I was able to purchase this at a discount for an honest review.  I needed a charger at work that was as fast as my home charger.  This is just as fast, and it shows up on my phone as &#34;Fast Charging&#34;.  So, it is charging more than twice as fast as a regular charger.  This is key since I am always on the move, and can only charge for small periods at a time.  I am VERY happy with this charger set."
1,Has worked flawlessly for over year then i ended up droping it and breaking it again. for the price you cant beat it though! would of bought another but it was time to upgrade from the 3gs
0,The product works very well but the adaptor portion is too long if you are planning to use it on a motorcycle like I did. Unfortunately it will hit the tank if you are making a tight turn.
1,Had everything I needed
0,"I've tried to place this on my dashboard for at least.... 13 times and that's what happens:<br /><br />The mount holds for the whole night and when i get back there in the morning, to check it out ... i gotta see if the mount is either under my seat or somewhere else near the door it means ...this doesn't hold properly<br /><br />if you wanna place it on the mirror though, then it works GREAT<br />I have placed it on the mirror for over 3 weeks from now and so far it didn't fall"
1,"Excellent, great protect for the phone and looks elegant..."
1,great quality
-1,Don't waste your time. It's less than 60 days old and will not hold a charge.
1,My father loves the case it protect his phone .
1,This item got deliverd fast . and was the right part i have order parts befor and it was not at all what it said the description but this was not he case fast and the right part i am happy
0,It did leave a couple of air bubbles  other than that it's a good product
1,Firm and colorful. Great buy.
1,"***UPDATE 10.05.15*** Bought on 08.27.15, still working like brand new, great charger, fast and reliable. I don't know why I haven't bought sooner!  So far so good (1week in). I have my Bluetooth on, GPS, and Spotify on and this car charger gets ahead of the drainage. Like some chargers will either lose charge or just slowly hold that charge but never get ahead, this one works. I haven't used all four USBs at the same time yet, with my both my daughter's hungry tablets and the wife's iphone, but I will update when that's tested. But for right now, I'm never out of battery anymore while I'm traveling, which is great!"
1,good
1,Works better than the other 2 I've previously purchased. Holds the phone securely and is to adjust.
1,Came at a decent time. I was a little worried when I first received the box because it was all beat up and covered in tape with writing all over it but when I opened it up everything seemed fine and nothing looked damaged. The heads work great. A little bigger then what I was expecting but they sound good and also it pairs up with my phone without any problems. So overall it was a decent buy for the price.
1,love it.
1,Awesome case!!
1,"Initial reaction is &#34;wow these sound good&#34;  Bluetooth connection worked just as described and no problem.  Only difference from &#34;Chinglish&#34; manual is where it says LED will turn green when connection is successful, mine blinks blue instead.  Only took approx 1/2 hour for initial charge with included USB connector.  Quality appears acceptable but time will tell in use with travel as I intend."
1,"Great product. Received it on time. Come with everything you would need to change out coverplate, plus spare parts."
1,I purchased as a replacement battery for a 5yo device. Item arrived quickly and undamaged. But if you own this device don't bother with replacement.  Clear was sold to Sprint about 2 years ago. I received an email in April 2015 stating they will no longer be offering the Clear WiFi service after October 2015.
1,"This worked great. Perfect for driving with gps or music. Works good for iPhone 6, but I upgraded to 6plus and it does not fit"
1,I use this all the time and would purchase again in a hreat beat.
-1,My case arrived broken. The bottom clip was broke. Case unusable.
1,very good!
0,"Good armband, a little on the small side. I have average/small arms and it can still be hard to wrap around and get a snug fit."
1,Working well thus far. Total bargain!!! We purchased these for our tablet and phones and it works well with both. It also works
1,Overall product is very nice and appears to be well made.  I have owned this product for about 3 months with no issues.  Sound quality is very good once you make sure you have the right size ear buds on to completely fit in your ear.  I would buy this product again.
1,Great speakers for the price.  Easy to install into my '15 Tacoma and sounds pretty good.  I would buy them again
1,Great case!
1,Beautiful case..loved it. And arrived on time. Reason I gave it 4 stars is the fact that it's only available for a s6 edge. I ordered this not paying attention....I know my fault but it was so cute. Got to say my galaxy s6 fits in there and doesn't feel lose at all. Only the buttons do not match with the holes but still able to function good. Definitely true to the picture colors and all.
1,Does the job it is supposed to do....
1,This case did not look like the item online but much to my surprise it was actually nicer and of great quality. Not sure if it was redesigned and pic was not updated but I'm happy with what i got. Thanks
-1,The white part got brown within a week of using.  It wouldn't come off.  Threw my case away after two weeks because it looked so dirty.
1,Fine
1,"Great cover, even better price."
1,"What do you know, my 1 yr old smashed my phone on week 1 of me buying the glass protector. It shattered but the screen did not! yes! Does exactly what it needs to do.<br /><br />Easy to apply, looking through instructions beforehand was more useful 2nd time ;)"
0,Served there purpose... Light weight and color coded... Gold plated
1,Best and smallest case ever!! Recomend!
-1,This cheap version of a lifeproof case was a waste of money. Broke within 5 minutes. Would not recommend to anyone.
1,Great product for the price.  Hope it lasts.  Time will tell!
1,"Love it,"
1,"Disclaimer:  I got this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I love this portable charging station.  It is one of the best designs that I have come across.  I bought it for travel, as I wanted more than 2 usb ports, and with this, I can plug in my laptop as well.  I love that it has a power cord design so versatile…I can unroll it and it can sit on my bedside table or desk, but if I wanted it to hang on the wall socket, it can do that too.  The only annoyance is the super bright blue indicator light that lets you know power is on.  It does not have to be so bright!!!  I will have to tape over it with masking tape or something like that as I'm using it next to my bed.  I would deduct 1/2 star for that if i could. Packaging it came in was busted open when it arrived.  It looks cheap if I were planning to give as a gift.  However, they made up for it by including a nice pouch to keep it in for traveling, which i greatly appreciate.<br /><br />I wish they would make an international version -- with the interchangeable international adapter plugs, so I can use it worldwide too.<br /><br />Update November 25, 2015<br />I deducted a star because the snap that holds the plug broke when I tried to take out the plug for use.  So, I no longer feel this is the best design anymore, and I've found a similar one with a better design where you slide the plug in, instead of popping it in, and it has pink, blue or green accents. However, I have not written a feedback for that yet as it died on me in about a week of use.  Waiting for my exchange before I review.  At least this one still works great, and I've used it in England and Asia for about 2 months."
1,"I love purchasing items from Anker, they have products that always work and their customer service is nothing but World Class"
0,"Connections are not that tight, but it works."
0,Bad fit over the ears. Good sound.
1,This was for my wife (who goes through cables like water). It's still working! She seems to be happy.
-1,"I bought this to plug into the USB port in my car so that two phones can charge at the same time.  I plugged it in, but then decided that I wanted it the other way around.  When I tried to pull it out, the red piece came apart from the silver piece (that plugs into the port).  I was able to push them back together, but it feels like it would come right back apart and won't stand up to being plugged and unplugged more than a couple of times.  Thankfully I don't need to move mine again, but it you're thinking about moving this around between different plugs, beware that it is cheaply made (I think made in China) and you might want to look elsewhere."
1,Sticks great and moves well with my phone. I keep it up on my windsheild and it doesn't budge while I drive!!
-1,Case is nice but was not delivered on time.
1,"Very fast charge. Working great so far. If I needed another, this is the one that I would buy."
1,"I found the sleeve to fit me just fine, with room to adjust to larger/smaller arm size.  The key holder and &#34;snug-feel&#34; for my phone is what makes this a good product."
1,"Very nice, good quality"
-1,"Although this case looked pretty sleek and enhanced the grip, it offered no form of protection for the phone. I had the case for about 2 weeks before I dropped my phone on my hard wood floor only to pick it up and see a crack, not only through the exterior plastic on top of the screen, but also the screen itself...indicating that the case offered real shock absorbing properties. I would NOT recommend buying this case, as it does not withstand the test of a 3 foot drop."
1,fits my needs
1,Like it
-1,"When I'm running any distance over 3-4 miles, this band will chafe my arm if I'm not wearing sleeves. Makes for quite an uncomfortable run.<br /><br />Other than that, I've never had trouble getting the band to stay in place, etc. Keeps out as much moisture as you'd expect, and I haven't had much trouble using my touchscreen (Galaxy S5)"
1,excellent
1,Cool
1,Great case
1,"This is a great product if you have multiple USB-powered devices. Feels very substantial. The bright blue LED makes it a bit distracting for a nightstand. My main disappointment was that it will not charge my Asus Transformer Prime tablet, but then again I have been unable to find anything other than the original charger that came with it that can."
-1,Turned blue the second day
-1,This is the first review I have ever written. I ordered the 2 pack of cables to charge my iphone 6. It arrived with only 1 cable and it didn't even work. Tried 2 different wall adapters and nothing. Do not order from this seller.
1,Perfect.
1,several compliments and inquiries as to where it came from.
1,I love this overall but am unable to get the macro lens to attach  Can anyone help me
1,Works perfect and for a great price too.
1,Nice and thin yet protective.
1,This case is awesome for the price.
1,My wife loves this case!  She couldn't be happier with it because of how sturdy the case and the stand are.  She can drop her phone and not freak out anymore!!!
0,"Hard to keep from getting bubbles, maybe its just me. Like the matt finish, no finger prints."
1,Got this for my mom. The install was easy enough. I like how it resists smudges and seems to<br />Hold up better than the other kind of screen protectors. Really nice for the price!  It does seem too thick to use in an otterbox/ life proof case though
1,Fit perfectly on my phone.
1,I love this case!  I actually use it for carrying my sunglasses in my purse to keep them from getting scratched.  I love the painting and enjoy seeing it every time I put on or take off my sunglasses.  I've gotten compliments from several people because this is such a pretty and unique case!
1,"Love these cases, lightweight and fit sung the rubber on the outside edges keeps them from slipping out of your hand."
1,"Works great.  Very durable cord, seems to be holding up well."
1,Good.
-1,The case is beautiful but it doesn't fit my phone. I triple checked what phone it said it was for. It should fit my phone. In fact I also bought a green case from this company and that one fit! So I thought this one was safe. Very disappointed.
-1,Am really disappointed I bought 2 of this last week and I only got 1screen and after fixing it on my phone  it has a black line in exactly the middle very disappointed with this seller
-1,"Fit the phone, made it water proof, just caused a lot of problems with the camera, looked like you were taking a photo in a tunnel. It inhibited the accuracy of the touch screen as well. Just not real happy with the case."
1,I received these in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />They arrived promptly and as described.<br /><br />This 3ft charging system arrived in easy to open packaging and was simple to assemble.  My IPhone 6 didn't have a problem connecting and charging with this cable.  They are thicker than some of the less expensive models I've owned in the past.  Love it and would recommend it to anyone.
-1,"Cannot see a thing if I'm outside during daylight, for regular use I have to put brightness all the way up and it drains my battery, I will look for another brand."
1,Functions as advertised.  Initially unaware of dual sided tape used to keep Charging Set in place when reinstalling back to phone.
1,Very durable and long enough to use while in bed and plugged in to a socket inconveniently placed just out of reach of the OEM cords.
0,It doesn't stay put. Meaning it just comes out so easily. I'm guessing its because of the size. Otherwise its a great charger.
1,"This is a replacement to an old Belkin 2 usb port charger I had used for years! This is better in that it has 1 quickcharge port kind of to future proof for newer phones that support it and 1 additional port to charge whatever else. Right now I use this to travel, it charges my Nexus 5, Ipad, & Moto 360, so only 1 charger with 3 cables much lighter and organized. Only downside is that it's a bit heavy so it might come loose in the outlet. So just make sure to give enough slack on the cable as to not put additional weight that might pull it out from the outlet."
1,No problems so far.
1,Wonderful product
0,"Great for the price, but came cracked."
-1,"worst set of headphones i have ever bought, i live with my headphones in my ears, must have at least 17 pairs; this was by far the worst money spent towards headphones👎"
1,I like it a lot. It's sturdy and holds cards as well as my phone.
1,You can take this anywhere and do whatever you want to it and its performance doesn't change. It's much smaller than I thought it would be but it packs a punch. Definitely a great speaker with easy connection.
1,Love this thing. So glad that it works with my phone :)
1,Good quality item.
1,"Works decently well, my moto 360 has issues charging on it sometimes but it gets the job done."
1,"I Haven't tested the product fully (tested with a random usb/ac plug and it works) because I'm mainly going to use this as a charging cable when my Anker PowerDrive +1 comes in (taking longer to ship than cable). but already really really pleased with a few things:  1. Delivery was prompt (arrived on a Sunday & it was free!?!?)  2. Shipping packaging was standard yellow envelope but, the box the cable comes in was actually really nice for just a USB cable! I could tell this is going to be a quality cable by just judging the box!  3. For a USB cable its goregous looking the red nylon braid is pretty sick and will look nice (and be easy to find) in my car.  4. Superb build quality! Feels sturdy and  extremely premium! Fits extremely snug in my Note Edge!  I will boost rating to five stars when the PowerDrive comes in and if it can carry the Quick Charge 2.0 amperage."
1,"The blue is not blue it looks more purple, but it's a pretty good case"
0,"Not to clear instructions, should have got the USB version."
1,My charger works great and comes in handy. I got blue which is very pretty. The product is a little larger than I expected but that's fine because it still fits in my pocket. I just wish the package it arrived in was strong because mine arrived with a crack in it. It's not very noticeable so it's ok.
1,This is perfect. Just like the one that comes with my Samsung S5 galaxy. It is really great price and nice to have more than one as I can take this when I travel and have on in another room when I am home.
0,Decent
1,I loveee my new phone case ! It came right on time
1,I love this phone case for my phone. Its very simple but it gets the job done.
-1,"The case is slightly too big for the phone. Although it does keep the Samsung s6's slim look, the actual phone shifts in the case and do not protect the phone at all."
1,Looks great but is hard to keep clean only due to the color.
-1,waste of money.  dont buy.
-1,It arrived broken!!!
1,"Fits the phone perfectly and doesn't make the phone super bulky.  I wasn't sure about spending the money for the case, but with the price of the phone I decided not to be a cheapskate.  I am and &#34;older&#34; person and am pretty careful/easy on my phone but boy am I glad I got this case. First drop --  My 18 month old granddaughter pulled  phone from my back pocket and it fell onto my concrete driveway -- I am happy to report no nicks, no scuffs, no damage!  Since then, there have been a number of other &#34;oops&#34; and everything still like new.  Good investment, looks nice, protects phone, doesn't impede any of the phone functions - what more could you ask for.  Recommended purchase."
1,good replacement
1,"Great case,good price"
1,Works great on the go!
1,"Nice case. Not as protective as my previous Otterbox, but I really love the slim design. Who doesn't love pretty colors?"
-1,"Needs to be updated.  Get rid of the things in Chinese.  The QR code doesn't do anything.  I keep being told to refer to the app, which does nothing except for work with the pedometer.  Couldn't figure out for the life of me how to get text messages to show on the phone.  The font is so small and hard to read, and I've had Lasik surgery and was wearing reading glasses to try and see it.  The instructions are very hard to understand."
1,Great quality
1,Works great for my ipad
1,"Exactly as described. Quick to send out, very reasonable price."
1,This battery is functioning like the original that came with the phone. It will lengthen the life of my irreplaceable phone again.
0,Working just fine but I would get the longer ones.
1,"This thing fits like a glove, looks good and is fairly thin, so it does not add that much to the footprint of the phone. No problem getting headphones or the charge cable to operate correctly, nice product!"
1,"Great case. I use it with a glass laminate to protect the touchscreen.  Love the orange color, makes it easy to find. I'm planning to order a spare for the time when this case gets worn out."
1,Works exactly as I expected it to.
1,"I was pleasantly surprised that the case looks better in person than in the picture.  It's easy to attach, easy to find in my purse and I'm enjoying the compliments."
0,"Keeps the phone dry but I couldn't get my iPhone 5 to take photos consistently and the ones that did come out weren't very good. If you just want it to keep your phone or other items dry and sand free, it works great."
1,"Just got it, feeling pretty good about it right now."
0,"It is a nice lightweight case. The gold color is nice as well.<br />However, it scratches easily. Also, the kickstand broke within a couple weeks of use. Lastly the the hole for the headphones/AUX cord is off like 1/8cm.. so some plugs will not go in while the case is on.<br />Overall, it was a decent buy for the price.. but I probably wouldn't purchase one again."
-1,"Initially, this would have received a 5 star rating.  But, as it no longer functions (after ~1 year or light use), I recommend it with warning.<br />This was plugged in permanently on my desk at work, removed only during occasional work-travel.  This week it stopped working as a wireless charger; does not power on.  The battery does still charge and discharge though, so it's not a total loss."
1,Long as I as i could play Iheartradio or my music player and im good
1,Awesome charger! Charges fast and doesn't overheat my phone.
1,"Great Product at a great price.  Works as promised and provides secure placement for your iPhone and is comfortable to boot.  I would recommend this to runners and walkers everywhere.<br /><br />I find the Iphone 6 itself too big to enjoy wearing in the gym, but that is due to the Iphone and not this product.  This will work for the gym if you don't mind the size of the Iphone itself."
1,great case
1,"Practical, and nice design. Meets my needs."
-1,"Cheap case, broke after the 3rd day."
1,I have a Galexy S5 with a slim case on it and it fits but its a snug fit. Perfect for going out. My strap broke the first time but I just replaced it with a different strap. works great. I would buy it agian.
1,I loved these. They are comfortable for me since I dislike using ear buds.
1,I love this! I can easily charge my phone quick without plunging it to a charger.
1,First screen protector was damaged in shipment (I guess). Top left corner did not set to screen. Explained situation to Maxboost.  They replaced it immediately.  Replacement fits perfectly. They stand behind their product. Very satisfied.
1,"I bought this for my boyfriend who is a welder, so he obviously sweats a lot throughout the day. He still has it, uses it all day every day and loves it. He can hear it while he is in the weld shop, and it sits low enough on his neck it doesn't get burned.<br />I chose the black so dirt wouldn't show up like it would with the white (like I bought).<br />I have a different brand that is ~60 bucks less than this that I use at the gym. The Bluetooth capability on this one holds much stronger distance wise than mine does. I would recommend this over any other brand, any day, and he has recommended it to many of his friends as well who have purchased one."
1,Absolutely love it! This summer was one of the best thanks to this protection! I wish I would of bought it sooner
1,I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He uses it all the time for his phone. Very handy and very sturdy.
1,"Fits well, strong hold. Does not fall, unless you apply very strong force."
1,Works great
1,"It work well for me , it was a bit hard to set up but after a few try I got the instructions could be better"
1,Works great!  Thanks
1,"Fits perfect, and actually makes it easier to slide out the keyboard."
1,"Perfect replacement! Unfortunately Callaway abandoned its line of range finders, orphaning the users. I have met a few who have taken umbrage with the company and are reciprocating the favor by not buying other Callaway products!"
-1,"Even by following the instructions very carefully,  the product ended up covered in bubbles, stretched areas,  and scratches.  Not even worth the trouble to return it.  I just threw it in the garbage,  where it belongs."
1,"Bought this for my significant other who is a huge BTTF fan. It is a slim case for the iPhone 6 with grooves for grip which is beneficial since most plastic cases are slippery and cause the phone to slide out of your hand.  The sticker is as displayed in the advert.  The image is a bit grainy and would be better in a higher resolution, and the words on the top and middle of the capacitor have also been covered with a red block which detracts from the original image, but overall it was a good purchase that I am happy with."
-1,Beware that the manufacturer failed to account for the S6's 2.5D glass curvature at the edges. This screen protector extends at least 2mm into this curved area and you will see a cloudy 2mm line all the way around the perimeter. This is the glue basically spanning the gap between the ultra flat protector and phone's screen slope. A truly outstanding product would be one that followed the curve or accurately stopped where the curve begins. I am convinced flat glass protectors are not the way to go for the S6. Use a film type.
1,Great
1,Works like a charm
1,I got this for my daughter and her husband to take on vacation.  They used it on the beach and the sound was wonderful.  I paid for the one day delivery so they would have it by the time they left.  That extra one day delivery payment was well worth it.
1,Good Protection
1,Its good
1,"My 10 year old daughter just loves this watch.  Th only thing that was a little surprising was the size.  For being a youth watch, it's large."
1,Exactly What I Wanted.
1,Work fine
1,very good product at a great price
1,"Quick Charging, great product.Sturdy and sits at the proper angle on my desk."
1,A little 'staticky' but okay for me. Very retro
1,"Fit and worked well, great price."
1,I use my Jaybird x BlueBuds Sports Headphones during cardio training in the gym.  I used these headphones for about a year with no problems. I do put these headphones thru the sweat ringer and they sound great!!!
-1,"Large, chunky, cheap feeling"
1,"Fast shipping, worked great and had some instructions on charging too!  Thank you"
1,Good cover and light weight. Better than the o box
1,Fast shipping and quality product
1,This is a great head unit. Doesn't react well to fists.
1,Heavy Duty Charger set. charges everything I have very well. I received a discount for leaving a review. I would but it again.
-1,"I wanted the full 8 hour charge, didn't get it, even after charging a full day. Painful to me to wear, even though I tried all kinds of tips; also the way it curled around my outer ear was inflexible and hurtful. Maybe my ears are weird and I just got a bum battery, but returning for a different style."
0,"These headphones are decent. Short battery life, which is stated but still disappointing nonetheless. Only lasts me 2-3 good workouts before I have to recharge. Indicates battery is low about 5 minutes before the headphones die...real nice lol. Also having issues with bluetooth sporadically disconnecting every once in a while. Overall you get what you pay for, which was not much so I would still recommend. Just dont have your hopes up too high."
1,"I ordered this back on August 6th and thought it was a fantastic product. I would have given it 5 stars at the time, but after using if for almost a month, my phone keeps falling out of it. There doesn’t seem to be any way to tighten the hinge and swivel that connect to your phone and so mine keeps drooping and popping out of the device. I think it is a great concept but poor execution.<br /><br />*Update* IPOW reached out to me and it seems I got an earlier version of the device. They have since made changes and modifications based on consumer reviews. They shipped me out the newer version and I must say it is a lot better at holding my phone up and not letting it slam around."
1,"Love the look but had to pay a jeweler to put it on.  Definitely not easy to do yourself, especially with old eyes."
0,Strap broke off and the color started wearing off after a month or so.
-1,Doesn't fit 5S
1,I love it
1,Did not realize how much I would use this product. I never leave home without it. Taking pictures all day drains the battery fairly quick on my Lumia Icon but having power bank with me I never have to worry about it. Very happy with the purchase. Thinking this might make a good gift during the holiday season for the family.
1,"Fits  great, looks good, and seems to be as sturdy as similar cases such as Otterbox but far less expensive."
1,"I'm a fan of Anker's products because they are made with superb quality & lasting performance and this PoweLine Micro USB {1ft} charging cable is no exception. I've used this cable to charge a Samsung tablet, HTC One M8 cellphone and an iPhone. I noticed that it charges my devices a lot faster than traditional USB cables that I've had in the past. It's very strong due to the tough kevlar material on the inside of the cable. The PowerLine Micro USB Cable will charge any device with a USB to micro USB connection. The compatibility is endless. Bending the Anker PowerLine Micro cable countless times will not hurt it one bit. These charging cables are tough and built to last. They come in different lengths. Be sure to get a length that is suitable for your needs. The only USB charging cable you will ever need and it's backed by a company you can trust. I was supplied this sample for test and evaluation purposes. I promise this review is fair and honest."
-1,It's thing barely works I wouldn't recommend this to product. I gave this product a 2 because the light came on when I plugged it in.
1,It works fine
1,nice item
1,daughter loves it
0,Looks like a quality product. Designed well in terms of looks but the problem is it's a bit thick at the back in one spot and it's hard to pull the cards out.
1,Long enough to plug in my cell phone and still have mobility
1,"This is a clear. Great product, works with all devices and is reasonably priced. The grip works as described"
1,"Fits like a glove, Very classy minimalistic flipcase."
1,Works great gas shipment
-1,"Claimed all in one Gps For running, cycling, swimming and golf. Great when it actually works but frustrated by its lack of reliability. Difficulty syncing device. Frequently resets itself during the day on its own. Vibration feature stopped working, rendering the alarm feature useless."
1,"I'm really excited about this iphone 5s screen protector because it is the same kind that I bought at the phone store for over $25. In my opinion, these tempered glass screen protectors are far superior to the flimsy peel and stick ones that end up with bubbles underneath or peel off after a few months.  Touch screen works great through this screen protector. This is one solid piece that you lay down on your screen all at once. The kit comes with wipes, and easy instructions.  Works great with my iphone 5S. Very satisfied with this purchase."
1,The only thing I would have to say is I suggest that you go and get better rca cables because the ones they give you are garbage.
1,Good quality item
1,Great idea & makes charging so much simpler.  Super good price as single units of lesser quality cost same or more & this is much better quality.
1,"Love the feel, the look, and the protection.  I definitely recommend this product for iphone users."
-1,"The cable broke, it is not as good as I expected"
1,"This is one of my favorite Trent cases. The design is slim but robust and slides into pockets very easily. The back rubber is very shock resistant. For a non-waterproof case, it does a good job at repelling dust."
-1,I put the iOttie on the dashboard of my newly-purchased Porsche for one weekend and it has permanently damaged the dashboard. This thing will destroy your car! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
1,Just great.
1,Excellent product. i recommend to buy.... nice look and tough too
-1,Recharge slow.  Not enough power to charge my cell phone.
0,"Looked nice,  but did not fit my 6plus LifeProof case!"
1,Good
1,Good
-1,"I fix iPhones as a little side job and recommend they buy your screens but lately I've been telling them different. Your screens come in perfect condition but the gram attached to the glass comes apart very easily and shows light coming from inside the phone. This can be frustrating because there is no way to attach the plastic back to the glass, please take this into consideration when making new screens."
1,I am very happy with it
0,you need to buy a better antenna to make this work well
1,Product was as described and arrived on time.
1,really works
1,Just as described.
1,great case.  being on a farm i have no worries when it comes to keeping my phone safe.  it is harder to hear when talking to anyone but i just put it on speaker phone and problem solved
1,The case came between the estimated delivery date. It looks great and protects my phone fabulously. I dropped my phone with this case and not a scratch. I'm really happy with this case! :)
-1,"Had it for almost 2 months, noticed after a month it got a huge air bubble on the bottom left, right on the corner. I guess it lost it's stickiness. Then just today it got scratches a butt ton from my iphone case. So much for anti-scratch. For the price it's fine. But I wouldn't pay full price for it."
1,The phone was in perfect condition and works like brand new.
1,"Got this for our I phone 6 plus, and Samsung 5, works great for both phones"
-1,"Purchased July 15, 2015 fell apart August 28, 2015.  Not a good value purchase."
-1,Solar panels don't actually charge the battery. Set it out in the sun all day and no charge is accrued. Only charges if you plug it in.
-1,the magnetic closure has a small magnet so it doesn´t close properly most of the times.
-1,"Fits well, but both pieces are hard plastic.<br /><br />Failed to prevent damage to phone from accidental drop like my previous case was able to (Seidio Active)"
1,It's great
0,I like the look and durability but don't like that you cannot login with the thumb and it covers the back camera
1,😊
-1,Did not sync with my phone and have had no luck with it working
1,Looks great and works well.
1,"i love love love this case, it's so cute and girlie as i expected it to be and it came on time, definitely will do more business!!!"
1,"Love this case. It's thin, attractive, rugged... better than the first version I got from Spigen.<br />The S5 gets a bit warm from the CPU sometimes, but this case is easily removed if needed.<br />I run A LOT... this fits into the armband including the case!<br />There's a lip this protrudes ever so slightly around the glass to lift and protect it... the case is sharp and professional looking. The rubberized corner and end pieces don't mark up and don't impede the fiction of any charge or earphone jack... the camera and the finger heart beat sensor work perfectly... in fact, the finger heartbeat sensor are easier to align now!"
1,"Other than I cannot figure out how to delete items from this telephone, it works great"
1,Absolutely a great product and cost way below product quality. I love it!
1,just plain works.
1,1 week in. Quality feels excellent for $. This has 3 card slots and the cash pocket so be aware. I hope the 6s+ case is of equal or better design.
1,"I work at a factory, operating fork trucks and tuggers, and I needed something to protect my phone in case of a drop. I believe I bought the right case for the job.<br /><br />About a day in using the product, my phone accidentally fell down the stairs in my home landing on the hardwood floor. It must have hit the steps around 3 or 4 times. Upon inspecting the phone, both case and phone were scuff free. What a relief.<br /><br />My only complaint with this case is my phone came with one of the glassy screen protectors, and the film on the case isn't plush with the screen. It makes it so little things can get into the hole where the home button is (like sand or dirt) and you have to be firm with your touch to get to the touch screen. I also would like a white version of the case to match my white phone, but oh well."
1,I like it!
1,So impressed with this headset - insanely comfortable with a good load of soft padding that means I can take them off after a good few hours as if I'd never had them on at all - no pain.
1,Makes driving an ease when using GPS which is why I purchased this for my son. He just got his license and I wanted him to be able to see the GPS without looking down at his phone.  He tells me he could really feel the difference from a safety perspective.  Yay for mom!
0,It works well. I've had a few issues staying connected though.
1,"I really like that there is a bit of side and corner protection. The main attraction for me was the amount of angles once could use the tablet in. Aside from the 3 indentations, you can also fold a cover in for 2 additional viewing angles. I could care less the magnetic strip used for the auto-wake function and quick opening/closing but it's a neat feature for those who want it. I've had my case for over a year and it still works and looks just like new."
1,Awesome
1,Perfect replacement for my lost ear hooks
-1,"I've used this dashcam for a couple of weeks now and while the camera itself is great, the power adapter that comes with it is so unshielded that it actually interferes with the FM radio in my car.  I've tried moving the cable around and other solutions but no matter what I try as soon as I plug the adapter to the camera or any device, it immediately kills my radio reception across multiple frequencies.  I switched to using a different USB car power adapter and the interference went away, so it's definitely the adapter that came with the camera."
1,Husband loves it.  He ordered this to replace his current one that has too scratched of lens.
1,Just as described.
1,Loved the case. Hated my ex. Easily flammable.
1,I used it for two years and loved it. Now my 12 yr old son is using it. Worth the money!
1,LOVE MY LITTLE REMINDER OF JESUS! I KEEP IT ON MY KEYCHAIN!
-1,These are great for the price if you ONLY want to charge your device. They did not work for data transfer.
1,Perfect
-1,I wonder what phone actually fits in-between the steering wheel mines didn't (iphone 6/ Mazda 2)
-1,Didn't even work :/
1,The mic works great. Wish I had purchased it sooner.
1,The rubber handle part slides up and down and so sometimes the button is not aligned with the slip cover and therefore will not work correctly.
1,Very nice i iwll buy it again.
1,it charges real fast
-1,"Not happy...worked great for the first couple of days, now they don't stay plugged in, keep falling out. Don't want to wiggle around so much so my port doesn't get messed up."
1,good quality
-1,It did not fit my iPhone 6.  Shipping cost too much to return it considering what it cost.  Now out of money and can't use it.
1,Nice comfortable set of phones...great stereo sound...customer service is fantastic...My pair were delivered damaged and I got a replacement in two days.
1,This case is amazing! It's slim but sturdy. It doesn't add bulk to my phone at all. The rubberized egdes wrap around the lip of the phone and protects the front edges nicely and provide a good grip while holding the phone. Will definately purchase more! :)
-1,I ordered a iPhone 6 Case & received a iPhone 5 case. 👿
1,An iPhone 6 with an Apple case on it fits in the armband.
0,Was super cute at first. But the &#34;wood&#34; print started fading almost immediately. Still cute from a distance. But not very professional looking up close.
1,First time user.Fast shipping. Great multi used battery charger and flashlight all in 1 and easy to use.
1,"hold the charge, charger is a convenient touch.  I would recommend these batteries"
1,"(+) Awesome performance as expected.<br />(+) Zen UI very user-friendly and highly customizeable.<br />(+) All bloatware uninstallable<br />(+) Camera flash powerful<br />(+) Good grip for a big phone - Due to the thought behind the design.<br /><br />(-) Removing the back panel for the first time is tough - google-in on how to, there is a method.<br />(-) Power hardware button not responsive - But thank you touch screen double tap on.<br />(-) Camera not great, but ok - SW tries to fix the HW limitations<br />(-) Screen colors are not very bright. - not a major concern as its easy on my eyes<br />(-) No original back panels sold separately - thus far.<br />(-) Fast charge heats the battery. Worried that it will make the overall battery's life span less as its abused by heat - I use my husbands regular Sony charger occasionally.<br />(-) Weak speaker."
1,Great product I really was inpressed with packaging
1,Saved my iPod!!  It is NOT for the week hearted but it does work great.  Tool failed when used.  The battery did not last 6 months!  I am not impressed!!
1,Great product. Fast shipping.
1,"Very nicely made little pouch, hard exterior protects my Nano Ipod. The hard exterior also means if I am listening and touch the pouch the setting do not change!  Love the colour, I have the plum one.  It fits the Ipod but it a bit short if I want to zip it up with the head phone jack plugged in."
1,They are okay.  They need to be just a little bit longer.  Otherwise they are good.
1,"Got it while it was on sale. It does the job well, and I really enjoyed using it."
1,good for price
1,Wonderful! I love this case. It fits incredible my Galaxy S6 edge. Four stars just because the shipping delay.
0,The picture is ok but I knew it wasn't going to be the best before I bought it. For the price it was worth it.
1,Pleased with this case
1,Looks JUST like the photo and I like the no slip grip on the side of the case. I guess mine isn't slipping b/c I put a magnet insert in the back for a hands free car mount.
1,"Best investment I made in recent trip to Scotland. It gave me a single point to recharge our phones, pads, reader, and toothbrush! A real life saver."
-1,Very dissatisfied. The car charger has ready become defective and it's only a few days past 30days so I'm unable to return.
1,"I have had these headphones for over a week now and I can say that I like them.  This is my first pair of bluetooth earphones so I was very excited when I received my item.  The packaging is AMAZING.  Honestly, this is one of the best shipments I have ever received as far as packaging.Upon opening the box, I immediately tested the product out.  It is very simple to sync to my iphone, and fits well in my ears.  Turning on and off is simple too with its audio commands.  I have since used them while at work, as well while I cut my grass.  They stay in place, there is not a long cord connecting me to a phone, and the charge life on mine is sufficient for my need.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for an unbiased review."
1,works pretty good everyone says they hear me fine
1,nice product
1,"Very good charger, so good I purchased another one. I have the Galaxy S4 with 7500 zerolemon battery and charger works flawlessly."
1,Came on time!! The case in very light and works perfectly.
-1,Charges quickly but the light on the end is too sensitive. If I use my phone while plugged in it shines in my eyes
-1,the lights for caps lock and num lock were broke when i got it out of the box wasn't very happy.
1,"[[VIDEOID:4a3c457c525011e8a0c9f3ed4929278]]I am extremely hard on my Iphone. If it's not being dropped on the ground it's being sat on! I am forever dropping my phone, always trying to carry to many things at once and my phone gets the grunt of it. So I NEED a good protective case ALL THE TIME. When this came up for review- yup- I wanted in. It arrived and I so loved my color choice. It comes in so many color choices that there's a perfect color choice for everyone. But the Lime Green and Grey is the BEST in my humble opinion. The case has multiple layers, a plastic protective screen cover, a silicone cover and a hard case. The combination of the three makes this a really durable case. I originally thought it would be bulky but I was proven wrong. It's nice and sleek. My wireless wasn't interfered with either and the case has what I call a kick stand. I can prop up my phone to watch movies or videos.  Talk about convenience! Overall I honestly like this case. I did drop my phone- Shock right? It bounced. My phone is still working just fine waiting to take all the future abuse poor lil `ole me can give it.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  #TQR"
1,"Its works great. Stay in place, doesnt come lose in time."
0,"Didn't last very long.  I would've liked to have gotten a year out of it at least.  I know I can be rough on these cords, but I'm not that rough."
1,Great Product
1,Love this phone case! Fits perfectly on my iPhone 6 plus. Got here in less than a week. Nice packaging!!
-1,It looks great at first but was broke soon within a month. What is the use of it if it breaks without dropping the phone? I did not even carry it everyday so I was very disappointed by the poor quality. Don't buy it. It's a waste of money.
-1,"Both cords out of the box will charge my iPhone6, neither one will charge my iPad Air.  The iPad dings as though it has been plugged in and then it shows the message &#34;not charging&#34;"
-1,This cord was torn when it arrived. My husband and I waited a month to receive the cord. We had to throw it away
1,great
1,It works well but it is made rather cheaply and the front plastic clear cap falls of a lot also there is not much space between the two ports making a little difficult to plug in two devices at a time but other then that I loved the product.
-1,Horrible quality!! I went through six in under a month
1,Perfect fit.  Looks great!  VERY pleased.
1,Thank you!
1,Great product! Prompt delivery as well.
0,Good design very poorly executed. The gripper mechanism does not work
1,My husband loves it!!
1,Loveing my case
1,Had two of the lime green color stands sent to me that had manufacturer defects. JETech has been great about making sure I was satisfied and sent me the updated version and it works great. The craftsmanship of the updated version is miles ahead of the old version.
1,"Good case, needs more space for cards."
1,Fit as expected
-1,As everyone else has noted the holes dont line up for the corner brackets. Its not worth the cost of returning but hey it was a $15 screen so what are you going to do? Personally I installed it and redrilled the holes to make the piece work.
1,It is my first time to have a case from Spigen and I like the  sleek design of the case. It really protected my cellphone.
1,Excelent. The only one problem i have with it is that it last too much to charge.. but its 10k mah how not?
-1,"It didnt work on my Toyota Venza. It has nice design, but if you want to to remove/ attach the phone several time during the day, you should get something that is sturdy and stable."
-1,"Good headphones, easy delivery, esay to use. The only bad thing is there is no other earplugs to accomodate your ear .. what you see is what you get, also it comes with a separate plastic cover to use I guess when you using them so sweat doesnt get to the buttons but it doesnt make it easier to use. It also used to disconnect out of nowhere..  not a good buy"
-1,"After fully charged it only lasts 1/2 a day before it needs charging again. Would not refer a person to buy this product, am in the process of requesting a full refund"
1,Charges the phone just fine.  Have not had any problems.  Will try some more when on camping and fishing trips...
-1,it did not work after only two weeks of using it . very dissapointed
-1,Not good I wouldn't recommend.
1,liked it
1,Very pleased. Works great and no hassle easy to use
1,"So many items I've ordered end up being a different color once I get them. This, I'm proud to report, was not one of them. It looks exactly as photoed here.<br /><br />The green is pretty, and unique. It isn't neon or dark, it is somewhat in between. A darkened neon, perhaps? It's see through as well so you are able to see the apple logo clearly. The bumper is white and plastic, but very sturdy.<br /><br />This will protect your phone well. It is cushiony and secures the phone well, especially with that added bumper. It's very pretty, fits well, and stands out compared to some standard cases.<br /><br />*I purchased this product at a discount. This review contains my honest and unbiased feedback. All thoughts/opinions are my own entirely."
1,great product and fast service.  will recharge your phone in no time!
-1,Couldn't get this case on to save my life!!
1,"High Quality digitizer worked well on my kids iPad. With a help of Youtube video, i was able to repair this on my own."
1,"Great fit. I would almost venture to say that it is a better fit than the previous screen protector I was replacing. Due to the curved nature of the phone screen near the edges, there is a narrow ring around the edge of the screen protector that does not sit flush for most brands of screen protectors. This leads to dust and lint getting under the edge of the screen protector and eventually allowing it to lift away from the screen (this is what happened with my previous screen protector). The iLLumiShield protector fits just the flush portion of the screen (which means that it is actually SMALLER than most other screen protectors, but that is a good thing in this case), and hopefully will not be prone to dust and lint getting under the edge of the screen protector. Very satisfied so far (2 weeks of use).<br /><br />Will update if situation changes."
1,Itemas described! Works Great!
-1,It does not fit my phone very well (iPhone 6 with Otterbox Defender case) and does not hang low enough from my rearview mirror (Honda CR-V) to fit my phone. Looking at ways to rig it so it's usable.
0,Not as sturdy
1,"Just so happy with this case. I've only ever bought one other case, but it wasn't as great as this one. I drop my phone regularly and it just bounces, unscathed. The kickstand is handy."
1,"Works wonderful, takes great pictures in the case. Phone calls are clear. Only negitive is that i find it hard to open."
1,"I have had no problems with this case and recommend it highly.  It fits great and protects well enough that falling off a car roof at 25mph and tumbling on the road a bit did not cause any damage to my, er, my friend's phone.  Yeah, that's it.  My friend."
-1,"this stand stinks!!! it doesn't stay up , keeps falling down every time i attempt to set it up.  iYou get waht you pay for. :/"
-1,"Great product but after couple weeks stopped working. I Kept it in perfect condition also. No sweating , no drops , no water and still stopped working. Cheap quality. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Awesome! Charges my Note 3 very quick.
1,Love the case feels great looks great pretty pink color takes drops well
0,it has been about 3 months and it still works but the plastic cover is coming off at the lightening end. I think it is the begining of the issue and it is going to stop working soon. I am going to give it another month and return it. I will update in a month with what happens.
1,"this is a great product, i received a discount on my order for a fair review,<br />its made very well."
0,Its nice for what I paid for it.
1,I needed a thin-tip stylus pen to highlight eTextbook lines in my Fire HD 6 and these work very well!
1,It's great!  The windshield mount kept popping off and scary the crap out of me!
1,Product arrived ahead of schedule and performs as anticipated.
1,Very cute case. My daughter loves the princess in her iphone. So far the case is being sturdy and doing it's  job.
-1,Handle did not correctly line up with button once opened. You get what you pay for.
-1,"I only gave these 2 stars because they do not hold a charge for more than 2 hours...  that's very inconvenient since they take so long to charge.  Otherwise they have pretty good sound and a fair range, you really can't get too far from your phone and I found they don't really work with my iPod at all.  Very disappointing!"
1,Great product! As advertised
1,"Cute case, make sure you get a screen cover for the front of the phone. I like the stand but don't like that it can only stand one way. Makes it easier to watch videos on my phone without holding it"
-1,Very poor quality!
1,"The battery Works Great.<br />The tools I needed came with the battery,<br />Was very easy to replace."
-1,Wrong product to expensive to send back
1,Very nice and clear
0,"Music  sounds clear but about two weeks into using  the there was some crackling  that happen  twice  a couple  days apart iv only had the about 4 weeks now and it's only  happened twice. Possibly  bad connection  for what ever reason,  I am using  a galaxy 4  phone  my range away from my phone is about 40 ft  the only other real issue  other than the crackling  that has only happened twice is that at times I have to keep readjusting them in my ear because they fall out now this my be an issue with my ear shape but over all I really  like them as long as the crackling doesn't  continue  I am a firefight is south Georgia and wear  these when I train so the heat and sweat play a factor in keeping them snug in my ear . However  they do not drawn out background  noise  too good  but the music is very  clear so you still hear your beats very good but can also distinguish other noises  which is a good thing when I'm listening  for an emergency  dispatch as well.  Over all a month into having them I feel the money was well spent ."
1,the waterproof case works underwater I did the test that it said to do that worked great but on my case the part that opens and closes for you to charge your phone broke just two weeks after I put it on my phone so now it's no longer waterproof  I think it hey need to fix that one part or make its just the that was sent to me all in all the case does it job
1,It is what I was expecting plus It is a peace of mind the warranty that came with it.  Thanks!
1,"Very good quality, transfer speeds are great."
1,"Came on time, the color is different from the picture tho, it looks whiter in person"
1,Worked just fine and the price was affordable...
-1,Color is dull/ugly in person. Almost looks like plastic. Can only fit 5 cards comfortably. Hole for stylus access is sharp and uncomfortable.
1,"This is such an amazing case not only does it look awesome it protects my phone 100%. It comes in three layers the first is made of rubber which fits perfectly over my phone. The case doesn't stretch like most rubber cases and it keeps my phone in place (and trust me I've already dropped out a few times and my phone didn't get any damage or fall out. The next layer is plastic and has a stand for easy no hands access which is great when I'm watching videos, cooking, or playing music without muffling the sound. And then there is the plastic case with a clip that I fit on my pants so I can have it easily accessible for when I'm at work. So if I'm not wearing pockets I still can have my phone on me and again it was made to stay in place and not slip or fall off! Every piece was built with high quality materials for durability and ultimate protection. I absolutely love my phone case and you will too! I received this product at a discounted rate for an unbiased review."
1,Great kit! It has everything I needed and made my installation a breeze.  I will buy this kit again for future installations if it is still available.
1,Absolutely love this power bank!! Charges my phone fast and helps me to keep up with my customers for my business!
1,Exactly as pictured and just what I wanted. Delivered promptly.
1,"The holder is robust and keep my phone in place, also very easy to remove."
0,Case worked great unless you took pics with flash on then you would get green hue on all pictures.
0,The only quibble I have with this case is the amount of force required to activate the cell phone volume and on/off buttons. The case buttons are too stiff. Other than that the case is very trim and looks good.
1,good for price
1,"Great product , works awesome in the right station"
1,its okay product
1,love love love.
-1,this case it was delivered four days later then expect. it's tight and it really doesn't fit my phone when I put it on it takes the back off of my phone. I hate this case. It took so long I just went the the place I bought my phone n bought on for 20$ it's nicer and I needed one asap. This is crap and I don't recommend.
1,"[iOS] Right out of the packaging the Bluetooth connection was efficient and easy.  Works exactly as advertised when using the iOS camera app, without any additional apps needed.  You press the button and it fires the shutter.  I've taken a few dozen shots with no glitches.  It doesn't trigger my Camera+ app however, although I haven't installed any CamKix apps to bridge that process.  Durability of the fob is probably adequate, but it's not something I'd want to drop too many times or step on."
-1,The car charger never worked.
1,Excellent
1,"I loved the quick service and the headset.  It is very comfortable to wear and easy to operate.  I haven't really had an opportunity to assess the sound quality, but will write another review to share my opinion."
1,Great headphones to workout in.
1,"UPDATE 10/9/15 - I emailed Gear Beast Customer Service after they left a comment on this review.  They apologized for Amazon's old stock and offered to replace my arm band with no extra cost or effort on my part.  The replacement does support an iPhone 6 Plus comfortably.  I have updated my review from 2 Stars to 4 Stars and applaud the Customer Service I received from Gear Beast.  They definitely stand by their customers.  I saw reviewer complaints that the cutouts for the iPhone 6 Plus were on the wrong side, but I also saw the company reply to those comments saying the issue had been fixed.  The one that immediately comes to mind was dated October 2014.  Based on this, I purchased the item for my iPhone 6 Plus, assuming the issue was resolved.  Well, either the company lied about the issue being fixed, or I got some seriously old inventory.  My item, received July 2015, had the cutout on the wrong side.  The phone fits, but I have to leave the end flap open in order to plug in the headphones.  It works fine while walking (I just position the open flap facing upwards so the phone doesn't slip out the bottom), but I'm not sure if this will hold up to running.  Unfortunately, I discovered this too late to return the item.  I'm pretty disappointed that the company is still sending out defective products.  Item is otherwise comfortable, so I'll give it 2 stars for that alone."
1,"This is a great and affordable case! I have kept one of these on my phone since my $50 Otter Box only lasted a few months before breaking. I am working on my second case since the first one only lasted a few months before it needed to be replaced. I would highly recommend giving it a try, replacing a $9 case after 4 months is so much better than replacing a $50 one. It will not last forever, but you will get your money out of it and it protects your phone great. My phone has been dropped countless times and held up. My advice is to keep only one card per slot to not stretch out the slots. That is what keeps happening to mine."
1,case snapped on easily but now phone does not fit in carry case.
1,I love this battery. It works great holding a charge longer then the original battery. Gives me more time to play games on my phone. This would also be a great back up battery incase you run out of power on the go. Using this as the primary battery in my Galaxy S III for 9 months so far and have only ran out of power a couple of days. A few times forgot to charge my phone at night or I was playing games on my phone between classes and drained my battery.
1,LIKE THS PRODUCT AS WELL
1,very good product
1,Great phone at a great price.
1,This is what I need. It looks small but fit the charger. White color very pretty. Thanks.
1,I love this iPhone wallet . Works perfectly!
1,"THIS IS REAL NICE HOLDS YOUR CELL PHONE ON THE VENT VERY EASY TO MOUNT . REQUIRE VERY LITTLE ASSEMBLING . NOT LIKE A LOT OF THEM YOU GET AND HAVE TO PUT ON DASH AND THEN THE STUFF USED IS STUCK UNTIL YOU FIND SOMETHING TO TAKE IT OFF WITH . THIS IS VERY PORTABLE YOU CAN PUT IT IN ANY VEHICLE .

-1,The case looked good but it was only one week till it started to tear the belt clip
1,"Nicely made, good material. It does obscure my phones camera and I need to reconfigure the phone case design, but it's fine as it is before and after. I would buy again."
1,"this case for the price is amazing. Nice firm rubber, great color I feel its gonna hold up awhile. my only issue now is I need a belt clip for it."
0,"The first device I received broke after a week of use. I ordered another device, this one seems to be working ok so far, though it hasn't been that long so we will see what happens. Fingers crossed...."
1,Super handy.  Great find.
-1,He picture was cool but the phone case looked nothing like the picture. It was screen printed on there and all stretched out like there was no effort involved putting it together. Don't waste your money.
0,Great Sound.<br />Great Quality.<br />Battery runs out pretty quick. No power save or auto shut off mode.
-1,Cheaply made.  Only good as a short term fill in product.
1,"Amazing amp for the money.  Originally had it hooked up to the shallow 10&#34; pioneer sub, now I'm running a JL 13w6 and it still powers it like a champ.  Haven't had any problems what so ever."
0,"Delivery was quick! I was very excited to have received this case for my phone, but was a tad disappointed. The case doesn't seem to fit my phone correctly, even though its the correct size for it. Color is nice, just not the best design. Just hoping that if my phone drops, the case stays on."
1,Terrific!
0,"Very overpriced but, of course, I knew that when I bought it and decided it was cute enough to overpay for it.  The reason I took away one star is because of how weak it is.  It will charge my phone overnight but my tablet takes forever.  And the tablet drains energy faster than it charges, if I'm trying to use it while it is plugged in.  Update: took off another star because it will no longer charge my tablet at all.  Since my tablet charges just fine on our other chargers, it has to be this adorable little droid causing the trouble.  Bummer!"
1,"ok , Do i see a difference from this model in comparison with the regular UV5RA nope. feels the same quality is the same maybe the internals are different but i can't notice them overall i really love the brand Solid product!"
1,"I purchased his case for my 11 year daughter. She tends to be a bit rough with her electronics so this case was perfect for her. It's quite sturdy however, it came with a clip back to it and the phone in the case doesn't even fit in it. I'm not sure if it was randomly thrown into my order or not but it's rather useless-hence the 4 star."
1,"This Tracfme is evetything advertised and ecverything I wanted. I have no use for a smartphone. Activatiion was no problem and adding minutes was quick and easy. My wife saw it and played around with it a bit, thin asked mi to order one exactly the same to replace her contract phone. Very intuitive."
-1,Broke at the first time when on the floor and I cannot return it
1,Great value. No problems
1,I purchased this to work with an old polycom unit I had from the 90's.  It works perfectly and now I can use the Polycom for my long conference calls with multiple people in the room.
1,"I bought these earbuds, and I have such small ears that most others done stay in ears...even just walking. But with this, I can move in every which way, walk, jog and move my head back and forth and they don't budge! Great value! And I love the Bluetooth feature so I don't have to worry about a long cord bouncing around or getting tangled! Highly recommend!"
1,My daughter loves it good product.
-1,I could never get this item to work and i didn't use it until after 30 return policy expired lesson learned always test product immediately.
1,Excellent Bluetooth for the price.
1,Very good audio system
-1,love idea of thicker cord but my phone rejects it
1,"Great, cheap case. Def get this is you are on the fence but want to save money. This case has kept my wife's 6+ safe from a toddler for a year now. The only drawback is the strange plastic covering over the passcode ID button. It wrinkles and warps a bit so using this would not be possible."
1,"Love itt. It keeps my phone nice and dry, can't wait to use it on my vacation"
1,Pretty good for a cheap little case. Doesn't protect much but it was more for looks than protection. The pink is a litttttle but more dark than in the picture but I think it's because in the picture it's on the white phone and mine is gray.
1,It works as advertising.
1,"This headset is an excellent product especially for the price.  It was a little tricky at first getting the bluetooth to connect but once connected, the headset worked like a charm.  I use my mobile phone as my work phone and this headset makes it sound like I am on my handset and it does have decent amount of noise cancelling.  I would definitely recommend this wireless headset."
1,good
-1,Love the way it looks but it started peeling the first week I had it. 😕
1,"great headphones for the price! I bought them because my similarly priced Sony's were wearing out, and those don't cancel noise half as well. I think the black looks nicer on second thought, but the white ones give me no problems"
0,"I had a lifeproof case for my iphone 5 before I got the iphone 6, and I figured that I could try using a different waterproof case that wasn't as expensive as lifeproof for my new phone. Well I loved the color, and the package came in a day earlier than expected but when I did the waterproof test, I found that water actually got inside the case. Also, the notch where you can turn the volume on/off doesn't move on the case, and it was very hard to separate. So now I don't even use the case anymore. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"Only used it for about a week. They work fine. They don't feel like the original apple cable, and you might find some measurement differences that are negligible: see the picture. But all in all they are worth the price and I am happy with them so far."
1,Good
1,"The case is great, people can hear you speak, etc. it's a little heavy but you'd get use to it quickly. Lastly, the headphones port is hard to use with right angles beats wired earbuds. Otherwise it's totally perfect!"
1,Very nice case and a conversation piece as well
1,These are great!!!  And the price is even more amazing...I highly recommend these for purchase
0,Fits well on my bike and on my phone. The only thing that I did not like was the fact that the bottom left ledge to help hold the phone in place actually blocks the auxiliary to plug in my headphones. Other than that it works pretty well.
1,"I have been using this case while wade fishing on the Texas gulf coast for about three months and it is absolutely stellar. I am able to bring my phone to snap a quick fish picture so I can release fish but still have proof/ a nice memory of the moment. The silicone covering over the screen works surprisingly well wet or dry and there have been absolutely no leaks to date. The only thing you are missing with this case is access to the side buttons, but who cares.<br /><br />Very well-working product, get it."
1,Works
-1,The joint between the base and the arm doesn't have enough tension to hold my phone up. Because of this my phone ended up flopping around and flying out of the holder on several occasions. It could have easily taken a bad trajectory and landed screen first on a hard surface. I say use at your own risk...
0,"This case has done a great job protecting my phone.  I have had for a few months now and although it has a few scrapes, my phone is still intact.  I was impressed with the padding on the inside as well that protects the back of the phone from scraping.  Colors are as pictured as well."
1,This is a beautiful case that looks very elegant. I've had no issues with it and I would definitely recommend this brand to my friends.
1,Came on time and was more than expected.
1,thankyou
1,This thing rocks.  Took two on a week-long trip inside Grand Canyon.  Charged all the Go-Pro cameras for the entire week.
1,"I've been using this case for about a year now.  I like the slim fit, which allows it to slid into my pocket easily.  The rubber is starting to get a little loose, so it might be time to email Otterbox about a replacement."
1,Good
1,Very happy with this purchase. Teen driver now has hands free and can even use this speaker with the GPS on her iPhone. It's small and sleak. She loves it.
1,Great swimming gear.
1,"Velcro lasted about 5 seconds. On first attempt to unfasten the Velcro, the glue released from the bag. Good thing the bag has 3 zip locks so the Velcro isn't really needed anyway. I like the strap and I easily fit my Bluetooth speaker and two phones plus ID and a Credit card with no issues."
1,Neat little item. Very pleased
1,I love this case! It got pretty dirty pretty fast but it's easy to clean. But all cases like this get dirty really fast. And for the price it was perfect
0,"This case feels great and fits tight. I immediately liked it when I put it on my note 4. Unfortunately the aluminum number cause my phone to go into 3G / no service fairly often. It also causes my wifi signal to sit around 1-2 bars max. I work for a cellular company and therefore understand when I am losing service due to an unrelated network issue. This case looks and feels amazing, but it is certainly not worth the loss in service."
1,"Very nice! I made a mistake and ordered the vase for s6 but needed s6 edge & the seller was great with getting right back to me & let me know they did have the case I wanted and would ship me the right case. It came right on time & my daughter loves it. It came with a screen protector, cloth, & stylus pen. The case really grips the phone perfect."
1,"An obvious upgrade to swap out a year and a half year battery, but no noticeable difference from the stock one when you first get it.  At the time this was cheaper and i would buy again."
1,nice
1,"Easy case, easy to change"
1,Extremely cute
0,"Would work better if your bike is quieter.  Even with 2, if you have loud pipes youre not hearing much of anything at highways speeds.  Not bad for putting around locally, especially for the $$"
1,"As a person that doesn't leave home without my Fitbit on my wrist, I don't think I could ever have enough bands for my Fitbit Flex.<br /><br />This is the second set of replacement bands that I have from this same company and I love them! These are plain colored bands, but they still look very nice and come in a variety of shades.  I find them comfy to wear, but I will say they run slightly smaller than the original bands that come with the Flex.<br /><br />I like that these close tightly, and feel very secure when I have them on. Even though they close tightly, I still I always make sure to add a clasp fastener for extra security and definitely recommend doing that. The Flex is a pricey little gadget and I like having all the extra security against losing it that I can get.<br /><br />I love being able to just grab whatever one suits my outfit or my mood and head out the door. I received some to review, and I can honestly say that I love them and wear these every single day."
1,Great for price!
-1,"No mesh earpiece, lines on the screen after professional install.  Tried 3 times to verify installation but the next screen installed without issue - this was just a bad screen.  Good price, unfortunate experience."
1,Compact and great quality.
-1,All cables stopped charging my phones after short use.
-1,After two months both of the these chargers have failed.  No one will get back to me about replacements.  DON'T ORDER FROM THSES PEOPLE!!
1,Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
1,Love this Garmin band. It is super.
1,Nice product at a nice price
1,great
1,perfect
1,"works well, and was reasonably priced"
1,Excellent
1,Great way to protect your screen!
1,Item as described!
1,Works great!
-1,"Does not work, camera wont focus. Additionally there were no instructions in the package. Look elsewhere"
1,Great product for a great price.
0,"Does a pretty good job of holding the phone.  Takes up a lot of room and the bracket doesn't have much adjustment for tilt.  Seems sturdy enough, but time will tell."
-1,This product is not as snug as the brand claims to be. It fits snug into the plastic part of the case but the outside flap is bowed and loose and not snug. Not the best quality and comes with a big price tag. I wouldn't buy this product if I had noticed that in a store.
1,fits like a glove
1,perfect size.. fast recharge of my phone
1,Has to be charged every night but works well
0,received wrong color but good item
1,It was cute..n fit my phone just perfect...
1,Works great!  Use on in my truck for the kids to connect there gadgets and it has been working well.
1,Its awesome. Worth it.
1,St gigijkju
1,bought this so i can use my phone in the shower. and it works. every single morning. speakerphone even works fine. will purchase more for travel and work. very satisfied.
1,Works great
1,"This charger ROCKS!!! It charges multiple phones faster them my car or wall charger. My husband and spent all day riding a motorcycle, and thanks to this devise, my LG3, his I phone 5 and Samsung (3 phones) were fully charged as we were taking million of pictures.<br />Also being a mom of 2, I am terrified that my phone might die while I am at the store, or can not charge it. Now I have this charges in my purse and no longer worry that my kids or their school wont be able to get a hold of me.<br />Its pretty compact and sturdy.<br />Thinking about buying one for my hubby as he started borrowing mine quite often..."
1,Great item
1,Great emergency solar charger.
1,Arrived in good time.  Works well.  No complaints.
1,I love this case . The clock is beautiful and classy looking . The case is classy looking . I like very much that I can answer the phone or take pictures without opening the case . Can't say enough about it
1,"Orzly protective case for your smartphone<br />A smart, black, modern, light weight case, neatly packaged in a well designed box which visibly highlights the  benefits and suitability of the product.  Easy to open, no extra wasted packaging, simple and well thought through.<br />The box was accessorised with a small booklet containing Orzly products and other bits of interesting information.<br />The Orzly protective case has no buttons or zips but can be opened by simply lifting a magnetic tag, great for those without great manual dexterity!!<br />The inside case houses two pockets, great for credit cards or important bits of information without the need to carry extra wallets or purses around.  The smart phone can easily be slotted into the allocated pocket on the opposite side.<br />An ideal product for those who want a no messing, light weight product, an attractive elegant accessory for the smartphone!!"
-1,Garbage.  Seller finally contacted me after the 4th email to them.  Amazon already refunded me 100 percent so I threw this thing in the trash.  What a waste of time
1,Great product and service.
0,Hard to put on.  I was just glad to find these so I didn't have to replace my whole headset.
1,Its so cute I love it
1,"Each cord is 10 foot long, so you have more than enough room to move around a little bit if you need too. I received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
1,This screen protector is very well made and fits well on my phone. It was simple to apply thanks to the instructions on the box. I have a small bubble but it's barely seen and I'm pretty sure it's due to my error. Overall I'm very pleasedisappointed with this product and am thankful to have something to protect my screen.
1,I definitely would recommend
0,I want to love this holder --- I can't get mine to stick --- on anything in my car!  If i figure it out I will revise my review!
-1,"I've had this case for a while now and it's a complete disappointment. What you start with is a too sticky case that grabs onto lots of stuff that you don't want it to stick too and then that stickiness completely goes away in a little bit, so you end up with an ordinary case worth $8 that you paid $50 for."
-1,"Good afternoon the products have not reached this far, although I have written have not answered"
1,Good for the price
1,"Arrived on time, small area already peeled off. We'll see what happens in a few months."
-1,Fall apart and break on the micro usb side. Do not buy this brand.
1,Very nice i iwll buy it again.
-1,Kept breaking so I would say get the Amazon basics or a braided one.
0,I thought there would be a pair of these sent and it is only one ear piece for your right ear.
1,Great
1,love it
1,Great product great price fast delivery
1,"I buy this case for every phone I get. Not sure why, but it's my absolute favorite case. No matter how many I try, I end up back with this one on."
1,Great sound! iPhone 6 works great with!
0,"The cables that are provided with this batery doesn't work with my phone, so I have my own cable not the one original one. But other than that I works very well."
1,"I would never use anything other than Zeiss on my lenses.  I have used other products and they produce and attract lint, smudge more easily, etc.  Zeiss is the best for me."
1,"Excellent phone, but overpriced here. Got mine (unlocked T-Mobile) at Bestbuy for $119.00. I hear they are very popular and folks can't keep them in stock. Maybe that why the price has gone up. Again, excellent phone.  Bought to replace my aging G3."
-1,"After 20 min of trying to get them to stay in my ear, I gave up and will be sending them back. The leaflet in the box with the &#34;instructions&#34; is of no help either, so I have absolutely no idea if I am even inserting them correctly."
1,love
1,Very goo charger and works as promised charging quicker than other products I've tried.  Highly recommend.
1,So nicely designed and packed that it looks like an Apple product<br />And it works fine
1,Excellent batteries!
1,Works great in our 15 passenger to get the DVD players to work in the back of the van!
1,By far the sturdiest selfie stick I've encountered so far. I'm very pleased with it. It holds the phone (iPhone 6 Plus) VERY tightly!....but it takes the spring loaded holder to its maximum extension in order to hold it so I'll be paying close attention to its durability and wear over time. That is the only concern I have about it at this point and it might not even be an issue at all.
1,"UNU supplied me with this product to evaluate & review here.  Like many review readers, I watch for freely offered merchandise, expecting an outstanding analysis because the reviewer wants more stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, the UNU SUPERAK portable battery is exceptionally nice.  It's 5000kmAh (milliamps - iPhone 6 carries 1,810mAh battery, by contrast the Samsung 6 Edge a 2600mAh, & the Samsung Note 4 a more substantive 3200mAh) capacity, at full charge, can theoretically &#34;recharge&#34; any of the phones mentioned above, some twice.  Chargers like this, whether Anker, a fine maker of portable batteries, or this UNO PORTAPAK, hold a charge a long time, weeks in fact without being topped off.  I like the small charger size, it slips into my back jeans pocket, but with a bulge in that it's 3,75&#34; long...but about an inch wide.  It's more an issue for jeans pockets than a suit coat or purse. Great size in cold weather, multi-zippered coats.  I've already charged from near empty...my Samsung Note 3, and of four LEDs on chargers side (to suggests available charge), 3 of the 4 lamps were out.  That's not bad for the heavy 3200mAh Note 3 battery to filled.<br /><br />Here's the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;·sis·tance. The charging cord which comes with the battery has a standard USB male plug on one side, and a WONDERFUL &#34;piggy-back&#34; arrangement of MICRO USB (Android, etc.) with an attached LIGHTENING interface for someones iPhone. The two tips are attached by a small piece of plastic and always there in whatever flavour you require in the moment.  This feature alone is worth the savings in aggravation of 'whose got a micro cable??? NO...that's for my iPhone!!!.<br /><br />This is especially handy and offsets my uncertainty about charger shape. There is both a MICRO and STANDARD outlet on the end to allow powering and charging options of every sort/device.  This accompanying cord would have been wonderful were in somehow attached to the charger...eliminating the need to carry two things...and a small carry-bag would have been a nice touch as well.<br /><br />But for a very fair price, right here on Amazon when available (which should be shortly - after reviews finish is my guess), and the 5k power and compactness...ADDED to the piggy-back MICRO & LIGHTENING interface availability, you simply cannot lose here.<br /><br />If you have family with both iPhones & Androids...this is a grief saver!d to carry two things...and a small carry-bag would have been a nice touch as well.<br /><br />But for a very fair price, right here on Amazon when available (which should be shortly - after reviews finish is my guess), and the 5k power and compactness...ADDED to the piggy-back MICRO & LIGHTENING interface availability, you simply cannot lose here.<br /><br />If you have family with both iPhones & Androids...this is a grief saver!"
-1,Pictures are blurry.
1,Very pleased with my phone case!
1,thank you
1,"Reliable, fits the car well and made a great mount! Well worth the money I paid for it, does the same job compared to others 3 times the price! It was a little bit hard getting it into the vent at first, but once it clicked, it didn't move anywhere."
1,This is the second jackery bar I purchased. I bought one previously for myself. This was a gift and they loved it!
1,"Cannot beat the price, though the screen is crap and the device can occasionally be sluggish."
-1,"cheap I was very careful and it didn't last even one season of boating. closure fell apart. It did float, but just fell apart after awhile."
-1,Gives no longer use than the stock Samsung battery.
1,great product-fast shipping!
1,This is my second LUVVITT tempered glass screen cover. I dropped my phone (which is not in a fancy case just a rubber-y colored slip) face-first a few feet down onto a cement floor obviously my heart dropped when I picked up my phone and saw the shattered screen. I winced as a peeled off the screen cover but THANK THE PHONE GODS my screen was still perfect. I am a customer for life!<br /><br />Fits my Galaxy S5 Active perfectly.<br /><br />Easy to install. The kit comes with a lens cloth and cleaning wipe. Try to line everything up the first time. My first attempt at applying the screen it attached a little skewed and I peeled it off to re-attach. The corner I used to peel the screen protector off had a air pocket under it for the remainder of the time it was on my phone but the screen protector stayed secure for 5 months until today when I replaced it.
1,Great product!
-1,although copied well tech content was poor; sound and transmission ranked between static and broken morse code. Poor Motorola model
1,Delivered on time. Works much better than the junk ones for $5.
-1,"we tried in a couple of places to program it butt no success, it s &#34;no &#34; for me"
1,love it
-1,"The phone itself fits my phone perfect, but the picture on it isn't the best. You can see the lines from the printer and it's not as clear as I was hoping for."
-1,Product was damaged already when it arrived. Also part was produced poorly because the screen adhesive was already peeling and coming off the display. Very unsatisfied please do not buy from this seller.
-1,I wish i would have read the reviews before buying.  Signal strength is reduced significantly. I cannot return it since I drilled out the bottom so that i could fit a headphone jack.
1,"Bery good, last longer than the original"
1,Very good
1,"I've only used this once so far, but it kept my iPhone dry and allowed me to get some great, clear photos on a white-water rafting trip. Submerged in water, and worked flawlessly. I recommend this product."
0,"Case fits really well, it's slim and comfortable to hold. My biggest complaint is the finish. After about 10 days I noticed the top coat start to chip away and has continued to do so."
1,The best cell phone case I've owned
-1,"Well, my husband had it for less than 24 hours and dropped it and the case shattered."
1,Awesome
1,Can't beat it for the price.
1,"Cords are exactly as advertised, and truly are the perfect size for the DJI Inspire 1 with the factory device mount and the iPad Air 2! A++"
1,"a good phone with affordable price,it works well in my area."
0,Not as advertised.<br /><br />Featured/Sold as &#34;Like New&#34; . Arrived with loose Bezel. Arrived with cheap (Non_Garmin) car power supply that lasted all of one week.  I had to buy a separate car charger to keep it working.<br /><br />The product works but has irritating bias in the on-screen buttons.<br /><br />I would rate this product as &#34;fair&#34; definitely not &#34;like New&#34;
0,"Features were exactly what I was looking for, but after only five months this clear case is now completely yellow! At first I thought I was being hypercritical, but given a few more months it's actually pretty frustrating how much the clear plastic has yellowed. Why aren't more people including this in their reviews?!?"
1,I've had this for a few months and it still looks brand new.
1,I received this battery at no cost for a review but this review will reflect my honest opinion. The battery feels reasonably sturdy and heavy in the hand but not bulky. Having 2 ports to charge with is great and the 2.1 amp port charges really fast. The led flashlight is not that bright but will work in a pinch in a dark area. One thing I wish it had was top usb ports instead of side mount ports. If you were to drop it in a bag you won't be able to charge from a tight compartment because of the side usb ports. These are really trivial things and I don't feel I should knock off a star for it. I would recommend this for a person looking for a week end of charging 2 devices but not much more than that.
1,"Great, bought it for my wife and she loves it. Only down side is the cord it comes with to allow for charging does not fit her iphone 5 (or my 4 for that matter) maybe it is a plug for the iphone 6. Great overall."
1,Great
1,Great case.
1,Arrived quickly and works well.
1,This is a fantastic product and I would recommend it to everyone.  I recieved a promo code for a fair review
0,"While this case may look stunning and come with a stylus, it's texture feels cheap and it had a distressed look within a week from just every day use. The stylus broke the first day I had it, but that probably could have been avoided. Overall it's decent for the price, but if you're looking for something cute AND durable, look elsewhere."
-1,They are not good for gaming.  They &#34;glide&#34; but do not pickup items and move them.  As in &#34;Words with Friends&#34; can't drag letters over.  Sorry that I tried them!!
1,Worked out beautifully for the issue I was having.
1,Good
1,Really nice color i order mint<br />Fits perfectly on my iPhone 6<br />Love the strap :)
1,Delivery was as promised. Charger has been working great.
1,It does the job and the price was right
0,"It's a nice-looking pouch, with good material and lines.  The magnet close works great.  It fits a bare Note 5 very well.  The approach to keeping it from falling off the belt, the clip + snap loop, works pretty well for normal-sized belts, though it needs to have a belt and the loop is really needed -- the clip alone doesn't seem enough to keep the pouch from falling off.  (e.g., I could no longer just clip it on my sport shorts, as I could a Seidio holster, which has a clip with a better mechanism and a lip at the end, which kept it from working its way off)  I had to return the one I received, as the silver Nuoku brand pin in the middle was upside down.  Some may find the three very stiff, thick panels (one in back, one in front, and another in the flap) reassuring, but I found them thicker than I wanted.  They don't really make it bulky, but at least one of those panels could be lost to make the phone easier to handle while giving the same amount of real protection.  The only other thing I found myself wanting was a deeper cutout at the center bottom, to allow me to raise the phone higher with one finger below and grab it above, all with one hand -- I have to use 2 hands to get the phone out."
-1,"Terrible, all broke in less than a week. Not worth the money and irritation."
1,good product i only use the sensor alarm the siren is very loud it will surely make attention if someone will try to take your bike.
1,very good
1,Said estimated delivery date was a month away. Received it in 5 days! Very pleased with product.
1,Great price for a good dependable phone:)
1,They were here on time and they were perfect
1,bought for a friend who really enjoys them for workouts and daily chores.
1,Works and good quality.
0,real look is not WAW
1,As advertised
1,Thank you
-1,Best customer service but cheap make and never last needs to fix it!!!
1,"My 6 Plus fit in here perfectly. I am a short person, when I went to put it on my arm, I discovered it was as long as my arm above the elbow and was uncomfortable because of the size."
1,Daughter loves this.
1,"Best phone case, rugged and hard wearing, fits my iPhone 6 Plus perfect, port covers in the right place, worth the cost."
1,"Hadn't seen this before but I love it.  And, it arrived weeks early!"
0,This was a direct replacement for the original Samsung charger for my Gear S. Only reason I rate it so poorly is it's exactly like the original and that only lasted a few months. This one seems to have the same design flaw and I will probably be purchasing another in a short while after the plastic nubs break off. I'be been exceedingly careful with it too but it appears not to matter. Better than the rubber band solution I was using though.
1,Awesome :)
1,Love this - protects my phone like never before.
1,Excellent case. The quality you would expect from Otterbox!
1,Exactly what I was looking for. Extra protection for an iPhone and cannot even see that it's in place. Highly recommended for protection and to keep fingerprint marks down. A huge step up from the plastic film protectors.
-1,"Did not work, please refund my purchase."
0,"Before ordering this product, I have been using an otter box for many years.  The only draw back about otter box is that the rubber would stretch out overtime and there would be difficulty latching onto the belt clip at the two points on the side.  What I like about the Buddibox is the rubbery feeling that provides a nice grip and the area that latches onto the belt clip is hard plastic.  The draw back about this project is that after using it for about a month, the belt clip broke."
1,Slightly teetery on speaker docks.  Needs back lean support. I'm depending on Velcro
1,Good quality for the price. This is for my work phone so it is carried around all day and stuffed in my pockets. I would reorder.
0,"I really liked this case, but it got dirty easily and it won't clean with any cleaning products."
1,I got this product for free to review it.  I got it when I was supposed to and it's exactly as described.  I got 2 screen protectors and 2 packs of cleaner for them. They seem very durable and fit on my phone.  I recommend!
1,"Works well, great price. Delivered quick"
1,"The LUVVITT® ULTRA ARMOR iPhone 6S Case iPhone 6 case is an awesome case. After having this case for several months, these are the things I have come to find:<br /><br />Fit - 10/10<br />My iPhone 6 fits snugly into the TPU core case. All of the buttons are aligned perfectly onto the case and are immediately accessible should you need to adjust the volume or lock your phone. The hard shell case, which is the outer portion of the case, adds some an additional layer of protection  and fits nicely over the TPU case.<br /><br />Protection - 10/10<br />I personally found the case to be very effective in protecting my phone against my careless/abusive behavior. I'm the type of guy who would throw the phone onto the table immediately after coming home from a long day of work. Not only has it withstood my abuse, but it has also proved its durability against numerous drops. My phone still remains in mint condition, without any scratches, dents, or cracks.<br /><br />Look - 9/10<br />I love the way it looks, and I think its awesome that they provide you multiple colors to choose from. The look is simple and sleek. Not much design on the product, so it might not be for people who like cutesy, flashy phone cases.<br /><br />Price - 11/10<br />For 10 bucks, this thing is easily worth the investment. I normally skimp out on buying any form of protection when it comes to phones, but with these costing an arm and a leg these days, i thought it would be wise to get some sort of case for my phone. I'm glad I went with this case.<br /><br />Overall, this case has proven to be worth the investment. It has kept my phone in pristine condition over the past 7 months and I couldnt be happier. For $10, its hard to beat!"
1,"Great case. Inexpensive, decorative, quite thin.<br />I love it!"
1,"This case fits my phone like a glove.  The cutouts for the buttons are perfectly lined up.  It is a little difficult to get off, but if it was loose it wouldn't fit correctly.  I love the pop of color that it gives my phone!  Shipping was quick and easy.  Perfect transaction all around!  Two thumbs up!<br /><br />I received this product as a free sample for my unbiased opinion."
1,JYZ Thank you so much. I love this case. Omg it feels really good in the hand and the purple color just pops. I made a good choice and the seller was quick with shipping. Over all I'm happy with my case. Also the leather is so shiny. Love it.
1,I ordered one and it didn't work BUT RAVPower was so great about the whole experience and I couldn't be happier with the product I have now.  Recommend.
1,I used the screen for 4 months and it's great. The only thing sometimes the left bottom corner doesn't respond properly.<br />I broke my phone again so I will order another one again.
1,EXCELENTE
0,With the redesign in the Galaxy 5 charging port it can be difficult to get the phone to sit but it does hold the phone upright and does charge once the phone is properly connected
1,I love it. Exactly how I expected.
-1,"The microphone port doesn't work, no one can hear me talk to them. other than that the case is very nice."
1,It works
-1,"I have received it,  at first it fitted my phone and it looked nice however after using my phone for 7 hours i recognized that the touch quality became unfortunately ridiculous and i need to press and hold every button like old phones which made me removed it,  so i paid for two screen protectors and i will not use them."
1,This case is AWESOME!!! Still in perfect shape months later. Easy to clean.
1,I purchased this for my sister for Christmas last year and she loved it so much that I bought it for my son this month.  He especially<br />likes the feature that is a split screen for inner city driving.  It tells you what lane to be and how long until you have to get off the<br />exit ramp.  It makes driving so much easier in heavy traffic when you never know when it is time to exit.  I also like the posted<br />speed limit feature that turns red when you are speeding. This also has lifetime updates on maps.  This is very important if you use<br />the unit often.  My son uses it daily and has thanked me repeatedly.  Great gift idea.  Best GPS on them market!
1,I love it
1,Low price and easy to use
1,This is a very nice heavy charger that two items can be charged at once. This Iflash ISB charger is very sturdy product.  I have bought my share of flimsy car chargers and this one sure looks and feels expensive. My ISB fit smoothly and easily into the slot.  I was given the chance to test this item for an honest opinion.  This is a very nice charger and I am please with the quality.
1,"At the beginning I faced an issue with it, later on I just made a simple restart to the beacon itself and now it's working fine and I tested it many times ... Only one reason for the missing star that the mobile app needs more features.  I recommend this :)"
1,"Barely fits the Nexus 6 in a &#34;SUPCASE Premium Hybrid Bumper Case&#34;, but managed to get it to hold on. Once it's ready, the VR effects are pretty decent, no cross-talk issues at all.<br /><br />Aside from the Nexus 6 in a case barely fitting, what the cardboard makes you realize is that 1440p is still not high resolution enough as you can easily see pixels on the screen :(<br /><br />Using the headstrap will make your nose feel uncomfortable, rubbing against cardboard (literally); you'll want some kind of gel to pad the nose area."
-1,Too flimsy
1,"This case is for people who want a regular case with a stand. Personally, I dislike wallet-style cases, but I need to be able to prop up my phone. This case solved my problems. A few considerations:<br /><br />1. The stand is easy to use, and seems quite sturdy. I don't expect it to fall off or break somehow.<br />2. The case itself is sturdy. It makes the phone feel bigger but that's to be expected.<br /><br />This is a great hybrid between a regular case and wallet case. I was given this case for my objective evaluation."
1,Hard to beat life proof cases and especially for this price.
1,this case fits nice and easy to put on
1,Great product.  Use these in purse and car.
1,"these protect the watch perfectly, love them!"
-1,"I bought two of these in Oct, 2014 for use with my new iPhone 6.  The lightning cables have never worked with my phone, even as I upgraded the OS through the current iOS v8.4.1.  I get the error &#34;This cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone.&#34;  In fact, it does not charge the phone at all.  The charger itself will support other cables (such as the ones sold by Amazon in their Basics line) but the cables included with this unit do NOTHING.  Definitely not happy with this purchase, these were expensive but not worth it!"
-1,rear facing camera will not work I have had 2 replacements and the camera works for a while then it stops
1,"Great little speaker with a powerful sound especially for the cost.  The only thing I'd like more is if it had a longer battery life before needed to be recharged.  Overall, I'm very satisfied."
-1,"I was excited when I bought this because of the convenience.  However, the back of my phone (where tie iQi rests), gets very hot.  I decided not to use it because I don't want it to ruin my phone."
1,Delivery was late but the item works as descrbed.
-1,Did not receive the right case .received a iPhone 6 case needed a note 4
0,Not the right protector for the l u step phone :(
1,"A great device. Elegant, faster, good battery life. Recommended as a mid range phone, yes. Absolutely."
1,For the cost you can't beat these. The earphones came on time and have very good performance both in volume and quality. Unlike the standard Iphone earbuds they stay in your ears!
1,This is a great wireless speaker. I purchased it for my flowershop. I liked the durability of it and knew it would last. The sound is really awesome and it is compact so it fits any where.
1,Worked perfectly!
1,very good case
0,"I bought this for my LG G4 with tempered glass screen protector. It feels sturdy and grips decently, but I noticed that only one half of the lip prevented the screen from touching the floor when inverted. This would've been great without a screen protector."
1,Fits perfectly and is very durable.
1,I bought these 2 pack a couple of months ago. When I received it only 1 was working good. Anker customer service being as Great as they are reimbursed me half for the inconvenience.<br /><br />I say it is a good product all around (compared to others on the market) Tho not the best.<br /><br />The 1 product is still working good no complaints. I would recommend this to others for the price.<br /><br />My rating is as follows:<br />5 stars for Anker customer service.<br />3 stars for the (1 working product I received)<br /><br />For an overall rating of 4 stars!!!
1,"Selfie I love taking pictures wherever I go and I’m glad that I got this selfie stick from Kengadget. There are a lot of selfie sticks out there but for me, by far this product stands out.  It looks more modern and sleek and also it is very well made. I have an Android phone and I did not have any problems pairing my Bluetooth with it. It’s lightweight and so convenient to use. You just have to turn it on, connect your phone with it, flash your perfect smile and click the button to take a picture. I love that it holds up your phone securely and also it has a wrist strap just to secure it in your wrist if you are clumsy like me.  You can extend it just enough to get a perfect group picture or even a nice view. Now I’m looking forward to our next vacation because this selfie stick will surely help in capturing every nice moment perfectly. Disclaimer: I received this as a complimentary product in exchange of my fair feedback."
-1,Did not fit phone!
1,"Excellent quality, far better value than I could find in any of the big stores."
1,Keep the pone very slim - great color - simple and minimalistic which is good. Good feel on the case (doesn't feel slippery). Protects the sides and the back. Buttons are exposed and so is screen so may have issues there - but not too bad and you can always just get a screen protector. Professional packaging as well.
1,Great and cheap replacement and it comes complete. Was surprised to find all you needed. Thanks
1,"Nice slim case but durable material. Has good coverage, extra protection on the corners, but is not bulky at all. Plus the blue dot design hides the flaws/scratches my last clear cover created (not by E LV) but still has clear look that I wanted. With new screen protector my phone looks brand new again!"
1,Love it Color is awesome :) :) :)
0,You get bubbles no matter what
1,Keeps it from sliding.
-1,"Love the look but disappointed.  Thin plastic hard shell cracked along volume buttons within first week after one fall off my lap and onto the floor.  My phone is fine so I guess it did its job, but I would expect more resiliency from a case claiming to be so protective."
1,"I’ve been seeing these all over the news about how these are really popular in Asia and wanted to try one out. This thing is amazing and has revolutionized how we take photos, I LOVE monopods. It arrived in nice blue packaging. This selfie stick is black and works exactly as advertised. You hook up your phone via audiojack and place it in the holder. Click and you’ve taken a pic! Initially, I was worried that it was so light, it was flimsy. But once you put your phone, you realize they did that on purpose and it helps to reduce the weight. Button works perfectly and I like the sleek design. My phone fits well, but I always have my phone in a case, just in case something happens. We took this on a trip and it was so convenient just taking this and my phone, instead of lugging around our DSLR. No more bothering strangers for bad pictures and we can get the whole family in the pic! You might feel funny about using a monopod, but when we went to Europe, everyone was using them because they really are great! Totally recommend!<br />*Honest review for discounted product*"
1,Comparable to Fitbit. Love it.
1,Love the great price!
-1,"Easy to put on, but flimsy.  Even though I thoroughly cleaned the screen several times - once with the spray and each time with the cloth, there were dust particles left by the cloth which could not be removed from the film.  Once I got the film on, it was grainy and made my screen look fuzzy.  I had to take it off completely as I could not see through the dust and fabric leftovers."
1,"Easy installation, my recommendation is to clean the screen, gently place the protector on the screen and carefully move it into position, then when the position is satisfactory press the center to set the adhesive.<br /><br />The clarity is great, and the protector feels nice too. No issues yet, but with screen protectors issues usually don't appear for the first couple of months"
1,"This is an awesome case to have, especially when you are on the beach or in the vacation.It is just what I wanted. I would still recommend to friends and family."
-1,Did not work didnt do anything waste of money
1,This gadget is GREAT!  I use all 6 ports on it.  It charges quickly.
1,"Probably like you, I had never even heard of cubot, but I am now a fan.  PERFORMANCE: Scores about 27500 in the &#34;antutu smartphone benchmark&#34; app (galixy S4 and 'htc one' are at about 26000, galixy S5 is abt 33000)... So it's performance is excellent for the price. I am a multi-tasking fool, and it hasn't let me down yet.  CAMERA: takes excellent pictures and video... It has a Sony cmos camera, works pretty good in low light considering it is a phone. Front cam is better than most. Quality skype calls, outdoor photos, indoor selfies.... it does it all well.  STORAGE: Storage is 16gb (but with micro SD card slot). I found conflicting specs on different sites, some say 32 gb micro sd, a few say 64 gb max... I am using a 64gb, and while my phone work likes the card, I couldn't get it to show quite right using 'mass storage mode' on my pc using the included USB cable. So using the drop down menu on my phone I select &#34;mtp mode&#34; for usb connection, and my pc sees my 64gb card no problem. I have loaded gbs of music to it and it works.  SCREEN: Very vivid color and easy to read, looks high resolution, good side angle viewing too. Screen size is BIG, which I like; if you don't it might not be the phone for you.   IR RADIO: This is a little uncommon, it has an infra red transmitter to be used with the 'ZaZaRemote' app, allowing you to control DVD and blueray players, TVs, AC units, radios, ect... The app has a database of hundreds of common brands and models, with an option to hold your remote up to your phone so it can 'learn' the device. I had limited succes with older DVD, VCR, and entertainment changers, with newer devices it worked pretty good... Except that my vizio's channel and volume contols would trade places in the app.. But yes, on/off control, input change, volume, it works.  SPEAKER: sucks, its quiteish, I like listening to music/audio books/speakerphone calls and its not nearly as loud as say, my iPhone 4s. In cubot's defence, it is a pretty slim phone, not much room for a large speaker  CARRIER: Unlocked is awesome, I ran it for my last week with att's gophone plan, and I just changed to puretalkusa (they lease from att so identical coverage, but more competively priced plans) works on either, or T-Mobile I am told, among many others. It doesn't support LTE (or 4G) to my knowledge, but I'm ok with the 3G internet service in my area. Note: I did have to reconfigure the APN phone data settings for puretalkusa to use Internet on their network, I just googled their settings and typed it into the phone settings, pretty easy.  BATTERY: Not the most impressive, it will last me all day with no problems, but its not amazing. Comparable with other large-screen smartphones.  WATERPROOF: It is IP65 rated, meaning at the time of manufacture it can be held in any direction under a sink for 15 min with no damage... This does not mean that it is necessarily submersible or that you could take it swimming. There are several reviewers on YouTube that show the phone running apps and videos under 5 inches of water... Well, proceed at your own risk. I live in the Pacific Northwest and regularly have to deal with loads of rain, so its basically rainproof :)  INTHEBOX: Comes with a softcase (nice because there isnt a big selection, I found one hardcase online and its still in the mail), and a USB cord ( which had its wires exposed at one end from the white cable sheath, not good, but it works), and a tool to pop open sim and micro sd trays.  OTHER NOTES headphone jack comes out the side, not top or bottom... Weird.. Timezone resets to east coast if on autoset... Might be my carrier? I just set it to 'manual set', no problem. Light on the back is bright, makes a fantastic flashlight, I appreciate the data usage tools so I know what I've got left and that I can set a limit so I can't go over."
1,Worked perfect for 5c through AT&T.  No issues.
1,"If there is one accessory that I think all mobile users should have it’s a USB charger for their car. I personally have three that I keep in my car for various road trips. The first adapter I had only had one port. It was very helpful, but as the need has grown for more ports and more power behind it, so has the market for car chargers. Accessory designer, TYLT, has come up with a rather unique device, the Y-CHARGE [QUIK] Car Charger. It’s a charger that is designed to push more power out to larger devices. For example, the Y-Charge [QUIK] has a 4.7A high powered output. That’s enough power to charge two tablets at their maximum rate. In addition to that, devices that support QuickCharge will charge up to 75% faster than with other chargers.<br /><br />The Y-Charge [QUIK] is also a ‘smart’ charging device. This is a newer class of products that senses your device’s power needs. The charger will then provide the maximum charging rate that is designed to charge your device with. This is very helpful as you don’t have to worry about overcharging or inserting your device’s USB cable into the wrong port.<br />I’ve been a fan of TYLT for quite some time now and have owned many different car chargers. But, I’ve never seen one with such a unique design. As the name suggests, the charger is a ‘Y’. The power adapter end that goes into the cigarette lighter is just a bit longer than most of the other chargers I’ve used. It’s ‘Y’ junction splits into two ports for USB charging. I’ve used other TYLY USB Charging products and found them to be of greater strength that other chargers in the same class and feel that the Y-Charge [QUIK] is no different.<br /><br />The only issue I have with this special charger is its size. And, this may just be because of my usage, but my main cigarette lighter sits just in front of one of my drink holders. Any time I am charging something, it gets in the way of a drink that needs to sit in that holder. This is a very minor issue, but one I felt I needed to address as others might have the same consideration.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful product with a very unique design.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

1,Awesome...very worth it...I luv this product...tnks amazon...hppy customer
1,Great phone!
-1,Radio lasted 2 days and volume control was lost. Radio would be all the way up or all the way down no in between.
-1,It worked for about an hour until it started sounding staticky.  Guess you get what you pay for.
1,Great product.
0,"I was use to a Samsung S4 so I thought they would be the same since they both work with Android. Unfortunately that was not the case. Over all it works but if u have ever used a Samsung, keep it! Also camera is horrible! And the oops protection takes forever to get new phone."
1,Installed with no problems
1,"Nice case - simple, clean and lightweight. It fits the phone very securely, and I haven't noticed that the case hinders the use of any of the controls.  If you are looking for a clear case for your device, this one is very good!"
1,"Great price, fast shipping, product was as advertised. Charger works well for my battery. I will recommend this charger to my friends. Thanks again!"
1,it works very well
1,Love it. More durable than others I have used.
-1,"Absolute garbage. Switches between charging and not charging every second or so, doesn't matter what position the phone is placed, and does this on three different types of phones."
1,Have had install on my boat all spring/summer (about 100 hours water time). So far so good (better than expected and would recommend. Especially for the price.
1,Absolutely beautiful!  My Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 fits perfectly.
1,good product
1,"Good quality blutooth headset ,It can pair with my Iphone very well and fast ."
1,"Fits well, looks good, magnet holds flap closed, price was right. Very happy."
1,love it
-1,Lasted a week before it stopped working.
-1,"Was too big, didn't fit the phone right."
1,"I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion. There are a few things I like about this product one is the digital screen that lets you know the state of your cars battery voltage and how much power is being supplied to your device while it's charging. The other thing that is cool is the head of the device can be maneuvered a little once it is completely plugged in.<br />I have a Samsung Galaxy S5, the speed is not super fast but from 0% battery it can get a full charge  within 1hr30mins - to - 2hrs. It has dual usb ports so you can charge 2 devices at the same time but I only used it for my phone but it is handy to have. When the car is off there is less voltage, so while the car is running it may increase the speed of the charge a little. I would recommend this product if you are concerned about the state of your cars battery."
-1,No protection at all
0,Only attaches to window. Does not work on dashboard.
1,"When I read some of the other reviews, I was worried that the firmware updates might cause some issues for me.  I bought four of these to control the outside lights on my house, and they have been working great for more than a month now.  I think that Belkin has resolved the firmware issues other reviewers talked about, and I have even had them go through a second update (after the initial one that ran at installation) without any issues.  I have had to restart a few of the switches in order to make them reconnect to my router after I changed some settings, but otherwise they have worked very well.  If you are looking for a solid system to begin connecting you lights to your network, these are a great choice.  The added bonus is they are very easy to set up with Amazon Echo.  I simply logged into my Echo app, and built a group with all of my outside lights.  I can easily turn them on or off as a group from my iPhone or by asking Alexa to take care of it for me.  Definitely a step into the future!"
1,Great case.
1,"My iPhone did not come with a charger for my car.  The iPhone battery runs down so fast that I needed something I could use while I was traveling. This not only works great, it is also attractive.  Sure is nice to not have to dig out that ugly bunch of wires to hook up my old one.  I just leave this one plugged in so that is always handy."
1,Looks good and protects well.
1,Slim and unassuming.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Not the most protective but it works for my needs since the 6 plus is such a big phone.
-1,does not fit the edge 6
1,"Love Romero Britto products specially in Amazon, prices are very good"
1,I love this case. I have gotten so many compliments on it.
1,Good product
1,It's great. Love the fit over the phone and the kickstand is excellent
1,This is my third battery (and largest) from Anker.  This battery is very well-made.  It does have a little bit of weight to it but that makes it feels very solid.  Seems to never run out of power.  So far I am very satisfied with this battery and highly recommend it.
1,l love it
1,"Pretty satisfied. Dented the thing with a couple of drops--one between the slats of picnic table right onto concrete (about 28 inches drop, I'd guess). No damage to the phone, so the case did its job as expected. The bulk added is noticeable over the naked phone, but still less bulky than many cases on the market it seems, and the level of protection so far is excellent.<br /><br />The only little quibble: The speaker grill has a thin piece separating two openings to the speaker. This sticks out, and therefore has worn off, revealing a silver/white color underneath. Not sure why they added the ridge, maybe to allow sound out when the phone sits flat? It seems like this same wear will eventually happen to the whole case, but replacing it (maybe refreshing in a new color?) down the line is better than replacing or repairing the phone, obviously"
-1,"I am very sorry I purchased the Nuvi 56 LMT.  The screen glare often reduces the unit to a listen only GPS .If you go on the internet you will see many anti glare hoods being offered to try to fix the problem.  Regretfully I was unaware that such a problem existed.<br />Many common words are mispronounced, e.g. bridge is pronounced as badge  and some street names are so badly pronounced they are beyond recognition.  Unlike my older Garmin unit the Nuvi 56 sometimes has a time lag informing you of the next up coming street name.  This will happen if the distance between the streets is not long enough.  I will using my i Pad mini GPS.  I would not recommend this to anyone at any price."
-1,Very disappointed.  Sometimes doesn't charge both (case & phone).  Sometimes it will not charge and have to remove case to charge iPhone and case separately.
1,Beautiful design and fast shipping!
1,"Love this! Only issue is if you have to take it off so if this is a case that you plan to take on and off, go with something else. But I would buy this again easily. It looks amazing, has protected my phone through countless drops and you can push all the buttons on your phone easily."
-1,charges to 51% now no matter how long. slow. At first it would charge to 97% but it just kept going down
1,Excellent build quality. Nice thick cable. Should last a long time.  Honestly Skiva makes products with excellent quality and attention to detail. Everything from the packaging to the finish on the materials.  Never disappoints!
1,Great for travel!
-1,"Didn't pair or work right, took it in to best buy for help no luck  sent it back"
1,"I've tried several types of mini tripods in the past for phones and webcams and some of the real cheap one are so light and flimsy that they tip over when the wind blows or if you have a USB cable attached they'll just collapse at the slightest change in weight distribution.<br /><br />For this, I was originally looking for a tripod for my point-and-shoot camera and then saw this one that can also be used with my phone.  I haven't used the bluetooth remote feature, but as a tripod alone I feel that this one is plenty sturdy and will not fall over easily.<br /><br />There are probably other decent tripods for half the price I paid for this, but the value in this is it has a phone adapter included.  That being said, the price just went down $5.00 since I bought it! :)"
1,Not the best but it does the job if you dont have BT in your ride.
1,Very comparable to big name products.
1,Fits my Ipod perfectly and I will buy from seller again in the future
1,Good quality charger fits snug to the phone. Only down side was that it was a little short. Does the job perfect.
1,worked great
1,I love being able to sync with multiple devices
1,Good quality product. charges fast.
1,"First time buying a tempered glass for my phone, and this one really surprised me, I don't notice it at all it really feels like touching the screen."
-1,Does not work on my iPhone 6
1,This case was exactly as I expected and works great!
1,good quality and cute
1,its not superfast charger but it is a fast charger
1,"I really love this product... Somehow I always had problems with this type headphones, but this ones fit perfectly, sound is amazing, it does stay when you run..."
1,"This is a top quality charger, and a lifesaver if you don't want your device running out of power.  Its made well, and works well; that's about as good as it gets."
1,"Wonderful people to deal with.<br />I purchased this item and received it. However when I used it, the connector became loose. I wrote a negative review. It was read by the IXCC Customer Support team and they replied to me. They suggest that I return this item and get a replacement. I did just that. The service was great and fast.<br />The new cable appear much better then the first. I believe that I may have received a defective cord in the first order. That happens.<br />Since the service was so great I am giving this FIVE STARS."
1,Emergency iPhone power when you need it.  Nice size and weight.
-1,"Do not order this case!!! It is beyond cheap and it looks like they took a picture of a real Kate spade phone case and blew it up to fit this case. The wording is faded, the product is terrible!!!!! So disappointed"
1,My favorite
0,"Ok, but couldn't get it to stick."
1,"Arrived on time, no issues, well wrapped, Very Happy."
1,"Great price, quick service and fast delivery. Would order again."
1,"Just what I was looking for to carry my Garmin eTrex20, fits well, keeps it a bit safer and secure in my bag."
1,Wonderful
1,AWESOME!
-1,"The tuner in this unit has never worked properly.  I have only been able to tune in 1 station cleanly.  Tech support had no options, other than take it to repair center.  Purchased this M303 along with a XC1410 amp, and both are defective.  The replacement amp has now failed, and again tech support/customer service has no option for me.  I will not be buying Clarion products ever again, poor quality and poor customer service."
1,"it sounds good for music, and the microphone is very good for voice chat."
-1,"the phone was in visually excellent condition, but some how it went through refurbishment without being able to be charged. not very useful without power."
1,Works perfectly... Thanks 😁
1,works fine
0,Fits fine. Could be a little less slippery to hold on the back.
1,I got a otterbox for mine and this for my brothers. It's thinner then the otterbox by far but does a good job of protection on the corners.  My only complaint is I think the rubber should be a little thicker. Those with petite hands my find it very comfortable though.
1,"Heat makes the GPS fall off, so you have to re stick it."
1,"My first bluetooth, and I love it. Why did I not do this a long time ago? Who knows."
1,It is great for the kids in the back where there is only one power port.  With this they can charge their tablets or smart phones on the road.
-1,The screen started breaking on the third day by the home button. I checked to make sure the screen was placed properly and it's not sticking out. Some days later it started crumbling off around the corners... It looks nice but the durability is very low.
-1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF S***! THE BUTTON DOES NOT WORK ! (they have to be paying those people for good feed back) WARNING DO NOT BUY!  AFTER TAKING ONE PICTURE THE BUTTON STOPPED WORKING !
1,Works perfectly. Fits perfectly
-1,"These earbuds were definitely not the right fit for me.  I used these headphones for running, and I could not find the right combination of &#34;wings&#34;, in-ear pieces, and over/under ear positions to make the earbuds stay secure in my ear while doing so.  Besides the fit, pairing, sound, and battery life were all as described, and worked as expected."
-1,"The belt clip is very cheaply made, I've had to order 5 replacement belt clips and won't be buying another"
1,Great product and provides fast charge on the go
1,I love my phone and was looking for a case that would be thin and allow me to stick my phone in my pocket without a lot of bulk or rubber sticking to my pants. This case is pretty (especially on my white phone) and fits perfectly. I'm happy with my purchase.
1,Delivered as promised...on time!
1,"I received this product to provide a fair and honest review<br /><br />This wallet case is quite nice as far as how tightly it fits the phone. The texture of the case is also quite nice.<br /><br />The case is great if you are running to the store to pick up a few things and need to carry your ID and debit card with you, but any more than that and it starts to get a bit tricky. You could not fit several credit cards or business cards or more than a few dollar bills before you have fattened the wallet enough to prevent proper closing.<br /><br />I was very happy with the construction of the case as far as materials used, stitching, color, etc. The only drawback for me was the limits in space available."
1,"This niftyty little Pouch which secures with a snap closure provides everything I need, I wanted a hands-free means of carrying my phone when I'm walking my dog with the leash in one hand and various other items in my other hand  this certainly meets my requirements. It arrived quickly which is always appreciated, it has a separate little area for cash or credit cards and most importantly to me, an adjustable shoulder strap . a separate wrist strap was enclosed as well. Great gadget.  It's light weight I do have a mini droid and this case weighs a little less than the phone. There is more than enough room for my phone this would hold a larger phone Also"
1,"Fast shipping, great product."
1,Fits great
1,The product works as expected.
-1,"Very, very disappointed. Since the beginning having problems with the door you use to charge thei cel. Hard time to keep it close and now it does not close. Looking forward to get my money back."
1,Love the sticker. Put it on my clip on case. Its peeling a little bit and I bought it in May (2015). Nothing a little Modge Podge cant fix.
1,Great phone!
1,"they gave me a free extra charger , amazing"
0,"Don't get me wrong - I like the product so far. It works as indicated - charges the phone and acts as a battery backup for the phone. No problems so far there. But I give the 3 stars because of the email I received from NomadPlus, asking me how I like my product because &#34;your feedback helps us ensure a positive customer experience&#34;.<br /><br />My issue lies with Nomad because the final sentence of my email says, &#34;We love happy nomads, so if you have any questions or issues with your product, please email me at [e-mail address removed] and I'd be glad to help you.&#34;  So I received an email from 'Chloe', and she wants to help me if I have questions, yet there is no email address for me to contact 'Chloe'?!?! Ah, yes, so very helpful. Sorry Chloe (if that's your real name), but I just can't give you 5 stars because of your hollow attempt to ensure I am a happy nomad. Am I being petty? I guess, but don't pay me lip service with your feigned desire to ensure this nomad is happy."
-1,It was the wrong one. It didn't fit
1,It works as advertised.
1,Awesome!!!!!!! Holds a lot of cards and the magnetic cell holder is brilliant.  I use this everyday so that I don't have to lug my wallet.  Everyone one that sees it wants one.
-1,"I bought 6 pairs of radios to use in my business, the radios are well built except for the belt clip, that is too small and easy to brake.<br />My biggest dissapointment is with the clarity of the voice, it is extremely hard to understand anything the other person is saying, much less with the surveillance headset PTT mic, I am really dissapinted with Motorola."
1,"I love the fact that this charger has 6 ports on it. Between tablets and cell phones, we just didn't have enough outlets in the kitchen where we wanted to charge all of our devices so they were easy to remember to grab on our way out of the house each morning. This guy does them all and only uses 1 wall outlet... and all 6 devices charge fast. I have a Charger Doctor device that displays the voltage and current being delivered by a USB port, and I've had the charger loaded up to where it is delivering more than 1 amp from each of the 6 ports (6 amps total) with no problems. I've recommended this to my family and I know they are going to love it as much as I do."
1,This is exactly what I need
1,"This is a 15,000 mah portable battery pack. Just to give you some comparisons, an iphone 6 has 1800 mah, and a nexus 6 has around 3000 mah. So that should give you an idea of how much this should charge your phones. One thing about the current generation of battery packs is that they are &#34;smart&#34; charging, meaning they will slow down charging when it nears a full phone charge.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't have a quick charge phone, but I wish I did because it seems like a nice feature. Fast charging. It is marked by an orange port (like it is on all other Aukey devices). The nexus 6 does have quick charging, but I don't have one unfortunately.  Other than that, the two ports work as normal ports up to 2 amps, which is good for tablets and phablets.<br /><br />15,000 is amazing. I have a 20,000 mah one from another company that is a lot bigger and heavier. This has a built in flashlight as well (like many other battery packs that are on the market).<br /><br />I would recommend using a 2 amp charger, which this battery has, to ensure faster recharge time on the battery pack. at 1 amp, it would be a bit slow. Charging is via a micro usb cable, which is standard with most android phones.<br /><br />Overall, it is a nice, well designed, and functional battery pack that has many uses and is being added to replace some smaller battery packs in my travel arsenal.<br /><br />Item was provided for unbiased review."
1,worth it
-1,The screen protector on this item is horrible. If they fix that portion of the case it's awesome
1,Mounted this to a Victory Jackpot.  Gives great versatility for listening to music or using it as navigation. Holds Iphone 6 (with Case) really well.
1,A little bulky so it's hard to fit in my pocket but it looks great and I don't have to worry about my phone getting beat up.
1,This smart watch worths its money. It makes the same things the other famous watches do. You can connect it via bluetooth with your mobile. It connected without a problem with s4. Receive and make calls.
1,My son loves it!
1,"Due to over 30% of the bad reviews, I was really worried if I made the wrong decision on getting UP2. However, I really like the design of UP2, small, light weight, comfortable to wear and the features (include the app), which helps me to watch my daily activities and hit my exercise goals. Many people complained it does not stay on the wrist well, but mine hasn't had this problem yet. Only one thing needs to be aware, but not a big deal, it sync with my phone every few minutes,so drains the battery really fast. In overall, it is a good tracker worth to give it a try!"
1,Sound is good but doesnt go nearly as far as they claim.
-1,I had them a month and they both quit working:(
1,Great product. It's sturdy and not bulky. I love the buttons to turn each individual port on and off. This is a great car accessory.
0,Does the trick but would rather have the cover itself
-1,There is just one word to describe this product -&#34;Terrible&#34;
-1,had no glue to stick sucks dont buy
1,This is hands down the best glass Protection for an iPhone. I have been using this glass protection for about 2 years. You can't beat the cost or the protection quality ... Great Job...
1,This wristlet is super useful if you're going out with just a phone and your id/credit cards because it's super tiny and you can literally fit it in a pocket or just have it around your wrist.
-1,This things junk! The picker quality sucks! The play the time back doesn't work half the time. The GPS cable  comes out all the time. And it died after three months of us.
1,Great Case very satisfied with product.
1,Love it!
1,Works very well! so nice to know I could fall in the pool or get caught in the rain and no problem!
1,Awesome. Works good and great price.
1,Love it!
1,Great !!!! I drop my iPhone at work I work in a warehouse and the floor is extremely hard. I was so afraid to pick up my phone when I did I saw the screen was shattered but when I remove my Maxboost glass protected I realized it was the screen protector and not my actual phone. Great product to have if you have an iPhone it's a life saver.
1,"Wish the connector plug was three inches longer, as it sits behind the TV and is impossible to hit the sync button unless I move the TV.  Other than that, am pleased."
1,👍🏻
1,"I went without screen protectors for awhile in part because I don't like the way they feel. Then there is dust and air bubbles. The glad feels great compared to plastic. Your fingers slide right over it. A few air bubbles were present after application, but they went away after a few days. The only issue I have with this screen is it doesn't work well with thin TPU cases. The lip of the case pushes the corners up and causes air bubbles."
1,An ultimate band
1,Love the custom option here. Fast shipping too!
1,"I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.<br /><br />This case is very well built. The card holder securely holds my cards - they don't fall out when shaken around. They are also easy to slide out when needed, much easier than removing my ID from my wallet. The inside of the case is a flexible and softer material while the outer white part of the case is hard. I did drop my phone while in this case and it did bounce itself down the stairs -- my phone survived. The buttons on the case are really easy to push in and use. I am very impressed at the quality of this case for the price that it is. Plus I love the fact that I can throw my credit card or cash into it. Will definitely be buying another one for the hubs phone."
-1,Received the phone it had a mark on the screen it's steadily getting worse and that whole spot is unusable the touch screen doesn't work in that spot I have photos. I know this is a refurbished phone but it said it was acceptable and usable this phone is neither of those things. I would like a replacement or at the very least a refund.
1,Recently got back from a domestic flight where we had the opportunity to use the headphones (in green) with our 6 year old. He loved them and even my 3.5 year old (which used his hand-me-down version of some other product) asked if she could use these! They liked how soft they were and I really liked the soft wire connection as well. Highly recommend. Easy to fold and carry in its own carrying bag which made it super easy for traveling. Kids were able to hear portable DVD player just fine over the plane engine (and we were toward the rear of the plane both times).
-1,i bought this a while back....didnt use it much because everyone said it sounded tiny .......i used the mic on a baofeng and a wouxun
1,"Great device! It's everything I expected- Charges up well, charges my phone a few times on a charge, and although slower, the wireless charging works well, even though any case I've tried; but here's the caveat probably specific to my device, Sony Xperia Z3v: Because of the angle of the charger, my phone slides down to a point that it stops charging, only if it is bare with no case or protector. So for the wireless charging to work on a Sony Xperia Z3v, it must at least have a clear protector on it's back, or a case. I guess the tempered glass is too smooth for the rubber of the charger to grip. For this reason, I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, because my device was specifically shown in the listing, but will not wireless charge in it's oem form (without a case or protector)."
1,"Great headphones, my 6yr loves them."
1,Nice Case recomended
1,as orded
1,"Bought from Vendor &#34;Charger City&#34; and it has been working properly for about a month.<br /><br />Proper fit in the Magellan Roadmate 1700: Not too tight and not too loose.<br /><br />Gets a little warm when operating, but the old one might have done that too."
-1,"Not what I expected, waste of money"
-1,There were sctraches on one side. Like it has been used for a year.
1,Love it! Great color and easy to fit on phone.
1,"I've been using these daily for awhile now. So far they've worked better and last longer than the original battery that came with my phone.<br />At this point, I can legitimately recommend these."
1,"Great deal.  Purchased 3.  Only possible negative is that when running, slight rattle coming from the volume button.  Other than that, great sound."
1,Good phone for the price.
1,"I love to change cases frequently and I am very picky about my phone cases. I like them to be thin not bulky. I received the Fab Quality Clear Galaxy S6 Case. I love it. !!<br /><br />So easy to put on and it fits nice and snug with my phone. I like that you can see my phone back and nothing is covered. It is so thin and makes my phone look as if it has no case on it. It is comfortable to grip, it does not feel slippery. I have had others that were for a iPhone 6 and the quality  was not as good. This is strong yet flexible. Precise Design Allows Easy Access to All Ports, Sensors, Speakers, Cameras and All Galaxy S6 Features. Designed Specifically for Samsung Galaxy S6 2015.<br /><br />I will be using this case for a long time because it is so comfortable. I received this case complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own."
1,Excellent product
-1,DISAPPOINTED!!<br /><br />Was glad to receive it the day before my trip. Very disappointed because it didn't charge my phone at all though it was plug in the whole day 😕. Tried to switch from both output but still not working. Going to return it!
1,"Nice cover, fits very snug on tablet and love the design.  Good rotation capability, easy to hold.  Shipped quickly in nice packaging."
1,I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />This case seems very well constructed. It fits easily onto my phone and is very secure. It adds bulk to the phone comparable to any non-otterbox/lifeproof case.<br /><br />I would recommend this.
1,"This is very cute, but the bow kept falling off even though I super glued it back on several times."
1,"Just now coming apart a little here and there. I used it everyday, and the credit card slots are just now stretching out a tad. I would estimate I've had about a year! Very heavy use. I would recommend!!!!"
1,Exactly what I have been needing! Our bed is located in a goofy place in our bedroom and phone charger cords are just a pain to deal with every night before bed! So much easier to just place my phone down and know it's going to be charged by morning!
0,I purchased this clock last year and it worked well but the phone charger broke so my son doesn't want to use the clock anymore.  The ringer isn't loud enough to wake him up and it's right next to him. I was optimistic about purchasing a clock with so many functions.  I went to the dollar store and bought a clock that only has an alarm that rings loud. No bells and whistles.
1,this one works perfectly where others have failed.<br />worth the extra cost.<br />good job monster cable for keeping the old tape decks usable.
1,Fine fit looks good.
1,Nice case and as advertised.  Rated four stars as one of my cables with a thicker end won't work on this case even though it worked on a different case which has since worn out.  Otherwise I'd rate five stars as this is a very nice product for the money.
1,Great deal for the price
0,"Pyramid BNPS102 10-Inch 1,000-Watt... It's ok  ... you get what you pay for this added nice bass  but it has a very flat range where it hits/sounds good  and some of the sub sounds dont even hit at all and the ones that do sound good so you will be listening to a song with a bass line and half of it it quiet  and the other half is way loud  and some beats dont sound right... i have them hooked up to a 1000w boss amp that was about $60 here on amazon...another bumming thing is they dont bump good at all  my honda stereo  goes from 1-40  and they only sound good around 1-13 ... some songs good up to 20  i have played with the amp a lot to try and get it to sound better but they just sound muddy and airy at high volume with hardly any hit  i even turned the amp almost all the way down and it becomes a bit cleaner sounding but it also sounds really weak like you dont have amps  just some really nice 6x9 rear speakers  that do decent bass for not being subs ... now if i only turn volume up to 13 and have the amp at about half power it sounds really nice with most songs aside from some bass lines being much quieter than others .. imo spend a little more and get quality subs like kicker or MTX  or rockford fosgate  or something decent"
-1,Overheats my phone badly.
1,"I bought this for my boyfriend, and he loves it!!!!! It stays charged forever!!! If you play ingess, this is a must have!"
1,"I was skeptical at first because of all the generally negative reviews about this mount.  People say it rattles around a lot while riding and they are worried that it might fall off their bike.  All I can say is that it hasn't happened to me yet.  I have the mount stuck to the back of my Lifeproof'd iPhone 6 plus which is basically like riding around with an iPad on your handle bar!  It seems to be working just fine.  After you lock your device into the mount it holds it pretty good,  there is a little slop but it's nothing major.  I ride 12-15 miles per day on paved bike trails, off road single track stuff, gravel roads etc... Point being I ride without a worry that my phone is going to fall off.  Follow the instructions about applying the adhesive and it will work like it's supposed to.  The mount itself hasn't moved from its original mounting position after about 140 miles of use.  I gave it 4 stars just because it is a little sloppy after its locked into place but like I said before it's not enough for me to be concerned.  Overall I am pretty happy with my purchase and I would recommend this mounting system to a friend."
-1,It was to hard to mess with the buttons. Didn't keep it on at all.
1,Looks good and the reception is significantly better than the original stubby antenna.  No longer hitting every cement beam at work or the airport parking garages with the factory antenna.
-1,Wrong super shieldz.
1,Installed easily. Much less smudging than with the plastic protector I had.
1,"Works great and fast, has a flash light also"
1,Phone works great! My charger that it came with did not. But the phone works perfectly :)
1,"Exactly as expected. Nice, snug fit with a high quality stand on back. The only thing I wish it had is the clear rubber protection cover that came with the original iPhone 5 version so that it can be used in the rain if needed. Otherwise it is good."
1,"Very nice,love that you can put your  license in that secret slot."
1,Nicely built and very slim
1,It is what I expected.  I purchased for my sister so she could pictures in the back.  Works like we thought.
1,"Good product,  we have this near yhe table seems that is where everyone ends up hanging out.  Its worked great so far.  Love little plug with the cord.<br />We use several size usb cords to reach everyone from 3 ,6 ,and a 10 foot one for the person at the end of table.  Seems someone is always needing to charge and this way no one has to play musical chairs to get near a charger. We just keep extra cords put in a little box ypu don't have cords all over the place all the time<br /><br />Im ordering another to put in my bedroom for my 3 devices."
1,"I really like it , but it did not have the silver bird and that was a let down , because I was sold on one thing and received another"
-1,When I press my button the outgoing beep is very loud so loud I have to take it off
1,Ok so far... happy with it
-1,"Worked great for 4 days. Then it wouldn't charge. Every time I tried to charge it, it would reset and just vibrate. Tried to contact the seller, but the language barrier made it all but impossible. Shipped on time and in good condition."
1,"I gave the unit five stars because it did what it claimed to do with one charge on this battery  I charged a cell phone with a 3200 mAh battery and a speaker and I did not deplete the battery, battery pack after the two charges had 62% charge remaining. The only comment I want to make is that the unit has an LED light but there are no instuctions on how to turn the light on, I found if you deprtess the power button twice the light turns on and off. I was sold the unit at a reduced cost for my feed back and if the unit did not live up to its expectation I would not have given it aa good review, however an un it with a battery of this size sells for three times as much in a cell phone store or other electronics retailer."
1,Greatest
1,"The price was great and the earphones do the job, comfortable and good quality."
1,"This is a great little product. I also bought 3 cables when I purchased this charger, and I can charge my phone, backup battery, and bluetooth all at the same time. It's actually remarkably quick too. During my half hour commute, I can get a full charge on my bluetooth, 1/3 of a charge on my backup battery, and 3/4 of a charge on my phone, a Samsung Galaxy S4. Definitely recommend it. Great product, especially for the price."
0,BULBS BLEW 1ST WEEK... ONLY A FEW WORKING
1,I was looking for a case that I could store my CC and DL so I did not have to put them loose in my pocket. This is perfect. It make me feel more confident that my CC and DL will not fall out of my pocket.
1,"I ordered a 2 pack, but they sent me a 4 pack. No complaints here! My wife's phone is buggy and doesn't work with the cheaper cables, but these cables work great! I won't buy from any other source. These cables are a great price and feel sturdy."
1,Awesome case! protects the corners of the phone very well and the kickstand makes handsfree viewing easy.  Wish I hadn't of lost the holster!!
1,Excellent
-1,Garbage
1,This battery fit and functioned very well.
1,Perfect
1,The quality of the craftsmanship is stellar; my favorite part is the cabling along the cord which makes it so flexible. Works perfectly with my iPhone 5s
-1,Crappie it says Cable charging and you have to toggle with the cable in order for it to work.
0,Does its job but doesn't support trickle charge. Also rattles when the phone isn't in there.
1,"Great holding power, I use them with large phones, handheld radios and even my 10 inch Tablet without a problem. You can really bend the arm without a problem and it stays in place!"
1,Works on any device.  Charges rapidly.
-1,Horrible
1,"This SIM card, SIMGLW206R, worked perfectly to activate a Sprint LG G2 on Sprint's network."
0,Plastic cover came off in second day. Other than that works nice
0,Had a very hard time getting the old one out and installing the new one it was really difficult even with the videos on youtube.
1,works well with my iphomes
1,Very accommodating
-1,"It's a waste of money, even for kids. Won't connect to the phone, specially an iphone."
0,"Nice case, good looking, fits great. It's a little slicker than I suspected it would be but it is real wood and so I can take a fine grit sandpaper to give it texture. Fell off my nightstand and there's a crack in it now. Still functional, and it protected the phone perfectly. I'll have to get another at some point because it is cracked but, at this price it's worth it."
1,"This is a great product for those that have multiple USB items to charge.  I travel frequently and this charger save me from having to pack multiple transformers.  It allows me to charge everything (iPhone, Android phone, iPad and LG G watch) in the same area of my hotel room using only one outlet.  The smart power function is great too.  It will not overcharge the batteries and supplies the correct amount of power."
1,My phone fit perfectly into the wallet.  It looks sleek and neat. Would highly recommend.
0,"I used to have a Spigen for my older phone; Note 3, and it was amazing. This one was not as good. After a few weeks it kind of got bigger than the phone, and I was not able to use it. In fairness to them, I have not contacted Spigen about it."
1,Does a great job. Very satisfied.
1,Works and fits perfect.
1,Love it. Very easy to put together.
1,I purchased several of these cords for my family. The cords are very sturdy. The length has become a plus when having an active child. He is always moving and really hard on electronics. This cords has held up really good.
-1,This phone only lasted 1 mo. Then couln't get a refund or credit. Very disappointing!
-1,"the volume button does not work properly. I'm unable to turn the volume up or done as the case and volume button don't seem to line up. Furthermore, I have to remove the prone from the case to charge it as the hole on the case is not the correct size. I have since stopped using the case."
1,"Just receive, seems good."
-1,"I bought one of these for my wife and one for myself back in May and I must say it has not been a good experience.  Our biggest gripe is that the Moto E is EXTREMELY slow.  It is hard to tell what the bottleneck is, but any level of multi-tasking will bring this phone to an absolute crawl.  I typically use Endomondo to track my walking and running while also listening to music stored on my phone with Google Music or streamed with Pandora.  So far I have not yet been able to run both apps without one or both crashing or the phone spontaneously rebooting.  If the phone is updating any of its apps, you might as well sit it down and walk away for a while because it will be mostly unresponsive until the updates are complete.  Switching between apps takes far longer than I would expect from any phone in 2015.  I have tried clearing cache and doing factory resets on both phones several times since we got them but have not seen any improvement in responsiveness.<br /><br />Another extremely annoying issue is that apps moved to the SD card are moved back to the internal storage when they are updated through Google Play.  So, if you plan on moving apps to the SD card in order to save space on the meager internal storage, be prepared to move your apps from internal to SD each time they update.<br /><br />The Moto E isn't all bad though.  The battery life is very good, there is virtually no bloatware and the built quality is very sturdy for a budget phone.  Motorola is also doing a great job keeping their devices on the latest stable version of Android.  I wish I could recommend the latest release of the Moto G over the Moto E, but it has the same CPU and memory bandwidth as the Moto E so I'm concerned that it might be a terrible multi-tasker as well.  I replaced our Moto Es with the Asus Zenfone 2 (purchased here on Amazon for $200) and found it to be a much better performer and better value overall than the Moto E.  Not a surprise really since the Zenfone's CPU is much fasterand it uses much faster RAM."
0,"It is great looking very pretty phone. the edgeless display is awesome and lcd screen is impressive, although it is not the best phone out, force closes apps alot, okay battery life, at times Wifi won't connect to &#34;avoid poor connection&#34; even when the signal strength is excellent, i had to downoad a launcher app to make it more aesthetically pleasing. both cameras are subpar, taking screenshots is pretty cool because all you do is swipe across the top of the phone but when you have the screenshot feature turned on it gets kind of annoying because it makes it hard to get to the settings in the status bar. you can't mute videos on instagram which is a bit of a bummer. For the money i guess I'd get it again despite some of its downfalls"
-1,"Terrible design, the on/off button is on the side which is easily pushed on with a slight bump.. Very hard to carry in purse or pocket. Charge drains frequently w/ode because of this."
-1,Took one charge and that was it. Returning it now
1,Excellent
1,"Solid, simple to opperate & reliable do far"
1,Grest product. Thanks!
-1,Doesnt work on my OnePlus 2 :(
1,Great charger and still works after a couple months unlike most non-Apple chargers. I will definitely buy again when the need arises.
1,Excellent value and provides a lot of protection for the phone.
1,It is protective.  Not the highest quality!
1,had the same case for my note 3 and still love it. as a now iphone user I was so worried about it breaking yet the day I put the case on I dropped it yet nothing happened. couldnt be happier with the purchase
-1,Item has a weird black border and is not very appealing
1,Great fit and not bulky. Great protection.
-1,Makes a buzzing noise on a call.
-1,"I bought this about a year ago. I was initially reluctant to keep it as it seemed Mickey Mouse and fragile. But, what the hell. This was not a cheap holder in terms of price. Well yesterday my initial impression was verified. While driving along the flimsy right phone holder arm broke. I did not even hit a bump. Just driving along and suddenly my phone is in the floor. Evidently the only way this will perform is as a subscription product where you buy a replacement on an annual basis. Don't buy."
1,"for the price, fantastic! only the car charger is a little slow charger not like the original wall charger."
1,Ok
0,Not working USB ports on my Mac at all times. Does work when plugged in with the wall adapter from Apple.
1,Very good selelr.
1,I love it
1,excellent! Thank you
1,This item is a battery saver if I'm in the car. For my apartment I have a 12v DC power supply with a cigarette lighter plug so I can continue to use the radio without worrying about running low on battery power. I have purchased  3 UV-82 radios and so I'll be buying a few more of these Eliminators. I recommend this product to everyone with a car and a UV-82.
0,Purchased because of recommendation from a friend. Does not stick very well to windshield.
1,"I was looking for a duel charger and came across this item. Works great in the car, just as advertised. Would especially recommend for the price point."
1,Just what I wanted. Works well. Great for my walks or when you need hands free.
0,Sturdy case and not as bulky as others that provide equal protection only reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is that i can't leave the case on because the aux cable that i use to plug it into my car won't fit with the case on neither will most of my chargers.  I need to remove the case to plug anything into it which defeats the purpose if half the time i can't keep the case on
-1,I am confused. The next model iPhone has not even been released yet. How can this product already have reviews rating it 5 out of 5 stars? Bit suspicious if you ask me...
1,You get what you pay for
1,excellent product!
1,For the price this is a great product. It's sturdy and easy to use. Nice silicone linig and can still put in headphones without any obstruction. Some are too bulky and u can stick the phone jack in completely. Great product!
1,"Every now and then I let my son help me test products. This was definitely a fun one! I hooked my phone 6 to this selfie stick within a few seconds. You rest your phone on the bottom part of the cell phone holder and pull the top part up using the tap. Once my cell phone fell into the holder I let the tab rest against my phone. Plug it in and you're all ready to go. After letting my almost 2 year old run around with this selfie stick for half an hour, I can promise you two things: your phone does not fall out and this selfie stick is durable as all get out! Another cool feature I found was you can take videos by pushing the button once to begin filming and a second time to turn it off. This really is great for parties and the photos are HILARIOUSLY from a toddlers point of view. I received this selfie stick at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
1,I had read other reviews about this product.  Since I read the negative reviews as well as the positive I was concerned that the case would not fit well or protect the phone.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  The case is extremely well engineered and fits perfectly and should provide excellent protection.
1,I love it.  It looks professional and very well made.  I dropped my phone several times and watched it bounce with no problems.
0,"Nice phone tattoo, but absolutely NO protection!  Of course, I dropped my phone and cracked the screen within a month.  Bleh.  Why can't we have beauty and functionality?"
1,Great quality.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you cannot use the case as a stand like many other similar wallet styles.
1,"Product fits the screen well and looks great. I had an issue with a crack in the screen, but they replaced it immediately for me, and were very nice."
1,Works great. Cord is long enough which is awesome.
1,"The product arrived on time and appears to be the item pictured. It claims to be oleophobic but after only 3 days I already have finger oil stains that will not rub out. That being said, the protector seems to be serving its purpose; I have already dropped the phone once face down from waist height and there was no visible damage. I think a little oil glare is worth the protection factor."
1,This is my review of the Omaker Intelligent 6.6A / 33W Premium Aluminum 3 USB Car Charger With Smart Sharing IC for Each USB Port.<br />Finally! A cigarette lighter USB charger that will fully charge my iPhone 6 AND my MP3 player at the same time! I've wasted $$ trying the ones in the stores and they would charge my phone but NOT my MP3 player (Zune) which requires more power to charge it. Thank God I found this charger. I even have a spare USB port available to charge another device if needed. Do yourself a favor and buy this charger. You'll be very happy with it.
1,"This 6-port USB power outlet solved our dilema of too many devices; not enough outlets.  Perfect for the family room.  We have had four phones and two tablets plugged in at once, and the charger performed flawlessly."
1,"I really like this charger set. It is so nice to be able to plug in my phone and have enough cable to allow the phone to be used in back seat. The charge seems to go quickly, it charges even with navigation on. I have not used it for data transfer but am impressed with all other aspects. I was offered a discount in exchange for my honest review."
1,Love it
1,Works well with iPhone.  Will not charge iPad Air 2 since it is not an Apple certified product.
-1,when you use it the phone have different sound I had to replace my phone from att then I use the case again so the problem is from the case
1,"This is a great phone mount for road bike. I researched many options, and I really appreciate the flexibility of phone size. I have an iPhone 5s in an otter box case. It locks in with no problems."
1,"Just a great thing to have in the car.  Charges a tablet and phone simultaneously while you are driving, seems like decent quality."
-1,Not sure on it .
0,Didn't hold a charge for very long. You'd have to charge the unit then charge your phone.... Might as well charge your phone.
1,So far I really like this case for the money.  I actually dropped my phone and the case did protect it.
1,fits well but not snug like I wish it did. Love the colors and look tho!
1,"Exactly the product I wanted, very good price, received in no time. In fact, I ordered two more."
1,Very Chic
1,"I love my Aapporto Bag!  I use it for dog walking.  It holds everything I need.  ID, credit cards, Note 4 and a few other small items.  It even has room in the back compartment for a small note pad and pen. The quality and construction are good and best of all it fits a 4'10 shetland pony like me, cross body style!  Fortunately it's adjustable for taller folks.  The customer service is excellent too.  Robyn from Aapporto recently sent me an email detailing how to clean the bag of dog hair and lint both of which I have an abundance of.  I do agree with a previous customer who said he would like to see Aapporto make this in a brown waxed canvas style.  If they could do that and keep it in a reasonable price point, I'm sure they could give the Quill and Pad people a definite run for the money."
1,Good fit
1,"This was a great solution to fixing a cracked screen.  Everything went smooth. I would recommend and buy this again, if need be."
0,Suction for window no longer sticks. Has fallen a couple of times while driving. No longer using this due to safety concerns.
1,This is a very functional phone cover. I love the flip cover function of it for protecting your screen. I live the simple white cover to it and that the back is clear showing through it the phone itself. The phone stays put in place nicely The port cutout in the bottom is almost the entire length of the phone so you don't have to worry about chargers not fitting into it while your phone cover is on. I will be using this case for going out to make sure my phone is protected while in my wristlets as it gets hit against things and I like the extra protecting for my screen. I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. That in no way swayed my opinion of this product.
1,All is good with new case and price was excellent.
1,Nice!
-1,"I didn't like it at all. Worst of all, i cant return it."
1,very useful
1,Great phone! Replaced my 4.0
1,"Thank you for such a well functional product. Meets all the expectations! Simple,easy to use! Well put together. Really nice. Will highly recommend it to others! Good work, good product, great service!!! Thanks again!"
1,It fits came in great packaging
1,Great
1,"This is basically my go-to-case when I am doing things outside or the possibility of dropping it a lot. I love the pink and white, something different than most otter boxes. It is very durable, there are some spaces in between the rubber case and hard case, but I am not too picky. It would look nicer if the fit was better, but it protects my phone and that's what it was made for!"
1,Fits like a glove. Spigen always a great product.  Enhances the beauty of the Samsung s6 edge plus.  Barely adds any addition weight to the phone.  I loved It!
1,"I don't have an iPhone so I didn't know if it would work or not. I bought for my sister who was visiting and forgot her iPhone charger. It worked just great. Now that she is home, she is happy to have a spare."
1,"Have had this product for a few days now. It came on time and it plugs into my ihome perfectly. It charges my phone and let's me play music. Although my phone gave me a notification that the device was not recognized, it still works perfectly. I am satisfied with the item for the amount of money I paid (:"
1,The case fits perfect love the red to match all my other red stuff. It feels sturdy and does a good job of still letting you take advantage of the edge
-1,The closure tab became frayed two and half months after purchase.
1,I can't live without this battery case!
0,Glass looks perfect but did not get the adhesive.  Contacted seller to try to get it.  Will update when i have resolution either way.
1,I do not like that there is no place to keep the stylus.
1,Doesn't quite fit with my case
-1,Does not work on all model Toyota trucks.
1,I love it I just wish there was a opening so I can charge my phone with it close
1,"Very nice looking case, seems sturdy good for drops. A little bit hard to put on but that's not all bad, means it won't just fall apart if the phone is dropped or picked up by a 2yr old!! Fits perfectly and feels comfortable. Only bad thing is, the bittons like on/off or volume are a little hard to press. Which they fixed that and make it more like the otterbox. Overall there's nothing that would really deter me from buying another case. Possibly a white one.<br />Bad part....Shipping took a while,  i don't know if that's an amazon issue but ebay definitely has faster free shipping."
1,excelent
-1,it is very cute but I would not buy again. Started falling apart as soon as we started using it.
-1,"So after a misunderstanding on the package i received, and the fast response from the sellers customer service dpt.. i tried the screen protector. There are a few things wrong with the product i received.. 1... the glass doesnt fully cover the screen part of my phone. I understand that it isnt supposed to go to the very edge of the phone, but this doesnt FULLY cover the actual screen. There is about 3/4 millimeters where i can see the original screen. 2... the adhesive doesnt fully adhere all the way to the edge of the screen protector.. there is like a halo around the tempered glass...  If this changes after a day or so, i will update my review on this part. 3.. It is kinda sticky to the touch. Not smooth like your screen is without the protector.<br />I do have to say the Customer Service department was very fast to reply to my concerns, and they did everything they could to help me out. Sorry guys, i tried it and this is my honest opinion. I have had better tempered glass protectors.."
1,Real deal. Charges very quickly.
0,"I use these all the time, though I have trouble pairing them each time a get a new phone."
1,"Of the portable speakers I've tried, this one has the best bass reflex. That is to say, it has the most BALANCED sound - it will vibrate a bit on the table, but will neither rattle things nor emit super-high frequencies that distress your pets. You hear a nice full-ranged sound without too much emphasis on the midrange. It's good enough that I use two daisy-chained ones as the primary stereo sound source for my PSP and several other portable game consoles. It holds a charge for a long time, in or out of use. Even if you don't use it for a month, you can plug it in and it's good to go.<br />One of the best. Better versions may have come out since, but if I ever want another portable speaker, it will probably be the one on this page. It just WORKS and its charging cable, unlike most other speakers', has an inline audio jack.<br />I recommend this portable speaker for indoor/porch/patio. It probably won't hack it at the beach or a party unless it's a quieter day or you have several connected to a LOUD audio source. I've driven it until it clips, though, and it's a musical clipping (sounds good, like old tape, instead of harsh like digital noise)."
1,Great product
-1,Did not work for calls. Wish i had not brought from them
1,Magpul really came through with this one!  The dual durometer material is the product improvement I would of asked for too!
1,"After having bought and used many different ear buds through the years, these are the best I've found for the money.<br />I've had one set for well over a year and they still work perfectly with great sound. I recently bought another set as a backup.<br />I highly recommend these at the under or near $10 price I paid."
-1,"Despite using soap water and window glass cleaner several times, it carries a hazy streaks, blotches . Never looks &#34;crystal clean&#34;; not even for a minute. Otherwise, it's a good  light thin flexible protective case."
-1,Held up for approx 4 months but with normal use holster clip snapped and case broke as well.
1,Works great. Very accurate product description.
1,"I installed my car mount and so far so good! It tends to wobble and twist on a robust pothole or bump but that's a minor inconvenience that I'll get over but the grip itself is very good. I watched the how to video and it was self explanatory and very easy to install. I use it on my Galaxy Note 5 which has a case on it making it a bit thicker and it fits great! I like that I can either clip it to the vent or stick it to the windshield, it's very versatile and easy to switch out."
1,Works great every time.
1,"It arrived quickly, as expected and was exactly what we were needing."
1,Great product
1,Loved it!
0,The product is decent quality and does the job very well. The guide helps to apply the screen protector with ease.
0,I was unhappy with this product. The back is made from a very cheap plastic and started to loose color very quick. The phone just didn't feel protected with this case.
0,I will not fit if you have an Otter box case the plastic part is too wide and it will not insert.
1,Slow shipping but overall good product!
1,Great battery for the price
1,"This works very well.  I installed it following the directions put the case back on, and I have had a clear screen ever since.  The screen protector is invisible and not discernible to the eye.  The only difference that I have detected is that my fingerprint substitute for the passcode to activate my phone now is much more consistent in its effectiveness since I installed the screen protector; but I can see no understandable reason why this should be a cause and effect relationship."
1,"These headphones are great. I've owned a pair for about 3 years and loved them so much that I just ordered another once those kicked the bucket.  Not the best sound, but you can wear them in the car and still hear all the road noise.  That's a selling point for me."
1,Love it. Good quality
0,"I bought this case because of the awesome reviews and it did protect my iPhone 6 plus like it's supposed to but it was irritating that using the touchscreen was very difficult. It was annoying that I had to literally pound on my phone in order to end a phone call. I took the case off a few times and re-positioned it to see if I might have put it on wrong, even had my husband put the case on to make sure we had a good fit but it still didn't work. I'm not going to use it anymore and just find a different case. Disappointing too b/c the price was great."
1,"good battery life and powerful little speaker. holds to my shower well, will not hold on the tile in my shower but on the glass. another good product from NOOT!"
0,The device by itself is fine but it does not hold a Galaxy Note 4 (as specified) with an Otter Box case. does the manufacturer think that you wont use a case? It would possibly fit a smaller case but to me its useless. I could pull the outside case off 2 times a day but that's crazy. I will give it to my girlfriend so not a total lost cause.
1,nice!
-1,"pure crap!  Always remember, you get what you pay for.  Item didn't work out of the package."
1,"What you see is what you get.  Three excellent USB to charge any apple device.  I used one for myself and then the other two will be given to coworkers of mine.  The length of the cord is perfect and is exactly like the one that is given to you when you first buy and iPhone.  This is perfect to keep in the car or to have an extra around the house.<br />Definitely worth the purchase!!<br /><br />I reviewed this item in return for writing a review,"
1,Probably the best kit for the money. I am 100% satisfied.  Even the place that installed the kit was impressed for what was paid. Always go with oxygen free.
1,"The case arrived 12 days earlier then it said it would.<br />I love this case. It fits my phone perfectly and it doesn't block any of the ports. The case is made of a hard plastic, and a soft touch hard plastic on the lighter color so I suspect that even if you drop it your phone won't get damaged.<br />It also came with a tool to open the case and a stylus,  which I wasn't aware of.<br />I tried to pry open the case after it was on around my phone, but it was pretty difficult (this could be a good thing)."
-1,On and off key can't be operative after using this cover.
-1,"It's already cracked within the first few months. I've never had a screen crack with or without a protector, and my phone hasn't gone through any more damage than usual. I think this protector might be a little too rigid and that may be why, but I wouldn't order this again."
1,Ordered the wrong case and Gambolex sent me the right one for no extra charge. They were so good about it that I wouldn't hesitate to order from them again and again in the future. The new case fits my tablet perfectly and looks great. I highly recommend this product!
1,Great !! working without major problems !!
1,So beautifully and conforme
1,I need to send back glass screen protectors
1,"So far so good, it seems to be working for my daughter and she has nothing negative to say, actually compaired to the unit she had before it charges her kindle much faster."
1,This case is good for what it is. It doesn't make the phone bulky like some other cases. Just a heads up that there isn't anything to cover the screen itself with this case.
1,"Excellent small unit that pretty much works as described.  I say &#34;pretty much&#34; only because I had read some reviews that indicated some issues with continuous charging.  I did experience this once, but am not sure that the unit was to blame.  I was charging a cell phone and a smart watch (with wireless charging) over night while on vacation and, one morning, woke up to find neither the watch or the phone charged, and the unit was not working.  I unplugged it and then plugged it right back in the same outlet, and it proceeded to charge fine that morning and then the remaining times I used it.  So, since house I was in was brand new, and since there were no clocks in the room that would be blinking in the event of an electrical outage, I really cannot be sure it was the iClever device.  As a result, I am giving iClever the benefit of the doubt, but giving it 4 stars and not 5.  If I determine that there are any issues, I will update my review."
1,"I am a pretty big power user of my cellphone and it barely lasts a full day even though it is pretty new (Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge), I love my phones ability to charge wirelessly and thought it was about time I got a new battery pack to charge it when i travel without having to have cumbersome cables in my pockets etc.. so I bought one of these. First of all WOW makes life much simpler once i worked out that you have to switch the wireless charging on and off :) (light RED led on, wireless charging on )<br /><br />For a device with 10000mAh it is pretty compact in size and is constructed to a similar standard to most cellphones in that it may or may not survive being dropped on concrete but I am not going to test the theory.<br /><br />Also, using the accompanying cable allows me to quick charge (at 2.1Amps) 2 other devices that use either Apple port or USB. This worked great on a long flight when I had forgotten to charge my iPad.<br /><br />Basically this works great!"
0,"The description is messy and doesn't state that 4G is different from country to country. This phone is not for European market cause most of the Europe works at bands 3, 7, 20, which this phone misses. The description looks like there should be no difference though should have mentioned it."
1,I am giving these a 4 star rating because all of my other wireless Bluetooth headphones never stay in my ears when I'm working out but these do! I love the color too! My only complaint is that my particular headphones are in Japanese or Chinese (sorry I'm not sure which one). I also received an instruction manual for a different version of the PECHAM Bluetooth headphones. See pic.
1,i love this case so much. I've always bought dandy classes for my iPhone 5 this is my first one for my iPhone 6 plus and it's the prettiest one by far!!! I loveeee this cases!! Great buy I highly recommend them to anyone and everyone
1,"One of the best cases I've abused yet. The aluminum alloy bumper gives it a great unique look and is solid impact absorption. I've dropped twice right on the corner, once getting out of the car with it on my lap, another time it was slapped out of my hand into the sidewalk by a drunken friend. Both times the frame bent and warped a little but the phone is still pristine, not even a smudge thanks to the rubber case that goes under the bumper.<br /><br />The rubber case is amazing too, it sticks out a tiny bit on the front, so if you're like me and like to rest your phone face down, it will never touch the screen on an even surface. Backside has a nice pattern and provides solid grip.<br /><br />The charge port and headset port give ample room for non Apple connectors that might not be a petite.<br /><br />Can't go wrong with one!"
1,Smudge proof. I haven't had a single problem. I can't see scratches either. I'm very pleased with this screen protector.
1,Good
1,"Great screen protector. It comes with everything you need for installation, which is pretty simple. Though, there were a few air bubbles that were somewhat difficult to remove, but we got most of them. And there  was no debris stuck underneath.  The screen protector fits well and lines up well, but it doesn't quite reach the edges. That's really the only thing I didn't like about the protector. There is too much unprotected space on the edges. Though my case does cover a good amount of that space.The best thing is the anti-shatter film and the coating really does prevent finger prints. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
1,Nice cover and it can hold a couple credit cards. I have received several compliments on this cover.
1,Awesome
1,This is the best TPU case I have even seen.  Very good quality.  The fit is awesome.  Very tight and sturdy.  The bumps for power/volume has bit different texture which is super nice.  The color is vibrant and really nice.  Makes my whilte colored phone look super good.<br /><br />I highly recommend this case.  Just really nice.
-1,This case does not allow one to listen to headphones while it is clipped to your belt. you have to leave the flap open. I do not recommend.
1,Sorry for the late review. I just figured out how to use this phone. Thank u for the speedy delivery and the awesome phone case!
1,great
1,"Got this for my boyfriend and he loves it, Hold credit cards and his ID."
-1,not what I was looking for
1,"very protective, feels great, just a little bit heavy. very well made."
1,"I started having issues with cheaper lightning cables not charging my iPhone 5S, or my wife's iPhone 6.  So I tried the Apple MFi Certified ones.  So far they are working great!"
-1,Took it on a road trip in the middle of the summer and I guess the heat was too much for the plastic so it broke and fell right off my windshield while I was driving. Only used it 3 times before it broke.
1,"Solid construction. Had a problem sliding the case open to use the phone in hot weather - very difficult to slide.<br />As a result, I purchased another case of a different type."
1,So far it is looking great. Fits my tablet good and helps me hold on to it. Very thin so keeps tablet feeling thin and light. Would buy another cover in a different color if I ever want to have a change.
1,Excellent product!
1,works good
1,"I have really liked this case. I love not having to carry a wallet and my phone. I wish it could hold more cards. I tried to put a few more in and it pushed too hard on the screen. You definitely have to keep it to a minimum. I read a lot of reviews saying it seemed cheap, but I thought it was pretty nice. I am kind of hard on phones and my kids like to use them too and this has held up great for me. I have had it for a while and I have had nothing fall apart or break.  I can access all of the buttons easily. I have dropped my phone a few times and it seemed to have protected it pretty well....no cracked screens yet."
1,easy to use and worth the price
-1,2 big 4 my 15 in box
1,Honestly don't get why everyone is saying it does t work. I had someone who knows what they are doing repair mine and it was just fine
1,The reasons I didn't give them 5 stars is that I would like to see smaller buds or wrap around ear hooks.
1,Worked perfectly
-1,Was nothing like the description.  The strap was extremely long-must be for a six+ person.  Won't be using it.  Very disappointed.
-1,I'm just giving it one star for the COLOR .. I dropped my phone ONCE and the case cracked in three places and it wasn't even a deep fall .. not even a 2ft jump .. I literally just had my phone case for three days and it's already broken ..
1,Love the case. Very protective
1,I really like this style case.
1,I've gotten lots of compliments on it and it fits nicely. I'm obsessed with Dalí and it makes a good ice breaker.
-1,Broke the very first day of normal use.  The suction cup completely broke off the body.  Very poorly made.
1,excellent
1,it has a hard time understanding voice commands so I always type in address I want. Other than that works good
-1,"Not completely happy with the merchandise. The size is suppose to be for my phone, but it's off on the side and bottom. I need to change the one that I put on my phone because of the film build up and I just purchased them.."
1,good product
1,Well Working
-1,Cheap Case Just A Sticker Printed On Nothing Like A Sole Very Upset Waited 3 Weeks For This Garbage
1,"Sleek and beautifully designed. I'm traveling overseas and want to bring along extra charge power. I've charged it, but not yet used it to charge my phone."
1,Good price for a great product. On a partially sunny day this panel charged my Galaxy S5 from 25% to 60% in less than 2 hours. I will be getting another for my bug out bag.
-1,"Honestly, I'm pretty disappointed with this case especially for the price I paid for it (around $20 including the shipping costs). It looked really nice to begin with and then started peeling and scratching within a few weeks and the thin plastic near the volume buttons cracked off. I've had cheaper cases that lasted far longer"
1,My husband needed smooth case for ease of slipping the phone in and out of his pocket.  This was great.
1,"High quality, smudge resistant & strong. Shipping was quick, too!"
1,"Love this case! I wanted a very thin case to protect my phone as well as let the beauty of my phone still show through. You can't really tell when this case is on, it's that thin. My phone has fallen 3-4 times tops, from maybe 4 feet high and not a single scratch on my phone. Gets no bubbles when on and helps resist finger marks."
0,When I first received my GPS I was excited.  Now not so much.  It is just not working well.  Having a hard time.
1,"Great, Great, Great"
1,"I bought this phone from &#34;232Tech&#34;, they get 4 stars because I order a &#34;Black&#34; model and instead, I got the &#34;White&#34; model.<br /><br />So far, the product meets the expectation... a simple Android-based to keep Grandma in touch via Skype and WhatsApp."
1,Perfect love it
0,"The sleep recorder is a bit erratic<br />The emphasis is all on steps, at the expense of eg bicycle or kayak, without a proper conversion of effort, which should be the main feature, not just steps.<br />Worth persevering with though"
1,"This headset are great! I have been using them for a few days now and I am really liking it. The build quality is good, with the rubber being very durable which is hard to find these days. The sound isolation is great whether you're listening to music, or watching a movie on the plane. The microphone is not really up to par, as it doesnt sound the best, but I wouldn't hold it against this. With that being said, these aren't too expensive, so I would totaly recommend these to friends."
1,Funky and good protection for the phone.
1,"The camera is not working.  After installation, you can only see lines as picture attached. No option to contact seller after purchase.  Edited: Camera worked after connecting the power to the head unit.  Tail lights don't provide the full 12 volts and the camera needs 12 volts to work properly."
1,I haven't dropped my iPhone yet but my wife and I each bought one and we are very happy with the quality.
1,Very very very much satisfied.
1,"This is and will be the only case I put on my G6. I love this case its strong and sleek. I have dropped my phone 3 times since owning it and I have not noticed any cracks on my phone nor on the case! I got stickers and put one on each backing and switch them out each week. I love the gold, silver, and slate color. The phone fits perfect in all my pockets. Geez I can't say how awesome this case is!!!"
0,"Functional enough to see the phone for Google Maps, but not so great on hot days. Great for keeping the phone cool, however not so great for driver and passengers. Didn't cool off the car fast enough, because it blocked of one a the middle air vents."
1,Look great but it easily gets scratch.
1,They are great.  I now have a charger at work and a long enough one next to my bed.
-1,"Case is cool, but not great durablity. I haven't used it much, but it is nice for someone who would rarely use their phone and wanted a slim protective barrier."
1,EXCELENTE
1,"I am always getting bored with my phone cases, so I'm always trying new ones. This one caught my eye right away with it's bright green color (my favorite) and black trim. The black trim actually provides a nice gripping material to hold my phone. It was nicely packaged and very easy to put on my phone. It seems very sturdy as well, which is always a plus. It isn't very thick, so it does not add a lot of weight/thickness to my phone. Its bright color let's me easily find it in my huge purse, too! :) I would definitely buy again.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review. All comments and opinions are my own."
1,"Installed easy, and nice clarity. Very happy. Haven't had any drops on the phone yet to report how well it works."
1,Very pleased with the battery.
1,Everything ok
1,"Very discreet--the most visibly subtle Bluetooth headset I have seen--James Bond will be buying one of these. I can hear well, and the person I speak to also said they can hear me clearly. I just received it, so I will continue to test on more phone calls. I will update my review if anything changes."
1,It charged my Note and iPhone with no problem.  Great when you need an extra charging port in your car.<br /><br />I received this sample in exchange for an unbiased review.
1,good
0,Decent product.
-1,Received cable 4/15. A short time later the end piece had to placed in a specific way in order to charge my phone. Cable completely stopped working 8/30. cable looks nice and seems to be heavy duty but nah.
-1,Broke down after a few weeks
1,"The LEVIN Waterproof case is exactly as depicted in the photos and described in the sales promo. It is sturdy, made of ultralight hard PC plastic and Glass Screen Protector that works flawlessly with iPhone 6 Touch ID. The case weighs 1.64 oz/ 47.5 grams and is 0.4&#34;/12mm thick. The granular surface is slip-proof. All ports, buttons and controls align perfectly and are accessible. Package contains the case, an audio extension cable, a microfiber tissue and user manual. Setup is easy and intuitive.<br /><br />I tested the case by placing tissue paper inside it and fully immersed it overnight in a sink full of water. The results confirmed that the LEVIN case is indeed waterproof, there were no leaks, and all tissue contents were dry.<br />Charger port only fits the original Apple jack. The audio port requires an extension (provided).<br />With the phone inside the case, sound quality is excellent. No damping or muffling.<br /><br />I took my iPhone 6 (inside the case) with me on a boat ride this weekend and, for the first time, did not need to put it in a cumbersome plastic locking &#34;waterproof &#34; through which one cannot dial, answer a call or take a picture - all of which I was able to do easily with the LEVIN Waterproof case.<br />I really like it and shall keep my phone well protected inside this case.<br /><br />I received a coupon to purchase this item, but with no obligation to write a review. This is not a barter deal. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees."
1,Best cell phone case.  Only improvement I would like is a latch so you could lock the phone int.
1,The case works fine and seems to be very durable
1,Not much to say.  It's a 12-inch SAE to USB cord so you can charge devices with a USB cord.
0,It works fine but one of the orange/red plastic holders keeps fallig off
-1,"horrible quality, very disappointed in this. Donated to good will"
1,Very good
1,The Camera works great! The cameraI was shipped on time. I love this camera and I also love the price!
0,To short ground wire
1,Received this as a gift.  Phone attaches quickly and easily and feels secure. Only complaint is the telescoping pole is pretty stiff and takes muscle to push in and pull out.
1,"I LOVE this case! It is not bulky like other cases, so you can still show off the thin-ness and beauty of your phone while protecting it at the same time. What I love most is the kick-stand on the back. It makes for easy propping of my phone when my daughter is using it to watch a video. While this case IS NOT waterproof, it is shockproof, so if you drop your phone from average heights, the case absorbs the impact pretty well. This case fits on perfectly with my current screen protector as well, so that is always a plus! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
-1,"A worst product, poor sound quality, the Bluetooth is not supported with many devices. I returned it."
1,"Recieved in turn for an honest reveiw.<br />The case is very sturdy, and all the ports and buttons align and work very well.<br />I love the fact that the covers for the charger port, aux port and the silence button on the side fit very nicely and do not come loose.<br /><br />Only thing that I notice which is not to big of a deal for me is the screen protector that is attached to the case.<br />My screen protector shows like an oily pattern when the screen is off.<br />Slightly visible when screen is on low brightness."
1,Good
1,Great product....love it & arrived much sooner than stated......
1,Was looking for bluetooth sport headphones...considered beats but didn't want to pay the price. Saw these and the reviews and I was sold. These were a steal a $18!! Ended up ordering some for my wife and a co-worker
0,Micro USB ends die quick.  Not much use out of them before they bend. 3 stars for price
1,Fast delivery...just as described.
1,Excellent product
-1,It takes you the long way around. Pretty much of the time....<br />I'd wouldn't sell it to my worst enemy!
1,"Very nice case, but clasp magnetic not strong enough to handle my cc additive and money.  Had to return, but sorry to have to do so."
1,Nice screen protector.
1,GOOD STUFF
1,"The sound is great, and I don't get any complaints from the person on the other end. The earpiece that came with it didn't fit my ear well and I couldn't hear with it, so I used a yurbud piece to put over it instead. Now it's perfect for me! I like how easy it is to use, and the battery life seems to last for a while. Great headset!"
1,Easy to use.
1,Worked to my expectations.
0,In general it is a good case. However within the two days of use the red polka dot color began to come off from the strap. All other designs are still in prestine condition.
-1,The glass bubbled between both of the iphones and screen. We were not able to seal it or reset the glass.
1,This is a great case.  I love that it is fully enclosed with a built-in screen protector.  No problems with tactile sensitivity or anything else on the screen after almost 2 months of using it.  Protects really well and is a very nice looking case.
1,"I had begun dropping my iPhone more regularly lately and was looking for a more sturdy case, but I didn't want something too overwhelming.<br /><br />The i-Blason case fits my needs perfectly. It is reasonably priced, goes on very snugly and doesn't interfere with my use of the phone.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend it."
1,"Compact size and work well. Also, shipping was very fast."
1,"Its pretty easy to assemble and works well as expected. There's nothing much that can go wrong when its just cardboard.Compare with Oculus. Its economical, mobile and works. There might be implications for cost effective VR uses in education as well as showing a mock up of a 3D model to a client without using bulky equipment."
-1,They were able to synch with the car DVD but the volume was terrible!!
1,"works well, unfortunately my ears are too small for it, but it does work."
1,Excellent product!!!
1,"The sound is good, a little muffled for my taste but good enough for training. However, for me personally I found them painful to put on more than an hour. Thus, I took one star out.<br /><br />Other than that the battery life is as described, switching between devices is a breeze, very light you can hardly feel them while training."
1,"Nice simple case, very protective back.  The rubber around the outside is a little tough making it a struggle to press the power button, but it's gotten more flexible over time."
1,Great case. Fits really well and comes with screen protector. I like the design and even though case is only a bumper all the buttons work perfectly. My phone color is Gold so it matches prefect. I am very happy to get this at discount price.
1,This 5.5 is kicking no problem family member no complain everybody is happy I am happy thank you keep up the good work Mr blu
1,"I received a good product, I recommend it for novice users who want to start with smart phones."
1,Great
1,"I've used Spigen Slim Armor cases on my last couple of devices, and recommend them to everyone that asks about my case.  Great fit and finish, adn the kickstand is a nice touch.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a better case, and with Amazon's pricing, you can't go wrong."
1,Battery life not as expected. everything else is great.
1,"I love it, is everything I expected...  :)"
1,good
1,I used it until the new Grinch cover came in. Will start to use it after the first of the year. Well made and good protection for your phone
1,"Been a big fan of all Anker products and this one is great as well.  Just be careful if a blinding blue LED light bothers you. Customer service is top notch, will continue to buy anker."
1,I love it can carry everything I need in it.
1,Pleased with this case.
1,Does it's job well.
1,Great durable case.
-1,"Fell apart the first time I used it. The white part just fell to the floor in pieces leaving the cord silver. Also the neck,  where the cord meets the head, is frail. As of someone started to cut it off! It works though."
1,great product
1,"Love it. Fit perfect, color is great."
1,Works just as described. Easy to apply.
1,good
1,Good product fast shipping
1,"Great Product, easy to use and sounds great. Would buy again."
0,Thought item would be less pliable but protects watch well
-1,Magnet not stong enough to hold phone in it well enough.
1,I was very satisfied with this product and I was more than satisfied with its delivery because it came earlier than I expected it to.
0,The mesh seems to be more durable than the black rubber tips.
1,It is just like the factory one I lost.
1,Worx.
1,Great product!  Arrived on time
1,"Bought this for my husbands phone.  Love the cradle, but it's hard to snap in and out.  I figure it will loosen with time.  Had my iPhone in the same  case and slipped in a pool of mud (in the dark).  The phone went in the mud and it was totally protected, especially at the bottom.  That sold me."
1,Exactly what I ordered and expected. Thanks.
0,"This case works well as a belt clip, but there are too many design flaws with the case. When the phone is in the case you can't push the down volume button. The sticker on the inside of the case started coming up within one month of use from getting the phone out of the case."
1,Perfect fit. Looks nice a sleek.
-1,"No problems at first. Wish the rear camera had a better image, seems a little cheap, cannot see at night (added brighter lights to my truck for backing up). Front camera is great, good HD quality.  Worked for about 8 months, now it will not turn on. Tried to contact supplier with no luck."
-1,It didn't fit right it was making my phone take a lot of photos 😡
-1,Too much static
1,Excelent!!!!
1,Great
1,"Love this product!! Not only will it protect your whole screen from cracking, but it somehow keeps the screen less oily.  I love the feel of it when I'm typing and  makes it easier for me."
1,"I love the 10 foot cable, 😄"
1,Works great
-1,"The wall charger advertises a capacity of 600mAh. I thought this would be great for giving my smartphone a small boost after the wall charger is unplugged. However, there is no 600mAh inside the charger - it is just a plain wall charger with no capacity reserve. Disappointing and not as described."
1,"Everything & more, better than otterbox which I had prior."
-1,"Cannot find a cover for it anywhere, hard to text with long finger nails and it froze when speaking to rep at Tracfone and now lost all my contacts and pictures of my grandkids, lost everything on the phone! It is being replaced by Tracfone but information on the phone is gone,"
1,"Works well but announces &#34;connected&#34; VERY loudly so be sure not to put in the ear buds until a couple minutes go by! I have had people tell me they can't hear me so well on these. However, other times, I have phoncalls without problems. Overall, recommend."
1,Love it
1,great
-1,"The case itself cracked very quickly, and popped off my phone, and the rubber part around the camera lens hole popped off too. It's okay, but wouldn't get it again. I switched it out maybe 6 months after buying this."
1,I bought this to hold an iPad Air 2 in a Lifeproof case. It works perfectly.
1,"The case is wonderful, I get compliments on it all the time . I tell them I got it on Amazon. It's working out excellent for meI would suggest anyone buy this type of case if you carry your phone in your pocket"
1,Da best
0,"Setup is easy and comfort is pretty good, but the sounds is pretty bad. Super heavy on the bass to the point that any music or voice (i.e., podcasts) are very muffled sounding. The in-line mic/control piece is pretty awkward/bulky as well, but I guess they need somewhere to put the battery :)<br /><br />The price probably reflects what you should expect out of these, but if you're looking for more long-term headphones, I'd either wait for better technology or spend some more on a name brand."
1,"Use this in my kayak for fishing/paddling trips all the time.  works great!  no issue with occasional water splashing or the like.  Charges the iPhone pretty well but will use a lot of the speakers battery for that, just FYI.<br />Just spent 3 full 10-16 hour days tearing off and re-roofing my house and this speaker was playing the entire day (on about 1/2 volume) non-stop each day. I did recharge each night but the fact that it can go 12+ hours on one charge at a decent volume is very impressive.  Sound is great too if its not at 100% volume (no speaker I've used sounds good at that level)."
-1,the metal clamps will scratch up your vents. I've used it for only a short period then stopped.
-1,"Broke within one week, was replaced by Amazon and has been working since (about 3 weeks). Does not seem to be the same quality as Apple, though."
-1,"The edges don't lie flat on the phone. The screen immediately got dust under all the edges. Didn't last more than maybe a few months. They should just make it smaller, so it lies flat. I bought a new one by a different company, and it lies flat."
0,Made pictures cloudy.
1,Love this case! So lightweight and lots of colors to choose from! Tempered glass is amazing!
-1,"I saw the previous reviews and was very excited to use this product. When I was trying to do a rough fit on my phone was confused because this screen protector was simply not fitting on my M9. A quick look at the box solved this problem. &#34;Compatible with Amazon Fire Phone&#34;. No problem, just let amazon know they gave me the wrong product, with comments that the box was for an &#34;Amazon Fire Phone&#34;. Couple days later, same issue. Does no one look at comments? Don't waste your time with Volt."
1,Charges the phone very quickly in the car
1,Love it<br />Works great for my needs
1,I am extremely pleased with the product!  An excellent accessory for my cell phone!
1,"Simple to use, accurate.  Has courses pre-loaded.  Uses buttons instead of touch screen."
1,good
1,"Functions perfectly, although sometimes hearing it becomes difficult becuase the sound is not clear enough it should have more volume"
1,Love my new case!!
1,Love the watch.....
-1,"Very cheap copy of the apple adapter.  Lasted less than a month.  When I got around to trying to return it, it was too late."
1,This product will absolutely keep water out.  Sometimes when opening water droplets do get dropped inside and remain inside however it never damaged my phone.  I kept a paper towel inside to absorb all the droplets which worked.  I was not however able to use this product underwater as the touch screen does not respond when the phone is underwater so no underwater images unfortunately.  Adapts to almost any phone and very easy to use.  I also love the strap which allowed me to wear the phone around my neck.
1,Used it two weeks here in the US and a week in Germany. Worked just great.
-1,No protection. Only good when your trying to watch movies at work.
1,I now have two of these switches. Easy to install and the app is great.  I love the integration with ifttt.  I schedule the front porch light to automatically turn on at sundown and turn off two hours later.  Great smart switch!
1,Really nice battery pack. My phone is around 3000 mAh and it gets 3 full charges so I am going to assume that it is truly a 10000 mAh battery.
1,"Buy this right now! If you don't love it, I'd love to know why. This thing is the best one out there and i've tried and had to throw out 4 cell phone holders already because they were total garbage. This one is the best! It suctions to the wind shield like crazy. It has not fallen off once in the few months i've had it. Not even remotely loose. Snug as anything on there. And, there are multiple ways to adjust the arm; towards you, away from you, right left, up, down. The phone can either sit on the little ledge at the bottom and then is ratcheted in tight on the sides with the braces or if you have your phone plugged into the car charger you can just flip up that little bottom ledge so it's not in the way and just use the side braces. It's so easy and fits snug. My phone has not accidentally fallen out of this thing even once and there are no little rubber parts or foam parts that can melt off due to the heat melting the glue. (i've had ones in the past that had these). This is all plastic and it's perfection! I want to buy 2 more just to keep on hand in case the thing does break somewhere down the line. I can't live without this thing in my car."
1,"Great sound, good battery life.  You need a FM station with no signal but if you do definitely pick up!"
1,Fit the 5C perfect great case
1,Works great and stores all the necessary items
1,"Great product, very comfortable to wear and very easy to configure, after pairing for the first time it connects super fast, I just have to turn the headset on and that`s it. I have asked people that I have called on how is the quality of the audio and they says that it is very clear I can hear them very clear as well. Shipping was super fast and I definitely recommend. great product for the price."
-1,"It may take you a few minutes, but do yourself a favor and read all the reviews for this product. I assure you it will be entertaining, but more importantly I'm sure you'll agree that at least half of them are fake! I had a good laugh, but I won't be purchasing this product."
1,Great product and fast service<br /> Looks good on my wife's phone .
1,"USB cables vary in quality in a few important ways, with the most important being the quality of the connectors and the stiffness of the cable.  Stiff cables tend to break more easily than flexible ones, and poorly constructed connectors can make a cable stop working within a few uses.  The cable on this MYOHO version is flexible, if a bit thin, and the connectors are well constructed.  I would expect more from an expensive cable, but it is a good value at this price.  I will update my review if the cable breaks prematurely.<br /><br />Thank you to the company for a review unit."
1,"Just as described, no defects whatsoever! Will buy from you again!"
-1,It was fine now I don't work at all
1,Excellent accessory.
-1,Not appropriate for cell Blu 4.5 camera opening located in the wrong area!
1,"Weighs a little more than I expected & isn't as compact.  However, it holds a charge & does the trick. Nice to have away from any other way to charge things."
1,I've bought other &#34;lightning&#34; cables in the past...but these are the real deal!  Can't get over how fast it charges my phone!  Cable quality and the 10' length are fantastic.
0,China stuff
-1,Item arrived after expected date. The item is cheaply made not worth the long wait that it takes to get to you. I have no idea if it is actually water proof because I'm not willing to take the chance and test it. Buy at your own risk.
1,great
1,Works great. Easily to do if u knw how to follow directions. I followed a YouTube video. Installed in less than 30 and works great.
-1,Unfortunately it didn't work with my Galaxy S4 phone; so I had to return it. Instead I purchased the Samsung S4 battery case with the wireless receiver already attached and it works like a charm!
1,Using with Ram Tough Claw to mount GPS in RZR side x Side - working great and holds Nuvi very snuggly while riding rough trails and roads. This unit will definitely not come loose.
1,"Very good quality, excellent fit of the phone into the holder. Looks very good, like leather and more durable"
-1,"The product is OK, but it squeezes against my ears so tight that I cannot wear it for more than 10 minutes.  Not a good design.  Don't buy this headset unless you have a tiny head."
1,Useful and easy to carry
1,Great
1,"Best charging cord ever!!!!!! Not only do I thoroughly enjoy the length of this cord, it does charge my phone a lot faster than the factory cable that comes with the phone."
1,Great product
1,"This is the charger to have in your glove box of your car or boat. All you need to charge this charger is the sun, no matter where you are you can usually see the sun. "
1,I have always used Otter boxes.  I took a chance on this and I really like it.  It is durable and more streamlined than my other cases.
-1,Came broken very disappointed
-1,The sticky part loses its stickiness cases the holder to fall
1,"Fits great and does its job so far. I wish this had a screen protector, but its exactly what we needed."
-1,Broke within a few weeks
1,Great.  Love it.
1,Purchased this for my dad after he took his phone for a swim without a waterproof case. He says he loves it!
1,This was purchased for a friend. She loves it.
0,"Defintely test it out first before you put your iPhone in it.  It leaked the first time, but after I got the air out of it first, then it was fine.  It's a little cheaply made, so this is really only good for a 2-3 times use.  Overall, good for the price and for a one time use.  I threw mine away after our trip to Hawaii."
-1,"It takes the cover off of your phone when you take it off, pretty annoying actually.  I wonder if I'm going to damage my phone when i put it on or off.  Other than that it's fine."
1,I love it! It's a must have if you never want to damage your phone. I've had one for all my phones. Would never not have one. Falls out of my car from my lap and it's nothing. It's perfect!
0,Fits my S5 perfectly. Only problem is the thing is HUGE and is award to wear at the gym.
1,"I own both sizes but didn't buy on amazon, due to they were not carried at the time.  I just bought my 12 oz.  I can say from using these since December, I couldn't be happier.  I take it on the boat in Ga summer,  the stainless steel is hot to touch on outside of cup but I have ice and my tea isn't watered down.<br />My husband sits my coffee next to my bed around 5am.  When I get up at 7 or 8 I still have hot coffee.<br />Also he will fix my 16 oz with tea and sit next to my bed in morning's and I drink it most of the day.  At night a cup is fixed for me snd in the morning I still have a drink thats not watered down. My coke doesn't get watered down quick either.<br />Yes, these do keep your coffee Hot but don't expect.it to be streaming hot in 4 hour's.  But I will say. It will keep your ice (there will be some melting its not a freezer) to 24 hours depending on where your using it at.  No problem with leaking in any of them.<br />Do not have the stainless steel taste,  I have another bubba that is stainless steel.  Do not like that one and took it back.<br />This has to be a good product for me to write this long of a review.<br /><br />Too bad Amazon doesn't have a seller on here that sells them for reasonable prices 19.99 and down, which us what I've paid at other stores"
1,This is the second time I order this screen protector. I constantly drop my phone in its face and this protector probably started to get a little damaged around the 20th time I dropped it. But it did its job and protected my actual screen! There wasn't one scratch on it
0,"Great phone, however it does NOT have a place for a sim card. Not happy with the false advertisement."
-1,Would not recommend plastic edges where the phone sits chipped off and I've only had it for a month.
1,Loving my new selfie stick! It's very handy to use. It's connected to your phone and it's easy to use!
1,Works great
-1,Came with parts missing
1,"Fantastic!! It fits perfectly, was delivered on time, and looks great. Snagged my sweater a little but so far so great, otherwise."
-1,As soon as I tried to put it on my phones screen it immediately made huge bubbles that wouldn't come out. I ended up just throwing it in the trash.
1,Is a great case all around. Very slim and durable.
1,"I received this case as promised.  I love, love it.  It fits the phone like a glove, top quality through and through.  I love the color, the look and the feel. I have several cases for my phone but this one is in a class by itself."
0,this phone case is alright but it gets dirty really easily and is hard to clean. It doesn't come with a screen protector either...
1,No problems. Works well and the blue light is cool. Packaging was great.
1,great
1,Got this for a replacement for my sons phone. His wouldn't hold a charge anymore. When this one came in he put it in his phone right away and it has worked great and will hold a charge.It had a 75% charge on it when we got it in the mail. It fit his phone just like it came with his phone.
-1,"Junk, lasted about four hours. Won't turn back on, hopefully they'll send me a new one, or money back"
1,"Exactly what it says, I've bought 5 cars and this one is by far my favorite. I have two!"
-1,The picture clearly shows the protector fitting the entire screen. However it barely covers half. And it looked like poor quality too. I returned mine.
-1,It works only a little better than the original battery which barley lasts the day without even regular use once it has been charged..no problems with on time delivery
1,its good
0,My phone fits fine and it has been durable and the key pocket has worked great for me. The only Cons I can find is that the ring used to connect the extension strap pinched my arm and after a while of running I had to stop to align it and then keep running. I drilled two small holes on the plastic ring and then sewed the ring to the original strap to prevent it from rotating and no more arms pinch.
1,"these are useful for small projects, the connectors work fine and i don't have any issues with the construction of them. good value, you get exactly what you expect from this product."
1,"Very nice and sturdy feeling, the film that comes with it is removable and I replaced it with a glass screen protector."
-1,does not charge the battery  i think it is broken
1,Always nice to have extra USB chargers in the truck!  How can you go wrong?
1,"Love it!! Perfect size, awesome design, very practical, and perfect fit."
-1,"This unit is awful. It is extremely cheaply produced, the walls are thin plastic and fragile, as it arrived all cracked. The unit connects to my bluetooth, but continually pauses the music or begins to make random horrendous white noises over the music. All together, it is just a terrible unit. Don't waste your money!"
1,I love it. I have a 2ft one for my car and 6ft one for home. Works great and is stylish at the same time!
-1,Does not work with a brand new 2015 Chevy Camaro.. Disappointing...
-1,Stopped working after a few uses
1,"This seemed like a good idea at the time...but I have NEVER used it!  I don't know how anyone would actually use this thing.  Oh, it works the way it was designed and is strongly made!  It's just not practical at all!  I've giving it a 5 star because it does what it says it will do.  I just can't see how anyone would put this on the windshield and be able to drive safely without a HUGE blind spot!  Maybe put it in the back for the kids to watch movies or something?"
-1,Didn't last. The cheap ones sold at Target for $5.00  last way longer.
-1,"I loved these headphones great sound ni cracks with volume up all the way, but they just stopped working today no more than 10 min ago. Nothing happened I unplugged them then when I plugged them back in 10-15 min later nothing. So so so so very disappointed."
1,worked great and it was cheaper then wal-mart
1,"Had the watch for a couple of weeks now and it is a must have for me. Works well with my Samsung Galaxy S3. Did have to change my messenger service to Google's to read the full texts. Easy to respond to a text via voice. Controls my music and the display is nice. I just wish the battery life was better and there were more covers for this watch. Overall, I'm pleased with my watch."
1,"This is a truly great GREEN product!  Unlike plastic phone covers, the eCo-cover doesn't slip out of hands or pockets per its &#34;rubbery&#34; feel, but made from CORN!  Baby safe BPA free makes it ok for our grand-babies to chew on and handle.  So we protect our phones, grandkids, and the environment all at once.  So cool."
1,"Put my iPhone in this and took it out on the water in a Kayak. The pictures were perfect, and I could easily make phone calls and receive text messages."
1,"I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The product is of fine quality, is extremely durable, professional, light-weight, and is very short in comparison to the huge 2-port USB car chargers. This charger is unique in that it is extremely compatible and prevents over-heat by stopping immediately when the charge is complete. Since, I am using<br />my phone all the time - I usually tend to run out of battery by the afternoon. This charger is very cost-efficient and speedy. The charger itself is very easy to use - you just have to plug it into the socket attaching a USB charger from the USB port to your phone. I noticed that it charges quicker when the phone is off / wifi-3g is off, and so I feel its preferable to use it that way - for better and faster results . Very pleased. A+! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
0,really cheaply made
1,"Love this product, small and works very well. Love the low profile."
1,"This review is for: Car Charger, Benks 3 Ports USB 5.5 Amp (2.4a 2.1a 1a) Smart Universal High Capacity in black<br /><br />I received a sample for my honest review.<br /><br />This charger is very compact so it does not protrude too much from the port. With three ports, we can keep all our electronics charged up on the go without fights in our van. This charges our iphones and ipods quickly without any connection problems. It feels well made and sturdy.<br /><br />No problems so far."
-1,I ordered these batteries as replacements for my wife's phone. A month outside of the eligible return window one of the batteries swelled and stopped functioning. Hopefully I can find a more reliable vendor to order a replacement for the defective battery they sent me that won't nearly pop inside her phone.
1,"We use Square on an iPad in an Otterbox to check guests out. It's way easier than signing with a finger. We used to just buy the cheapest ones we could because the rubber tips would break in dry weather or after a particularly heavy handed customer. But the last set we bought we so unresponsive and the rubber broke so fast I started looking for another option. It's so frustrating trying to check someone out and switching through all the styluses before finally giving up and telling guests to just use their finger. These are so wonderful! I was hesitant about the metal mesh on them but our iPad cover is fine, absolutely no scratches (at least not from the stylus). All three write nice and smooth and are very responsive, even through the plastic cover. And I love that I can just replace the tips when they break instead of having to buy entirely new styluses. We tape feathers on them so it's nice not having to reattach the feathers when the pen wears out. One of the tips busted on the edge the first day which was a little disappointing. But now after a month of heavy use all the other tips are holding up just fine so I think that one was just a fluke."
1,Arrived in 2 days I was so excited and this case is perfect! The camo on the back is so smooth and doesn't peal off worth the 8 bucks!! Would definatly recommend and would buy again!!
1,This things is AWESOME. Fits great and it appears to be able to protect it no problem. I can even use my Samsung Wireless charger through it which I could not do with another style. Not having to take the case off every night to charge is a bg bonus. The kickstand appears to be metal in the photo. It is plastic. Still works but I fear the mechanism that holds (Plastic Bump) it into the case will wear out and the kickstand will become useless and have to be ripped off. We will see though.
-1,"Didn't fit phone at all, very cheap and poorly constructed. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Purchased this for my daughter.  She is very happy with product
1,perfect product and shipped fast.  Thanks!
1,"Well made, durable, excellent buy, and excellent seller to do business with."
1,very great quality
1,"Incredibly cute Totoro case, his face here cracks me up! This held together fairly well in the 6 month time-frame I used it for, the picture didn't get scratched off or anything. Decent price as well."
1,"Audio clarity is excellent.  I haven't had a dropped call since I started using this headset.  I'm am told by people on the other end the call has excellent audio as well.  The headset is a little large and takes a little time to get used to or it did for me.  I wear glasses and that may be why it took some time but I am very happy with the features that my old bluetooth headsets didn't have and the call clarity and reliability they did not have either.  I really like the single use buttons as the mute was frequently unusable on my other headsets but a piece of cake with this one.  As to talk time it seems to be very close to what they claim, I seem to be getting somewhere between 6 to 7 hours between charges.  For someone who uses a headset professionally this headset is well worth the extra coin."
1,"Love it love it love it!!!! One of the best cover. A bit shallow on the sides, but the jelly material hugs the phone enough to protect it. I highly recommend this one."
1,Haven't had a chance to use it yet. But it arrived ok and is fully charged and ready to go.
1,Mom actually uses it.
1,"Got this to cover a tablet we bought for my nephew and it works great. He is autistic and doesn't usually like these things on but he has no problem with it, he actually likes it."
1,"I purchased this Avantek CD Slot Car Mount Holder for my husband who drives a lot<br />for work & uses his phone for gps.<br />This is nice because he can do it hands free.<br />The magnet is bigger & much stronger then others he's had in the past.<br />Being able to tighten the flap to get a good secure hold in the cd slot is nice, especially with larger phones that have thick protective cases that make the phone heavier.<br />With the heavy duty magnet & secure slot mount you don't have to worry about the phone falling off while driving.<br />The only disadvantage with this is it does block the view of the clock & some of the buttons one the radio but that is still better then the others that connect to your air vent & block the flow, they don't hold as well as this one & living in Arizona in the summer you need all your vents.<br />So overall this is nice sturdy product.<br /><br />I received it at a discount in exchange for my fair and unbiased opinion."
1,Fit note 4 perfectly no issues with this
-1,Battery life was okay ... but the build quality was horrendous!... on both batteries the flat cover for the bottom of the batteries came off the first time I put them on the included battery charger!. Needless to say I sent them back and got me a refund.
1,"Fits perfectly, lots of extra room for my other cables and earbuds. Great quality and very sturdy material. Protects the headphones wonderfully!"
1,"I dropped my iPhone in a river this weekend, after searching for about 5-10 minutes for it I found it buried in the mud about 3ft below water. I was still panicking until I hit the home key and it turned on like nothing had happened. I've dropped this thing a couple times too without any damage to the phone. There are hairline fractures in the plastic but apparently they haven't compromised the watertightness of the case. Sooooo happy I put this case on my phone!"
-1,Piece of crap. So tight. Doesn't even Barely fit.
0,Pros:<br />1) Great sounding earbuds<br />2) Great price<br />3) Music/Call control<br />4) Decent BT range<br />5) Good sweat/waterproofing<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Ear pieces fall out of ears constantly (tried all fittings)<br />2) Hard to adjust properly for comfort. I wear with wire under my chin as behind my head makes ear pieces fall out even more.<br />3) Takes a long time to charge<br />4) Battery life isnt long enough (4-6hrs tops)
1,I just love this case nice and sturdy compared to otter box it's great thanks
-1,I received a bad part after putting on it starting separating from the base and had to pay to get a brand new screen after already buying this one
1,This is a great product. Would highly recommend . I have 4 of them. They are the best chargers .
1,I love this screen cover. It  installs easy an protects my screen as advertised. I would recommend it  as one of the best.
1,Headphones work well. I use them for three hours every other day and the battery has lasted well.  They charge quickly.  Its been much easier to turn them on and off once I got the hang of turning them on and off with the left earphone in my ear so I could hear the alerts.
1,Very good
-1,Not all that exciting
-1,Very bad quality. It broke very easily because the extension was glued on. I would not recommend this product.
-1,"Biggest POS I have ever bought in my life!  Waited too long to install so couldn't return it.  Remote doesn't work, eject button broke on first day and DVD player skips on every bump.  Sent it back to Pyle (AKA pile!) After paying 50 dollars in shipping got in back and had all the same issues within a week.  Time for a sledge hammer and a $250 loss!"
1,Just what I wanted !!!
1,Great protection! Make sure you get a case that protects the screen edges. I wish I knew that prior to purchase.
0,Good phone case but I cannot turn the button on the side from silence to ring with the case on. I have to remove the case to do so.
1,Excellent bluetooth transciever. Beautifull sound with my headphones.
1,"Received this phone the other day and it's exactly what I needed.  It is a refurbished phone but it's in excellent condition.  No scratches or visible sign of use.  Came in original box with all necessary accessories.  All I had to do was slip my already owned and active AT&T sim card (from a broken phone I was replacing with this one) into the slot and voila!  Back to business as usual.  Didn't need to contact AT&T, unlock or register anything online, etc.  It just works period.  And is set for service in the United States,  east coast to be specific.  Thanks for excellent service and a perfect product. Please be advised that you may want to double check but I'm almost positive that this phone will only work with an AT&T plan and not T-MOBILE.   I was told that the Skyrocket version of the Galaxy S2 was exclusive to AT&T.  I am confident that it will 100% work great on AT&T networks but if you have any other cell carriers call them first and ask if the Skyrocket can be activated on their network.   I'm pretty sure the answer is no. Hope this helps anyone interested. =)"
-1,It looks pretty cheap in person. Doesn't look like it would protect my phone either. You get what you pay for.
1,"Great product, got delivered quickly and with no issues! Highly recommend!"
1,nice case will order again in future
1,Perfect for a computer desktop or gaming set up. Loud enough to fill a single room but not much larger than that
1,"These things are wonderful.  We have at least 6 now, one in each car along with a few around the house.  The flashlight is very bright and works great!  When I need a flashlight I look for one of these before any of the other flashlights I have.  These are particularly useful when camping.  Use the flashlight in the evening then plug it into your phone to charge it back up over night.  In the morning we recharge them from the car and they are ready to go again for the next night."
0,"Not the best, not the worst! Amazon tends to recommend this with 440 MHz profeng radios, you WILL need an adaptor! They are PL259 this is a wee little one!"
1,It's great if you tend to drop your phone alot like me. It's very durable and it does glow in the dark somewhat.
-1,Not a good material I could made a better one but for the price I guess it's ok
-1,This is a very cheap product that felt weak the moment I picked it up out of the package. The sides felt like they would break away from the main screen and screen felt less like glass and more like plastic. I ended up removing it and taking my phone into a repair shop to get a new screen put in that has been much better. I would recommend a different product or just paying someone else to replace your screen for you.
-1,"I just received this product, however the screw that came with didnt fit inside. It is really disappointing."
-1,Great GPS but the program you need to register and update maps will not open and run on most computers....save your money...do not buy!
-1,Total piece of crap- use your iPhone. I got lost out of Boston Logan. This thing can't be trusted. My trusty iPhone worked. What the hell was I thinking?
1,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT
1,My sister-in-law found some of these at a flea market.  Since I am always losing my regular stylus my husband suggested that I also look for some that attach to the phone.  I was happy to find these on Amazon.  They arrived very quickly and work just fine like my larger stylus.  I love all the different bright colors and I really like that I can attach them to my phone.  I'll probably never be like the younger people who can just text with their thumbs.
1,"Great product, protective and useful."
1,gooooood
1,Good product
1,"I have never had a non glare screen protector and while it does add better viewing in highly lighted areas and in the sun it does not have the Anti-Fingerprint and bubble free application.  FROM THE DESCRIPTION......Features: Matte, Anti-glare, Anti-fingerprint, anti-scratch, anti-ultraviolet, bubble-free application, ultra-clear transparency, ultra-strength, and improves handwriting recognition.<br />I still have to clean it as much as the ones that are not non glare and myself and someone else tried to put it on several times and althought we got bubble retuction down each time we applied there are still about 4 little and one a little larger bubble.<br />All and all still happy with the product though, better than the last screen protector I had and a great value for the price."
-1,"Advertised to fit wrists 135-195 mm.  My wrist is 153 mm, and this band was still way too big, even with all four links removed.  Returning the band was trouble free, after I called Amazon and complained about me having to pay the return postage (Amazon credited my account with the return postage).  The band, itself, was very attractive with the Space Gray Sport Watch.  I would have kept it had it fit."
1,nice
1,Good product and easy to set up.
-1,Product didn't work waste of money
1,"There is a ridge on the bottom that partly blocks the rear charger port on my Garmin GPS.  However, I just managed to shove the Garmin into position with the cord attached.  The holder grips it firmly and doesn't slide around on the dashboard.  The last universal holder I bought had little plastic gripper fingers that broke.  So far, this holder seems to be a more reliable performer."
1,"Slightly heavier than i thought it would be but that's ok. Haven't really used it much yet but i'll be taking it to work with me this week to try it out. Takes a while to fill to 100% which is understandable.<br /><br />I've finally used it and i've found that it loses power just as fast as the item charging!  My Note 4 has a 3220mAh battery and it seems that for every percent i gain on my phone, I lose it on the charger! Let's hope this is just a fluke."
0,The cord stopped retracting after the first time I used it... otherwise it charges the phones as expected...
-1,"the most inconvenient nuvi of the 3 that we have had.  wish I had my old one back LM40 (was easy, sweet & simple). On the way to look at the 55lm manual again but really shouldn't have to after a year of use."
1,"Great phone ,cheap and better<br /> than Nokia Lumia 822.That one crushes sometimes for no reason.!"
1,As good if not Better than the one that came in the box day one. How Anyone could rate this poorly is beyond me.
1,"Great protective case, cheaper than life proof, have used case for under water photos and just in the shower.  Slight loss of touch screen sensitivity but not enough to complain about"
-1,The case didn't fit the phone properly and the buttons didn't line up. Waste of money.
1,"Case fit perfectly, the design does not wear off like many other cases I have bought in the past. My favorite case by far and would recommend to anyone who likes Fairy Tail."
0,"Fast phone, thin and lightweight. The edge screen isn't practical, the functionality it does have is useless, and often holding the phone results in the screen sensing more than one finger on it because of the dual edges. Don't waste your money, just get a S6 or note 5"
-1,"Not worth it honestly, says it is scratch  resistant but it's all full of scratches, they're hard to see but shine light onto it and you'll see them everywhere. Dirt and whatnot goes through it so if you buy it don't expect it to seal and keep your phone clean also edges stain. Now it is a faded yellow and has blue due to my jeans. As far as protecting it it seems decent, I purchased a glass screen protector so that has mainly been keeping it together, recently dropped it hard and screen protector slightly cracked, if I didn't have it on I feel like it would've damaged the screen. Other times I've dropped my phone height was relatively low/soft drop."
1,"Fit and worked well, get price."
1,Fits perfectly
-1,I've had this screen protector on for less than a week and it has already began cracking on the bottom left edge. It is line up perfectly and not hanging over the rounded corner and I have not dropped it.Other than that it would be nice......unfortunately I am sure it will continue to crack and split since it has started already.
1,Very easy to apply.  Clear instructions.  All tools needed are included.  Adheres by itself with no bubbles
-1,"So I have had my device for all of 6 hours......can't say that I am overly thrilled. Received this the heart band and the color slides for an overdue birthday gift. My first observation is the small is clearly not small enough. I can slide one whole finger into the band and that is it on the smallest hole I get to, leaving two holes open because the device itself is so wide I can't get it any tighter (see picture). I can't figure out if there is a specific place I am supposed to tap on it because I will tap it in five different places before it wakes up. What I do like is that it does not look like the obvious Fitbit most ppl have. But know I am wondering with the bad reviews from the app, should I have just gone with the majority????? The color is very subtle, but appropriate. I will give it more time. I do like the text messages, the move texts, etc. that is pretty neat."
-1,"This was terrible, I do not recommend buying this product. False advertising."
1,Great!
0,This cord seems to work okay for me the only problem I had was that I believed to order the 5 foot cord and I got the 3 foot cord instead I had I had the 5 but could check off on the order but somehow that wasn't what I got however it is a good card but just make sure if you are ordering the 5 foot cord that's what you get
1,works great!
1,Nice and durable! Love the design and color. The stand is a neat gadget to have as well :)
1,Works great and the price was right. The 2 different charge rates (one 1amp one 2.1amp) are a nice feature.
1,"I wouldn't recommend dropping your phone in a public toilet, but I did.  I grabbed it quickly, after it totally submerged, and it actually kept working."
1,... Anything else is a total waste of money.  Sound quality is high and the cord is very durable.
1,"Best made and my second purchase for my Daughter.Excellent reception, noise reduction and fit. You can't go wrong with this one."
1,These arrived right on time. I feel that it was a good value for the price. Not sure how long they will last but with 5 more of them I'm not too worried.
1,I am confused about calculating a route. It tells me there are sections that the motorhome cannot travel yet it apparently does not route around those sections. I do like all of the motorhome features that are built in. I have not used it to go on a trip yet.
1,great
1,Love it!
1,Does what is expected
1,Exactly what I needed. Fit perfect and the install was a breeze.
1,"loving them , I got the black one also ."
1,"charges both my tablet and my cellphone. powerful yet lightweight. now if I forget to charge I have the perfect charger. have bought quite a few different chargers,and this is the perfect one. Thanks Amazon for the right price and the speedy delivery."
1,great item
1,Great product. I wish I had ordered one years ago. Works on my old Droid Bionic. Gives me all day use. Bought 2 so my wife would not have to charge her battery except at night. Extended back covers fits perfectly and the screen protectors and wipes were a bonus. Actually my phone is easier to hold now that it is thicker. Buy one. You will like it.
1,MET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS AND GREAT PRICE FOR A BASIC TOUCH SCREEN RADIO
1,Was very nice for the price.  Fast delivery.
1,Works Great!
1,Very satisfied with product and service.
1,Easy to install
1,"I now have an iPhone 5 with a new lease of life with a good battery.  As well as carefully reviewing the good instructions and video, I would recommend that you search youtube.com for &#34;iphone pry damage&#34;.  The riskiest part of replacing an iPhone battery is damaging the circuit board around the battery when prying off the battery.  While the instructions provided here show the &#34;safe&#34; places to pry, other sources suggest only the case edge should be used.  I also recommend doing this in a warm environment, we did this in a hot room on a very hot day and the higher temperature very likely softened the adhesive and made the prying relatively easy.  It takes a while from the case side and there are some rather unnerving ripping like sounds as the adhesive gives way but it all worked in the end.<br /><br />A good product at a great price.  I take off one start because the pentalobe tool was too big for the screws on my iPhone 5 - a Nov 2012 Verizon edition.  I don't know if the pentastar screws got bigger in later editions but coaxing these screws out at the start of the procedure was the most difficult part of the whole exercise.  The screen removal and even the battery prying were quicker in comparison!"
-1,"Hated the way it fit my Samsung Galaxy S3. It seemed to have a lot of wiggle room still.  My main complaint is that the case I received covered the flashlight and it was very hard to use the side buttons.  Plus the stand seemed very cheap,  broke within days so the stand kept popping out. I felt like my phone wasn't very safe in this as well. Wasn't good for my phone at all."
0,I'm wasn't such a fan of the texture of the case. It's really rough. I ended up covering the case in epoxy to make a smooth finish. Now I love the case! Super sparkly and cute!
-1,"My button is hard to press. Can't get the led to turn on.<br />Sent an email, hopefully they'll respond.<br />I may have received a defective product."
1,GREAT ITEM
1,"This is a great alternative to an Otter box case, my husband is very hard on phones and hates Otter boxes due to the bulkiness of the cases, he has dropped his phone many many times, but this case has held up perfectly! Also the kick stand makes for easy video watching while feeding a baby. Lol"
0,"It's a good case, but it's not made for Xperia Z1 because the ports are not accessible, so you can't charge or use headset with the case on.  I give it 3 stars beause it protects the phone well.  Perhaps it fits other models better?"
1,"Easy to use, simple set up."
1,Wear it almost every day.  Good fit - easy to put on.  Stays in place.  Love it!
-1,Didn't work. Had to return.
1,"Magpul cases are always great value for the money, this was no exception. The one thing I take away a star for is the slight slipperiness of this material, though I'm comparing it to that of Speck's Candyshell Grip cases which are my overwhelming favorite. Wish Magpul would design in some extra grip (stylish as a gun case, of course) so that I'd be more confident my $1,000 phone will have a fighting chance of staying in my hand or where I place it."
1,"Very useful - clip your cell-phone in this and you won't have any difficulty finding it!  Easy to manipulate.  Grips my i5 securely, even in it's case.  Easy to carry, seems robust."
1,"This item is fine, but why, OH WHY does it have an LED on it?<br /><br />Let me explain...<br /><br />I'm guessing most people charge their phones, etc., at night. I'm guessing a lot of them, like me, have their charger by their bed.<br /><br />And I'm also guessing most people want to sleep in a more-or-less dark room.<br /><br />Well, TOO BAD, because rather than looking at your device to see if the charger is working (which you will do anyway, to make sure the cord works and is plugged in all the way), this charger, by your bed, has a nice, bright LED on it to tell you it is working.<br /><br />Even sticking it in a nightstand drawer gave the outline of the drawer a real special-effect, &#34;E.T.&#34; sort of glow.<br /><br />Okay, fine, it's a small problem—a piece of electrical tape over the light solved it—but I'm continuously baffled by things like this. I have hearing loss, and the electric hearing drier I put my hearing aids in at night has FOUR LEDs on it. Can't even keep it in the same room with me if I want to sleep. I could read by it.<br /><br />I'm sure Anker put a light on this to try to be helpful, but honestly it seems like it's not really paying attention to the most common use case? Or perhaps &#34;charging at night on your bedside table&#34; is an edge case?<br /><br />Otherwise, it absolutely works. Rant aside, I'd buy it again."
1,Nice durable  case.  The volume and power on/off button very hard to use.
1,"I bought this case trying to enhace the cosmetic aspect of my Iphone 6 Plus, i was using a magpul case before this one and let me tell you it looks gorgeous.<br /><br />Top notch quality but be careful when taking off since it looks fragile too.<br /><br />Very good buy IMO."
-1,Worked great for charging but did not work for the data in my car radio
1,Duh bomb diggity.
1,"Great product, perfect protection for an expensive phone."
1,Well made product which is working well so far!
1,Easy to appy (bubbles really do disappear like magic!) .  Prompt shipment was also appreciated.  I will definitely order from this seller again.
-1,"The case is really cute but once you put two cards and your phone in, it is difficult to close. Also the phone isn't tight inside the case."
1,Great case.
-1,it is not harnes cable
-1,Garbage product. Did not protect phone at all.
1,More than i expect excelet very happy with it Its powerfull fast big screen and touch And the price is the big deal
-1,"The watch works as is promised, but the casing and strap is PoS.  I only had the watch for a month before the strap broke.  Samsung refuse to refund me and 2 days later the casing that hold the straps broke too. It's a shame because the watch it's self is good but now I wasted $ on a pocket watch."
1,These cases are fantastic. They hold up well and fit my iPhone 6 Plus perfectly!
0,Took about an hour to get the plastic part on after waiting almost a week and a half for it to come. Its a pretty color but I doubt its ever coming off.
1,ok
1,super technology at its best.
1,"This is just what I was looking for - a durable, inexpensive, made-to-fit screen shield. Installation was straightforward thanks to the clear directions. The shield has been on my phone for 7 months now and still looks new. Fingerprints clean off easily and completely. Still no scratches. Does not dim or distort the display. I'm completely satisfied with this product."
-1,You will need to purchase double sided tape in order for this product to work. Adhesive page is worthless. Directions are also not clear as to where to separate the broken glass. Do not assume that it's the seam in the phone's edge. You pry the glass off from the very top edge of phone.
1,"So far, I love it! Perfect for office settings. Very discreet. Smallest bluetooth that I have ever had. Battery life only runs about 3 hours of music play, but for this prices, it may be worth buying two to get through the day :)"
1,"If u talk a lot on the phone wile driving this is excellent. Great batt. Life, comfortable, and plaenty loud to hear wile driving in ur semi truck. I only have to charge this head set once a week and I talk on it for hours every day."
1,Good purchase! A bit unfitting but works good enough!
1,"I like the look a lot.  I had an Otterbox but could never find my phone because the case was black.  The case fits well.  I did crack the glass protector screen and am not sure it would have cracked with the other case. There is  no way to really tell but I think this offers a little less protection, is less bulky, but is much nicer looking."
1,Great deal! Brilliant application. A monkey could do it perfectly.
-1,My case won't even snap on to my phone...
1,"I replaced a failing Apple lightning cabe with this one and it works great.  The connector is the same size as the Apple connector, so it can be plugged in without having to remove the case I use."
1,Able to use the same number right away when switching from an old cell to an iPhone by modifying the existing SIM. Skipped the whole porting hassle.
1,Great product at discount price. Seller delivered as listed.
1,Fast charge.
1,Works fantastic!!
0,"Yes this case served it's purpose, however it was inconvenient for taking pictures (which really is to be expected with this type of case). The lowered review is due to the fact that the edges of this product quickly started fraying and the case discolored fairly fast, there is no good way to clean this product)."
1,Love this product! Came right away...and was easy to put on...Perfect fit for my phone!
1,"Is a very nice item, is practice, save the phone any time. The price is normal for it. I like so much. Thank you amazon for delivery faster in my address."
0,"I ordered it for use with my S6 but it won't work with my Otterbox installed, so no my wife has one in two different locations."
1,"This thing is awesome. Easy to apply and extremely solid, yet somehow not too thick..."
1,Works as advertised.  No issues on my 10.5 S.
1,"When put on correctly, it works perfectly. It fell into place and it didn't kill the clarity of the screen."
1,"Nice and slim, haven't dropped it yet but the inside liner seems like it should protect it from 2-3' drops just fine.<br />I like the design and would recommend this case to anyone except and Eagles or Seahawks fan."
1,"After 2 years, my Fre model case was falling apart.  The rubber was tearing around the sides, the switch tab for the mute switch broke, and the plastic on both the front and back was warping from the heat of the phone.  I wanted a waterproof case, so I figured I would try the Nuud model.  The case seems much better than the Fre case with a more rigid back.  The use of a stick-on screen protector instead of the Fre cover is a world of improvement over screen viewing ability as well as touch control.  The raised edge around the screen takes just a bit to get used to, but it it certainly beefy enough to maintain a good seal against the surface of the phone.  I have no intention of getting the phone wet, so this case is just-in-case protection and appears that it will handle the task well."
1,easy install.<br />good fit.<br />still attached even after 4 months of use.
1,Connected my entire downstairs to this which in turn is connected to a Sonos Connect.Amp.  Perfect sound through out the entire house.  Enabled me to hook everything up for a moderate cost.  I also love the ability to deselect speakers from the front.  I also didn't notice a difference in sound.  Great product.<br /><br />Super easy to setup.
1,"Works like a charm, remember folks, update update update."
1,"I bought this about two years ago. Today (August 29th 2015), this screen protector is still on my iPad and works just fine and lasts on the screen pretty much forever. Easy installation with no bubbles (just simply follow the rules). The sides have lifted up, but it still protects my iPad screen and definitely reduces the glares from excess sunlight."
1,Perfect.  Just what I expected.
1,My mother loved it and it came in a. Timely manner
1,excelent
-1,"Unfortunately these are not working for me. They did charge just fine but will not connect to the bluetooth on my iPhone 6. Granted I did purchase them on sale but I did so because I do not need anything fancy, just something to allow me to listen to music etc while I am out for my morning walk. These are going back."
1,"This product is a must, it definitely protects your phone and great customer service!"
-1,"Says its compatible with an iPad 4, but it will charge for a few minutes, then I will get a message that this accessory is not compatible with my iPad. All 4 cables do this. Wasted $12 on this junk."
-1,"I would give this a zero if I could. None of the cords worked, absolutely awful product."
1,"I've been a big fan of a competing case brand for several years and had not heard of Verus until recently.  I'm glad I discovered them, though.  This case is superb!  I really dig the hairline texture on the back; it adds style to the case and gives me a good grip on the phone.  The only complaint I have is that the corners are the hard plastic and not the TPU rubber.  I'm just afraid that the plastic will crack if I drop my device and it lands on a corner.  It may hold up just fine, though.  Hopefully I never have to find out."
1,"Great USB power.  Charges all my tablets at once, quickly too."
0,Jawbone Charging cable breaks quick. Not just this brand but others as well.
1,The color is really nice and I love how it protects my phone
1,Amazing product with affordable price
1,Came fast. Love it.  Good quality
1,Cheap and  convenient
1,"arrived quickly, great device"
1,Great case i got this as a gift for a friend it perfect for credit card also if you want extra 20.00 for free check out the link http://www.mynetspendcard.com/?uref=8005772755
0,"GXT1000 are way better for about 1/3 the price!!  These claim to be &#34;Military Spec&#34;.  But out of the 15 my company bought about 6 of them have broken on their first drop. ( I have had the GXT1000 for a few months now and apart from a few scuffs they are still holding up way better than the 5000s)<br /><br />Pros:  The sound is very crisp!<br />The lithium battery is awesome!<br />Water resistant.<br />Midland is a wonder company to deal with! They really back their products.<br /><br />Cons:  the antenna is not attached very well.  Those 6 that broke on the first drop have broken either the antenna and or the power/volume nob.  The mic must also not be that great because when someone is speaking using one of these it sounds very low on all radios (both GXT1000s and GXT5000s and other midland models that others have on our crew).<br /><br />In conclusion; if you are not going to be working in the rain or near water, or if you don't mind charging your walkie every 12 hours (of heavy use).  DO NOT GET THIS MODEL.  You'll get a way better bang for your buck with the GXT1000 model (don't even think about the 2000s either! Midland doesn't even sell those themselves anymore..)"
-1,"Product arrived on time, but failed to mention it only works for specific phone systems. Also the microphone had no capable function of working as it was defective"
1,"I bought three sound pods in the kickstarted campaing. I love them very much! The sound they produce is amazing. I use an IPhone 6+, but have also used other phones in it. They come very handy when one desperetly wants to hear music! I take them to camping because they don't use energy; I'm using two, I keep one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen and use them everyday. Totally worth it."
1,I installed this into my Jeep Grande Cherokee and it works perfectly. 99% of the engine noise was eliminated from my speakers. Very simple to install.
1,"Definitely recommend it, the battery last long, clear conversation."
-1,"Sounds great, easy to use but the remote hardly works! I also have the MW1 and it only work about 40% of the time. Extremely frustrating!!!"
1,Better than lifeproof which muffled my voice.  Liked waterproof of LP. But this works great
-1,"Unfortunately these ear-buds don't fit my ears, though they come with many different sizes you can try from.  I also noticed that the audio would cut in and out when only four or five feat away from the device."
-1,"Do not buy this product if you are looking for an actual otterbox.  Although this product says  &#34;Otterbox&#34; it is a knock off and I could tell from the moment I opened it.  The plastic is thin and feels like it would easily be broken, the rubber is too hard and not stretchy at all.  The back even says made in china.  Real Otterboxes are made in the USA.  I will not buy any product sold by this seller.  To add flame to the fire it took over 3 weeks to arrive, and it was complete junk, I hope this seller is shut down for fraud, and faces charges for ripping off the Otterbox design and name.  Shame shame."
1,Everything worked out great! good shipping.it arrived the day they said(it came early in the day)<br />It works witht-mobile.you just have to buy a sim card. But it comes with a charger and to my suprise some headphones that sound great.
1,Works wonderfully!!!
1,Prefect
1,A great deal.  Some people tell me they hear a slight echo.
1,"This case is perfect when you need to streamline your purse, and yet need essentials, such as bank card(s), cash, etc."
1,Good product slightly cheap looking but sturdy and well designed.
0,This works well but it's a bit shaky. It may be more stable with a smaller phone but my IPhone 6 Plus just wobbles a little too much. I like it because it's extends longer than most other window mounted devices making it easier to reach in my Hummer.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone looking for a phone mount that extends longer that your typical mount.
1,Can't live without these now
0,The headphones work as wireless headphones. Sometimes they will disconnect randomly and i'll have to turn them off and turn them back on for them to reconnect and it's kind of frustrating. I removed the over the ear plastic because it just was more uncomfortable than helpful and lately it has about a 5-10 second delay from when I press a button to the action occurring. It's not the best pair of wireless headphones I've ever had but they do what they're supposed to. You get what you pay for when it's $20 so I'm not really complaining but I definitely wouldn't buy another pair unless I had no choice.
1,great little cell phone holster.
1,"Works as advertised, both horizontally and vertically, and a good value.  Crafted to clear all S5 openings well.  I am satisfied."
-1,I love the case but the first time I put it on my phone piece cracked on the side.
-1,"I installed the lens before realizing how small it was. It's an almost fit. But the cutout doesn't even fit around the button. I checked the label, and it says &#34;note 4&#34;, but then I noticed a different sticker on the front of the box that says &#34;S6&#34;. I think I have the wrong one, and from some of the other recent reviews, I suspect I'm not alone..."
1,Nice head unit with a lot of features.  The RMX11M wired remote is a nice addition.
1,No more searching for a plug outlet while on vacation!
1,excellent product!
1,Love this case. It fits and is of good quality.
-1,"I used it only several times, the thing broke into two pieces at the joint of the bottom. Not good."
1,"I received this product in exchange for a unbiased review,the shipping was fast and packaged securely the instructions were easy to follow and this screen protector fit my device perfectly. all ports and speakers work properly, fingerprints are easy to wipe off. i put on a case right afterwards and the screen protector didn't interfere made of durable materials and keeps my screen safe from damage. I have dropped my phone several times since and I also keep it in a large purse nice price for the durability and quantity"
0,Nice cover for the back but doesn't do anything to protect the front.
1,"[[VIDEOID:56cad5d204e99f886c1ff956caa5204a]]HiFi for just a small size, when i received this Bluetooth speaker. i am already expecting that ill will just be like a phone when i play music because its too small fits my palm honestly although i am much impressed on packaging seller definitely got style. as soon i connected Bluetooth on my LG phone and start playing music darn what a HiFi, the bass and treble of music is great, I am surprised.I tried it on Micro SD card and it works too. with the small size i can bring this on parks to play music, pocket size so i can keep it on my pocket too. battery life is around 8 hrs of continuous playing, i did test that because i hook it up on my phone playing lullaby music for my toddler next room. good Bluetooth range, i don't need to get up to bed and change the lullabies song.<br />Easy to connect on Bluetooth, once your phone Bluetooth is ON just turn on the Bluetooth speaker, i am sure you will hear a Bluetooth ON\\"" then pair your device. Once paired you can start playing music.  Highly Recommended<br /><br />I received Bluetooth Wireless Portable Speaker by Argon technologies for FREE in exchange of my unbiased and honest own opinion review."
1,"Perfect for running, does not fall off your arm and both my iPhone 6 plus and Note 3 will fit in it."
1,All I can say is great product
1,Good quality screen film! The glitters are really pretty.
1,Perfect fit! print on case was slightly less brilliant than expected but still a fantastic case!
1,Just perfect
0,Could fit the phone better
1,Very nice as described
1,I recommend excellent product . All very good
1,About the nicest charging cable I have bought in my many years of android usage. Connectors feel solid and the cable is nice and flexible.
-1,"I wanted to love this cable, but it stopped working within a month. The cable it replaced (different brand) is frayed but still works. This K-ble charger is completely in tact but won't charge my phone anymore. Disappointing and a waste of money. Maybe I just got a bad one. Hopefully others will have better luck."
1,Good looking case
1,Love it!  Looks awesome in person!  The extra bulky/size that's added to the phone is itself is justifiable for the added protection.
1,Absolutely a perfect phone for the price. Love it!
0,"nothing much, just a mount"
1,Awesome for the beach!
1,"Awesome case. I love it. It really gives a more refined look to your phone, and meets all expectations."
1,"The USB Charger RAVPower 24W 4.8A was a great buy for the money. With it pushing 24 watts of power and the dual 2.4 amp ports, it was just what I needed to charge up my ipad and iphone in a short amount of time. If you're looking for a fast charger at a great price, look no further."
1,works good interesting fits great can't tell its there easy to put on
1,I love the case it feels good in your hand it don't slip out and it  protects the phone nicely I have dropped my phone twice and it seems to hold up to no dings
1,This case has proven itself to be completely waterproof. We went kayaking down river and my husband was using this case with his iPhone 5s when he got flipped out of kayak. He lost his phone in the case because it did not float. In a little less than 24 hours we received a phone call stating the phone was found and it was working because find my iPhone gave them my number to call. The phone sat in case under water for almost 24 hours before it was found and still worked perfectly when we got it back. The only con is that we should have bought a floating wrist band to attach to it so it would not have sunk. Very thankful for this case for keeping our phone dry.
1,"Solid arm band, a bit big for my I phone 5, but definitely get the job done"
-1,"As a protective device, this is an excellent case. However, the case is so &#34;airtight&#34; that I miss 25% of my calls because it will not slide out of the holster/clip. The rubberized cover surrounding the actual phone has a high friction co-efficent with the hard case that holds the phone to the belt that pulling it out when being called requires both hands. The result is missed calls or buttons being pushed by mistake.<br /><br />There are some places where a Fort Knox case is impractical... this is one. In the end, the rubberized section of the case is beginning to stretch and soon I will need to replace it."
1,It is charging my Samsung NOTE 2 and S4 without a problem... works just fine. From 20% to 100% in about 2hrs.<br />I am happy.
1,Works great with all my devices. Small size a plus.
1,Perfect for my trip down the Chattahoochie
1,Works  great.
1,"Fits nicely, good video to follow"
1,works good with my phone
-1,Terrible quality. Cheaply made. Cheap packaging as well. Case came cracked/bent. Not recommended
1,This product is pretty nice. Feels great in the hands.
1,"Quick turnaround, just as described."
1,I bought one pair to test them out.  Turned around and order 3 more for Christmas gifts!  Best $10 and free Prime shipping I'll spend this holiday season!
1,excelent cuality
1,Great product
-1,the touch is not at all good and the phone is very slow
0,"I have ordered several of these and have recommended it to 5 or so friends.  No more.  The cradle that holds the phone gets weak and the phone &#34;droops.&#34;  On the two purchased most reticently, the ball that fits into the back of the cradle to allow positioning has literally broken off.  As for the charging unit, the fuse inside seems to burn out rather quickly.  I would suggest looking at other products before purchasing this one."
1,The best phone case I've ever had!!!
1,Works as intended.  The slot through the middle is a nice touch for keeping a power cord attached.  We use it for a 10&#34; tablet in the family room.
0,I though it was the crystal one
1,"It is very easy to install, and so far so good.  Holds the phone perfectly (Note2). No issues at all, and got exactly what I expected. Very solid piece of equipment."
-1,These head phones sucked wouldn't pair and if they did the sound was crap
0,can take some time to find the right fit on my head.
1,"Fantasic charger.<br /><br />Charged iphone 6 and galaxy s6 simultaneously from 0 - 100 in about one hour.<br /><br />Also, it's really small and sleek. Love it."
1,very pleased
1,Now all I need is an Iphone cover with purses!!!
1,This is a VERY nice product that came in useful as soon as it  was charged. PERFECT for my needs at work and on the road. Beautiful design and feels &#34;good&#34; to hold as well. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a power boost for their devices that allows the device to charge and be used at the same time (at least with a phone anyway!).
1,"Very nice product, especially for the price.  The build quality is good, and the included resizing tool works well."
1,Authentic replacement battery for the Note 3
1,"Wonderful cover. Absolutely the thinnest cover that I've ever seen, and I have been receiving great comments from other people about it as well. I really wanted a minimalistic cover for my iPhone, and no doubt this fills the bill."
1,I love it!!
1,Good
1,Love this:)
1,"This is my new favorite car charger. I love that it has a retractable cord. It also has a second usb slot so that you can charge a second item. I plugged my phone in to the retractable cable on my short trip home from work (about 15 minutes) and it charged my phone 5% in that short period of time. My previous charger would only maintain my phones charge on the same trip. The retractable cord is the perfect length for the card and it retracts smoothly, so it seems like it will last for a long time. This is a great charger for the price. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
1,Works OK but bad closing flap. Doesn't close all the way
-1,Clip broke within 2-3 weeks of having it
-1,"I bought an original one from apple store for 22$.<br />I needed another one as back up to keep in the office, so instead of buying it from apple store, I ordered this on Amazon for less than 5$.<br /><br />NOT A GOOD IDEA. It does't stay in place firmly. Move laptop a little bit and the screen is gone. Avoid it if you are planned to use a display port for an important presentation. You don't wanna get embarrassed :D."
-1,"The case fits well on the phone and looked great when I first put it on. However, after only 2 weeks of use (my phone is carried in my purse and has bever been dropped) it looks pretty scratched up and the textured soft finish is wearing off. The exterior finish had not held up well to minimal use and I'm very disappointed in this purchase."
0,"The charger cable lasted for only 2 months(it stopped to work suddenly, in perfect conditions), terrible quality, and after that, I have to use a Chromecast cable, which is not the same, it is terribly slow to charge it.<br /><br />Some applications will crush or not work as the iOS version, for example Audible not only crush but it makes the operating system as well. Waze looks and works terrible at Android(not sure if this only happens in this phone of every single Android)<br /><br />It has plenty of ASUS useless applications.<br />It is ok for its low price, but you will not get the quality of an iPhone on a ASUS Zenfone(just in case if you are a iOS user, do not switch to Android)<br /><br />The screen material is also very low profile, my Zenfone 2 got a scratch from... basically nothing, bad quality, I got to buy a temperate glass for it.<br />Any way, consider invest $200 in another smartphone"
1,I love the watch! Getting my emails and calls without having to carry my phone in my hand is so convenient. But you have to be within range of your cell phone
1,Fits perfectly no need to buy a new radar.
-1,Poor quality and not worth the money.  I feels like cardboard.  The only reason I am not returning it is that it will cost me $6 for shipping so I am only getting $3 refund.  I do not know how this product got so many 5-stars.
1,"So happy with the glass cover. I had a lifeproof case on my iPhone for two years while I was under contract but it was pretty beat. I wanted to keep my phone and get a new case and screen protector. I love it it's so clear not big and test I have dropped my phone and the glass isn't cracked. The phone is good and the screen protector is still perfect. This is my new go to product when I do decide to upgrade. The only downside, is on the iPhone 6 there is a space between the screen protector and the edge of the case. I'm hoping they will update and fix that"
1,"For me the effect seems more obvious with the wake-up energize sequence than with the calming effect. I have primarily used it for the mid-morning slump and afternoon slump, however, it won't counteract a true sleep deficit."
1,Very Good case
1,I ordered my case and wasn't too sure about it because some of the comments but I LOVE IT!! Yes is so good got it right on time with two day shipping and in top of that that it comes with a screen protector and a pen for easy texting. I will recommend and it makes my iPhone more prettier.
1,Great case! Just wish it had it's own magnet to automatically turn phone on/off upon opening/closing. Otherwise it works perfectly for what I need it for.
1,"This works great, I bought one from the cell store for $25 for my Samsung S5 and this is every bit as good.  I was a bit nervous installing myself, but was easy to do.  So far no air bubble issues after 3 weeks of use, will update if there are future issues.  The Tempered Glass is a MUST for cell phones."
1,"I bought it for my wife, she love this case."
-1,"Like many other reviews, my set will not hold a charge after about a month of use. When they worked they sounded great &#60;assuming my phone was close enough to send\receive signal&#62; for music. I did get the audio drop out here and there when I was biking but it was never anything too bad or that would require a reparing. Forget about using these for a phone call since no one could ever hear me clearly when trying to use the built in microphone. Unfortunately now I get to throw these away because I am not able to charge the battery. Save your money and buy something that is better quality."
1,"I've been wanting to buy a selfie stick ever since it became popular and now I am happy to buy and use this particular selfie stick. Since I got it I was very impressed and I feel like it is a very high quality and nicely stylish product. It is also very simple to use even for me (I am not technical type) and work with my iPhone with no issue. Overall, I am satisfied with the product and honestly I couldn't find anything to complain about at all. Thank you for this great product!"
-1,"I bought this because the price was right and it did not look too bulky.  However, the case keeps the power button down and the phone keeps restarting as a result.  Not even worth returning, so I am just out the money.  The materials are okay, and the clear plastic was neat, but obviously that is irrelevant given the power button pressure."
1,"The phone case was beautiful but I did not get a strap for the phone as pictured on the screen if you can,can you plz send me a strap for the phone case,  Thank you !"
-1,Doesnt work well at all thru via cell its real hazy watchingh anything off of phone ... dont buy it
1,very nice
-1,"Pretty disappointed. I installed on my 33' motorhome. It seems like any little thing causes it to fuzz up the image (static from the wireless reception.) It's cheap and hopefully as we've all learned, you get what you pay for. I just didn't feel like spending several hundred dollars on a system. It'll do but if you want a reliable rear camera wireless system, this isn't the one for you."
-1,"The pentalobe star screwdriver is too big and can't be used to extract the screws near the lightning charger. I tried calling &#34;customer service&#34; twice at 206.607.1333, no answer, &#34;The voicemail box is full, please try your call again later.&#34;"
1,Easy to put on and works like a charm.
1,It works as advertising.
-1,Very unhappy with purchase. Case did not even fit my phone (galaxys5 ). Buttons didn't even line up and case look like it fit and iphone.  All info said this what i ordered . Had to go to Verizion  store and purchase a case for a much higher price . I will put that one in the junk box and chalk it up as lesson learned . Sorry VERY UNHAPPY !!!
-1,"I bought this as a present for my 8 year old daughter. I spent ages downloading MP4s to put on it but the only video formats it plays is .AMV and .MTV...Good look finding those. Even when I downloaded a converter; it still wont recognise the files. It's hard to work, it's very quiet and it crackles. I thought I'd grabbed myself a bargin, but I was wrong. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
0,I think this would work great if I did not have a case on my phone.  I have an Otter Box case which I think is too heavy causing the vents in my car to sag and the phone/holder to slip off over bumps.  I ended up going with a dash-mounted holder because of this.
1,Fit my iPhone 6 like a glove.
1,"fast delivery, Looks beautiful! Very happy with it!"
1,"Great device however, it's kept kicking me off the Bluetooth."
1,The real deal!
1,Excellent Thank You..
1,Neat addition for my vivofti2
1,"Great product, and shipping by Amazon.  Currently charging the following with no issues:  Android phone, Android Tablet, Iphone 5, Ipad Air, Ipad Air2.  Works great, and the blue backlight are a plus at night, but mostly covered once you plug your cable into the usb jack."
1,Works very well and is very stylish. You have to center the phone exactly on it though and confirm that the light changes from red to blue.
1,A lot more durable than the original apple lightning cable. Amazon's warranty is also great. My cable messed up within a year and they sent me a full refund to purchase another one.
0,"The cover is great. The belt clip isn't the greatest for me, it always pops off of my belt while I'm working. I do construction so I could be up higher than a phone could handle the drop so I don't use it any more. Just put phone in pocket.like I said cover seems very durable"
0,Its a little cheaply made compared to the old kenwood decks. But it works fine.
-1,It's tough and looks nice but it does not protect your screen if it were to fall face first. The case sits flush to the front of the phone which is the most important part. Nothing else seems worth it in comparison to the biggest flaw it has. Wish I could return it.
1,"Excellent battery pack, huge life. built very well and feel solid. I picked it up as a lightning deal for $14 and have used it for almost a year now."
0,I purchased this item in May.  It's late August and it has already broken (the plastic suction cup that makes it stick to the windshield broke off of the back of the mount.  It was a great product while it lasted....but it does not appear that I can return for a replacement any more.
1,Bought this to take on our trip to Alaska.  Thought it might be fun to use.  Hoping to get pics of ourselves with the beautiful scenery in the background.  Worked great.  It was light and convenient to carry around in a back pack or pocket. It was pretty simply to use once I got the hang of it.
1,"This came with a lifetime warranty and broke one day after the 30 day return time. I cannot find a way to return it either through Amazon or through Wildtek. I am highly disappointed in both companies.  After posting this review, Wildtek contacted me and honored the warranty. I appreciate the effort made by Wildtek and will recommend the company to other users. I"
1,"I returned my garmin dashcam, and change it with zero edge , and i am very happy with it..some has problem with mounting /keeps on collapsing but i suggest MOUNT IT ON YOUR REARVIEW MIRROR, check this item (iSaddle CH214) $9 in Amazon,  check it if it will fit your vehicle rearview mirror , its perfect on my Honda pilot..<br />I'll definetly recommend it !"
1,"Sturdy, looks great, takes a few days to get use to size. Nice product."
-1,"Flimsy junk don't waste your money, they say they fit the 1999 vw but they don't, I actually found some localy and when I compared them they were not even close."
1,These are a must for power users. I have 3 total!
1,"Great case.  Not so great screen protector.  I don't like the included protector because it doesn't stay stuck to the screen, so air pockets form and it has a &#34;bubbly&#34; feel when you're pressing on it.  Also, it doesn't have a slot for the microSD slot.  So if you want to add or remove the SD card, you have to take apart the case.  I'm going to use a razor blade and cut out an opening in the plastic for the SD slot.  I find the case difficult to separate/install/uninstall.  I broke my the outside half of my first case from removing it and reinstalling it several times, but I was probably pretty rough with it.<br /><br />I think its a great case, super durable when installed and looks nice.  I've dropped my phone several times on hard surfaces and its still good as new.  Good edges for phone calls and holding while typing.  My wife has same phone and she has another popular case and its ok but this one is better.<br /><br />IMO, best idea is to cut out the original protector and buy an aftermarket one, the kind that 'sticks' to the phone's screen.  Then re-assembled the case and it's perfect.  To remove the included screen, I used a razor blade and an old rag with some paint thinner.  Used the razor blade to cut off the screen and scrape off the glue from the backside of the case's edges.  Then removed any residual glue with the rag and a little bit of paint thinner.  Took about 10 minutes.  IMO was totally worth it.  No more bubbles and can use any screen protector you like.<br /><br />Case gets five stars, but overall four because of no sd card slot and included screen protector.  Still best case out there IMO even with the extra work.  I've bought two of them now and have tried three different cases and still think this ones the best."
-1,Terrible.  Plugged it in and it doesn't work. Garbage save your money.
0,"I would like to see some sort of secure closure piece on future versions. The flap doesn't always close flat on my phone automatically, so I have to set my phone down upside down, which defeats the purpose of the window.<br /><br />I do love the color though (although my fiance says it's old grandma color. Hah). And I like that it's thin. Time will tell on how durable it is, as I've only had it a couple days at home. As I go out and about or to work, hopefully it will hold up. :)"
1,"I believe this phone has what I have been looking for. It's super affordable and feels durable and hasn't caused any problems for the couple of months that I have owned it. For the price versus the specs, this phone is by far worth it and every peeny involved."
1,Fits my iPhone 6 snugly.
1,Works great the cutouts are a little off but nothing moving it a little further to one side won't fix.
1,These are great! Have 2 of them!
1,It really allows the edge to be seen and looks really slick on this new phone. It's not very heavy either.
-1,What are the SPECS?  SCREEN SIZE etc.....
1,"had my plastic screen protector for a while and decided to replace with this, as long as your screen is free of any lint or dust this protector should stick to your phone perfectly! i didn't had to squeeze any bubbles out . also the products that comes in the package really helps with the cleaning."
1,Great cables. Do their job and the right angle connectors are a plus.
1,"I received this type C HDTV Adapter cable, and it was great! just to specify the cable doesn't fit the 13 in MacBook. The quality of the cable is very durable, it's a definetely must have item and I highly recommend this product. I am greatful to have had purchased this item at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.<br />Enjoy! (:"
1,Great Product
0,"They work great, but not the most comfortable ear buds in the world. I bought them for TV watching, but have decided to only use them while mowing. Cuts down on noise and I can tolerate the discomfort for an hour while I mow."
1,Great little set up.  Does what it is advertised to do.
0,"Quality better than expected.  One week after i received it, I dropped my $800 Iphone 6 and not a scratch in my phone or cover. I thought being it was a plastic cover it would crack but didnt."
-1,The worse i've bought ever
1,"It's lightweight, very comfortable, and can even fit my phone with a thin case on it."
1,"This bluetooth performs exceptionally well in all respects.<br />1.  Fit and comfort. Exceeds my expectations in both categories.  Bluetooth comes with three ear buds (small, medium & large).  It takes a few minutes to get the hang of putting the buds on and taking them off the bluetooth but you can then experiment with all three to find the right fit.  At first I tried to wedge it in because it did not seem reasonable to expect it to stay in unless it was wedged in.  This product is designed to sit in your ear.  You do not need to put it in like a cork.  For me it fits perfectly with the bud facing back and slightly down.  Very comfortable, I can literally leave it in all day with no discomfort.  Buds are very soft and pliable<br />2.  Range-excellent.  I can leave my phone plugged in and walk outdoors<br />3.  Sound quality. Very good. Can be used to listen to books or music but good buds or headset would be preferable for music.<br />4.  Battery and recharge.  Very easy to recharge with the charging station.  Recharge lasts the full 6 hours and only takes 90 minutes.<br />5.  Bells & Whistles.  As with other plantronics this one works with voice commands and announces callers by name from contacts<br />Highly recommended, does not fall out of your ear and does not need to sit outside of your ear."
1,Excellent - as usual with Amazon - never been disappointed!
0,Code not working
-1,I ordered these to install in the front fairing of my Kawasaki Nomad. I wanted to see if I would get a bit more base and directed music flow as indicated in some forum posts out there. I had to trim a bit to have them fit which was OK but otherwise they did nothing to the level or change of the music. Nothing more than molded foam.
1,Great build quality and lightweight. I love the case and cable it comes with because it makes it really portable. I charged my phone with it and even had enough power to continue charging my controller while playing games on my PS4. I might be buying a few more.
1,I haven't learned how to fully use it 😆<br />But this is awsome wonderfull_ th you.much thsnks
1,"Just as described, light weight and did the job for my 11 year old to wear to summer camp."
1,"it was a perfect ,great."
1,"Great case, easy to put on and take off. Nice that is flat so level app is quite accurate. It is nice having the clear back so you can see the phone itself"
1,Charges fast.  Minimal heating.
1,I really like this product. I feel more secure handling phone.
0,WORKED OK!
1,The nylon cable helps with that nasty problem of breakage and it's a great color! I received a discount on my order for a fair review.
1,"Bought it as a gift to my wife for her new phone.. She loved it.. And I often see her using the pockets for cards, when she doesn't want to bring her purse"
1,"I've tried all sorts of bluetooth headphones for running, including some of the more expensive ones. These are the best I've found. They are extremely comfortable, the volume is more than adequate (many bluetooth headphones have volume issues), the batter life is good, and they are easy to use. I had an issue with the pair I received and I was rushed a replacement pair. It was an excellent customer experience. If you are a runner, these are perfect."
1,"Easy Installation and Love it!  Sound quality is perfect.  HOWEVER, I have experienced the unit locking up on numerous occasion since installed less than a week ago.  It will randomly stop responding to controls.  The music continues to play and change tracks, however, I'm unable to change tracks from the handlebar controls and if it switch to another source [i.e. FM, AM] and try to switch back to CD - it won't.  Its like my radio doesn't see the unit plugged into it anymore.  If i turn the key switch to Off and then back on, I am then able to switch to CD and control the unit again.  Anyone else experience this?"
1,Excellent quality and 100% iPhone compatible.
1,Good quality at the price.
1,"My daughter absolutely love these, they are so clear and have so many neat features she loves."
1,Fits perfect....just hard to put it on
-1,Does not work with iphone 4 OS7 or mac )S 10.8 .
1,"This was a great buy, have one shorter cable and one longer cable, gives me me more uses."
1,"I seriously love this thing. If you're worried about the friction added by some screen protectors, look no further. This protector is buttery smooth. I haven't compared to the phone's bare glass, but switched to this protector from a softer plastic protector (which came free with my phone). I couldn't be happier with the improvement (and I wasn't expecting it to be so noticeable). And unlike with the other protector, I don't see any signs of scratching (even after a few weeks, the old one was looking sorry--better than scratches on the phone's glass of course).  This works with the [[ASIN:B00I3UWEIA Galaxy S5 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy S5 - Electric Blue (SGP10753)]], there's only a slight gap between the protector and the case, so coverage is also pretty good.  Note that this is a flexible but fairly hard plastic material, I believe &#34;ballistic glass&#34; is a synthetic (real glass is too rigid to stand up to much punishment).  When mounting, I suggest lining it up with the screen protector's backing still in place. Use scotch tape to attach the bottom edge of the screen protector to the bottom of the phone, lift the protector off from the top (without disturbing the tape, or else it might become misaligned), do any additional wiping/cleaning, then remove the backing and lower it back into place.  Update 1/12/2017: I've been using these regularly for awhile now. They've cracked a couple of times, probably saving my screen from being damaged, and I'm on my third one now. I drop my phone a lot, sometimes multiple times a day (usually from just a couple of feet off the ground). These screen protectors plus the Spigen case have kept things mostly protected, although one bad fall put a ding in the bottom bezel (which is not touched by this screen protector)."
1,Fantastic Value
1,Good quality
1,Very pleased
1,"Good product. I drop my iPhone all the time, so far it has protected my phone about 20 times!!! Not bulky & not ugly to look at!"
-1,"Not wild about this product.  After being in the sun for a few hours, it appeared the panels began to delaminate."
-1,"I would have given 5 stars the beginning, however now I can not use them. Whether I am on the phone or listening to music, all I hear are muffled sounds. I had to order a different brand. Plus these don't stay in your ear all that well"
0,I'm loving this handlebar holder. It fits perfectly. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this brand for other phones as well.  Update: After almost TWO MONTHS of road use this phone holder broke off its base. I guess the normal road vibrations just took a toll on this holder. I am going to have to take away 2 stars. What a shame. I really liked this thing!
1,"This low profile power adaptor provides two USB connectors so we can charge two phones, phone and iPad, etc.  I like the low profile -- when you don't have anything plugged into it the cover on the power plug folds down almost closed (I have another non-low profile adaptor and it sticks out of the power plug like a short hot dog)"
1,I bought my Jawbone Up Move at Costco. I went back to buy another for a friend And 2 for my daughters! So obviously I want more to share this awesome little device with peoe I love.  Love that I don't need to charge it. My fit bit was a pain in the butt to charge and wasn't accurate when the battery was low. I also love the app for reminders and advice. Don't LOVE the food tracker but I am truly using this for the activity monitor. Keeps you aware of just how active we really are - and you can also move more if you see you are low for a days goal.
1,Pretty & Sparkly
1,"Bought back in April.  Yes occasionally it does make high pitch noise, like a mic at karaoke night, but it is not often and it does stop on its own. Yes, it is a BIG case, but the iphone6+ is a BIG phone!  Yes, the rubber nubs that close off the charger and headphone areas are a pain in the butt and it is best to open them using the little chili pepper thing that comes with the case. Yes, they eventually broke off, so the phone is no longer waterproof. Yes, I have dropped it at least 7 times while in this case, No it has not suffered any damage during this time. Yes, the stand broke off last month, so it only lasted around 4 months of constant open close use. Yes, the chili pepper clastic thing is stupid, but it does work as intended, and i have had it tied to the core that it came with to hang off the corner. No, i have not lost the chili pepper this whole time. NO, it does not easily slide out of your pocket, front or back. Again, i think the phone size is more of an issue there, that the case. YES, you can use the thumbprint option, and it does work well, until month 4, it has started to wrinkle up and it takes a few tries to get it to read your print now. Can't give it a 5 since it is falling apart now, but giving it a 4 because it was $30 and it has lasted almost 6mo and has protected my phone form falls."
1,work well although no instructions
1,Works great
1,Would be 5 stars but the case is already lifting from the seal
1,"This is by far the best selfie stick I've come across.  It's very well constructed and easy to use.  I had just one failure.  The small coil spring that clamps the phone keeper slipped off its perch.  I haven't been able to retrieve it.  However, I found that rubber band is a easy fix."
1,great product
-1,Horrible
1,Excellent product and value!
1,Works.
1,Received product and it was exactly as described. The charger is well made and very easy to use. I am very pleased with my purchase. This is one of my 3 Ravpower products. I have never been disappointed with how well they work.
1,I wish I would have bought 2 of these now. It charges quickly and I get 3-4 phone charges from it.
1,good
-1,Flimsy back...hard to get the case on my phone...gets dirty very quickly and unable to clean
1,Great little walkie talkies for the prrice. It will go through batteries pretty fast.
1,A bit bulky (interfering with the view out the windshield) but works as promised.
1,"Solved my issue of charging my iPad, personal and work cell phone without a powerstrip. I Velcroed the PowerPort to the back of my nightstand and with some cable management, works perfectly and looks great without wires freely hanging everywhere."
1,Definitely  the best choice . A great product at a great price!!
1,"I've had this case for 2 months. I've taken it out the case at most 2x. I love this case its durable and it's saved my phone from many drops. It has a smooth backing to it. It will slide off all surfaces when placed on its back. The silicone piece does grip to some surfaces when phone is placed face down. I haven't lost any of the diamonds and the color hasn't gotten darker from wear and tear. My only down side is I already need to replace it because the silicone has stretched out. I wish the hard plastic wasn't just covering the sides because it may have prevented the top and bottom from stretching out so much. The stretching does cause the phone to loosen out of the phone case all together, which in turn has made me have to take my phone out and put the case back on correctly more often. Annoying! I guess 2 months of durability and low cost out weights the slow painful death of my precious phone case."
1,100% satisfaction
1,Great deal and fast delivery!
1,"I didn't end up using it in the rain, but my niece got a hold of it and it is the perfect mock phone for a baby!"
1,Durable case.  Has good charge and protects from drops.
1,It works
1,Awesome
1,Works perfectly! Very pleased with this transaction.
1,Very good.
0,It's very well made but not that easy for me to put on.  I have arthritis so that may be the problem.
0,Love many of its features however it is slow and so are the downloads with it.
1,EXCELENT!!!!
1,Great Little Product for the price.
1,great sound quality; hold a charge;  not the most comfortable ear piece.
1,"Outstanding iPhone,like it.!"
1,"Worked as promised. I had one go bad and the seller did a great job of replacing it, no questions asked. A nice change from $20 Apple cables."
1,love it! fits perfectly.
1,good
1,"Looks great, can barely tell the film is there.  Haven't dropped my phone yet so unsure of the protective qualities."
1,"I used the phone in India.Right size to carry around and needed no alterations.Excellent reception,and clear sound.<br />Used for a month and quite happy with it."
1,"Bought this for a trip to the UK and was very happy we did.  Found a lot of the hotel rooms didn't haven't outlets near the bed so it was very handy to be able to charge with the external battery.  We have also found it extremely useful back in the states.  My husband likes to cycle and he uses it on his long bike rides since the Map my ride app drains his Iphone 5 battery pretty quickly.  It is on the larger side but that has not been a problem for us at all.  Our family loves it and my daughter just asked if she can have one for Christmas.  If size and weight aren't an issue for you I highly recommend this one.  For us, having more charges was more important than having a compact external battery."
1,Best case I have ever owned. Completely protects your phone from breaking due to shocks. I have literally dropped my phone a million times and this case does not fail at keeping me protected. Sincerely thankful.
1,"5 stars ONLY because I want to be heard. DONT buy this case because it is not as shown in the picture. In this picture the florals color is hightened but when u received the package it's not. It's light and pale. Also, it isn't smooth like someone actually painted the thing and tiny frozen paint is stuck on it. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this!"
1,"Very cute case, I loved its protection . The only thing I didn't like is the charger doesn't fit in the phone with the case on."
1,awesome quality night light for this price point...
1,"Arrived on time and as described. Great product, thank you so much!"
1,Fits description
1,"I really enjoy this radio. but the down fall is that I don't know how to program this radio.<br />The price is great, and it's great for airsoft games or any other activities."
1,Plastic gets a little ruffled but still has great touch sensitivity!
1,"Very great case, fits perfectly and looks nice and sleek."
-1,none of the 3 cords I received work with my iPhone 5.  No other cords I own have issues. This happens with all 3 iPhone 5 in my house. Too bad
1,Son wanted this to replace his broken phone. He is very satisfied.
1,Just what I expected - works perfectly
-1,This car charger would not charge my iPhone 6. It said accessory not compatible with this device on my screen then I plugged it in and it wouldn't charge.
-1,This otterbox was a lifesaver but it broke late week when I wad just touching the rubber part. I was barely touching it and it snapped. I can't return it or replace it because the 30 days have passed :(
-1,"The metal bit that charges the ipad, snapped off in the ipad, about 2 weeks after we bought it."
1,Such a clean and professional looking case. And holds up extremely well.
-1,Did not fit my phone securely especially around the point for recharging phone.
1,So far these cables work well!
1,Beyond my expection
1,"This was the perfect upgrade to my Aux cord mess.  This device paired easily with my iPhone and the sound quality is a notch better than I expected.  The controls have a nice form factor.  The buttons can be identified by feel, which is important while driving.  I was so impressed that I bought a second one for my other car.  Great value."
1,They work great!!! The price is fantastic....
-1,"Would have given this item 5 stars, had great battery life loved magnetic heads!! However, headphones quit working right at 37 day. They no longer charge or power on."
1,Great way to store headset !! plus it charges !! COOL
-1,It wasnt the same color in the picture it's more green if any thing.
0,"Looks good. Sturdy product, but don't expect to receive 3 different &#34;parts&#34; to this item, one of which is totally useless as the pocket opens but cannot hold anything. The space to hold the phone is so &#34;roomy&#34; that the phone can easily slip out and fall to the ground because there is nothing to hold it in place. In short, the photos are very deceptive, each one is taken at a different angle - everything is one unit. Clever marketing, anyway."
-1,LG It worked OK but it need glue to make everything work right
-1,ripoff
1,"This was so easy to put on and fit my perfect! I have been using it a couple months now and really like it. I have not dropped my phone with it on so I don't know how the protection in that way will be, I'm hopinh good. I had dropped my phone three time before I put this on it. I think maybe it had made my phone easier to grip. Does take up more room in my pocket but that's ok."
-1,does not work  will take it up with the seller.
-1,"There are better priced, more user-friendly products available relative to this product."
1,My previous glass screen protector (from another company) was put on my phone at the ATT store.  I was afraid that I would mess up if I attempted to change the screen protector myself.  The one I bought at the store would've cost over $30 if it had not been for my credit.  I was weary about purchasing a cheap glass screen protector. This screen protector has exceeded my expectations.  The Maxboost website has a great video for how to install and the product included everything needed.  Hopefully it last a while.
0,Battery life doesn't last long. I would recommend buying a bigger size.
1,"Charges 3 phones at rated speeds simultaneously. I charge my Moto X, iphone 5s, and zenfone 2 all with this adapter and it works great. It gets slightly warm put when putting out that much wattage you can't really expect it to not heat up a bit. I recommend this so much I bought two."
0,thanks
1,Great cords
1,Great holder for my LG G Vista. Very durable and protective. Great price.
1,good
-1,"Just because there is no option for &#34;zero&#34; stars.<br /><br />Like so many others here, I mistakenly assumed that a product labeled &#34;Perfect For: MP3 Players/Portable DVD Players/Mobile Media Managers&#34; would actually be compatible with those products. Nothing, repeat, NOTHING that I have has a 2.5mm earphone receptacle. Now I'm stuck with this piece of crap, because returning it costs more than the refund."
-1,"This works great, until you try to readjust it. Then the protector cracks. Overall if you can get the screen on well in one shot I recommend this, especially since the protector has a good 'feel' when on."
-1,Scratched very easy
0,its okay!!! or my arms are too thick for it !!!  I would give it 5 stars if it was for women or someone with thin arms.
0,"Works well enough for what I use it for (spare/backup phone) but has a number of annoyances.<br /><br />Good: Solid construction, nice textured back for grip. Call quality seems okay. I don't use any of the other features like games, camera, bluetooth, etc so can't really comment on those. Battery life is great. Very small/portable, easy to throw in a spare pocket.<br /><br />Meh:<br />-Phone makes three loud beeps every few minutes when the battery is low, even on silent mode as far as I can tell. Haven't found a way to turn this off.<br />--Web browser button on the main screen with no way to disable it. Could see myself accidentally hitting this and eating up prepaid minutes. Tracfone's data is pretty expensive.<br /><br />Bad:<br /><br />-The &#34;flip&#34; part of the flip phone snaps closed very quickly and forcefully and have more than once pinched my thumb in the top corners of the phone when trying to close it with one hand.<br />-Tracfone charges you fractions of minutes for text messages, but only if you actually open them on the phone. On this particular phone, it shows you the sender number (or name if you have them in your contacts list) but *not* what time the message was received without opening the text message and incurring the minute deduction. I use this phone as a secondary phone where text messages are sent to both my tracfone and my email account, and a lot of times it's difficult to tell if the messages that end up on my phone are new or not (may have already read them on my email). Have wasted prepaid minutes finding this out.<br />-Occasionally advertisements for extra minutes will be sent to your phone as messages. These look like text messages at first and your phone will vibrate/make a noise, but when you open them they're a special type of message and you're not charged minutes for reading them. But still annoying when the phone makes you think you have a text message and it's actually just a Tracfone advertisement."
1,Great quality.
-1,Wasn't worth it.
1,Update: 9/10/2015<br /><br />A replacement was shipped by the seller unprompted. The replacement functions as it should.  This seller stands behind their product.  I feel confident that the initial unit I received was defective.<br /><br />worked for one charge.  Now it will add about 4% to my Samsung s5 and it is dead.  Look elsewhere.
1,"If you buy a Garmin, you have to buy this too.  Period.  YOU NEED THIS.  Ignore your innate desire to save money.<br /><br />I had a Garmin before and balked at spending so much extra money on top of an already expensive purchase.  I thought the included mount (the type that sticks on the windshield) would be perfectly sufficient.  I was very, very WRONG.  This is not just a preference; it is a matter of safety.  The windshield mounts do not work reliably enough.  They fall off all the time, no matter how well you attach them.  I had finally gotten mine to stick and then was driving on a crowded highway when the mount suddenly came loose and tumbled right at me.  Potentially, this could have caused a major accident; luckily, I only swerved slightly as a result.  However, that incident scared me and convinced me to invest in a good mount.  Frankly, I also felt that if I had spent so much on the Garmin itself, all that money would be wasted if the Garmin committed suicide by breaking free from a windshield mount.<br /><br />This particular mount is very easy to attach to the Garmin and also comes off easily when you need to take the Garmin inside for updating.  It has enough weight to it that even when you swerve suddenly because of an idiot on the road, the Garmin doesn't budge.  It's also nice being able to shift it around a bit depending on where the sun is shining in.  I think the safety considerations alone make this worth the expense, but the additional convenience and ease of use make it an even better purchase."
1,"best screen protector ever way better then the cheap plastic sheets we have all been using I will buy one of these for all my needs (phones ,tablets Ipads )"
1,Excellent
0,5 for 99 cent!  They are a good value for what you pay. But I no longer buy cheap screen covers.  Spend a little more and get a nice glass one.
1,Worked great and saved us lots of money as Verizon did not carry replacement battery for our phones. Would have cost us New phones.
-1,It said it wouldn't bubble. It did.
1,"Great concept, love having all the different cord styles all in 1 convenient cord. Took this traveling and it was so easy to charge our devices. My only grip is when 2 devices were plugged the charge was slow for one or not charging at all until the other device was fully charged. Wish you could charge multiple devices quickly at once but besides that I love it."
-1,Did not work right out of the package. Had some dirt stuck to the micro usb port. Had to return......Very disappointing!
1,"I have been using the vibe for awhile now and I love it. It doesn't feel overpowering or impairing like energy drinks or alcohol or rx meds. I don't enjoy the side effects of either and tend to stay far away from them. Which is super important to me bc I am a stay at home mom trying to keep up with some really rambunctious kids but also keep my sanity. Sure, after a really long day with crabby toddlers I slap a calm strip on and feel like I have been sent to cloud 9. No glass of wine can do this, and I am so happy it's my own body's response rather than alcohol destroying my body. I leave the settings at 50% bc much higher I get the tingle feeling in my scalp. Otherwise, no issues. This thing is awesome!"
1,Great looking case!  Fits great and sticks out about an inch past the screen to provide plenty of protection in the case of a drop.  UPDATE: Revising to 4 stars because I have the Ceramic White back and there are small but visible &#34;polka dots&#34; that make the phone appear dirty (see photo).  Apparently all the clear cases do this but just a warning to those with the Ceramic White case.
1,"I have been using this continuously for several weeks and am completely satisfied. This is a very high quality product. It doesn't heat up at all even when charging all devices simultaneously which include multiple I phone models, and multiple I pad models. It charges fast even when all devices are connected. It is hands down the best charger I have ever owned."
1,"It is very safe and easy to install, comes with a clear instruction, plus all the elements to make a good installation; I did not like it a bit smaller than the monitor, and it was difficult to correct if you put evil.It is seen to be very strong, and will prevent scratches and falls."
1,excelent
1,Works great!
-1,Did not work for me. My iPhone kept falling.
1,Thank you so much super fast delivery. Only took 2 day to get to my house.... and works gr8
-1,Didn't work.
-1,If you work out and sweat daily then these overpriced earbuds are not for you. I did not get mine from Amazon I got mine from Best Buy with a 2 year extended warranty and that was only a month and a half ago and they've broken on me twice already I feel like I spend more time driving to Best Buy then working out!
1,"ordered for colleague in West Africa, he seems to be enjoying it"
1,"Strong magnet, simple to use. Material made of metal and plastic, well made overall."
1,"Excellent product. Arrived quickly, setup was extremely easy and quality is clear. Using LG G3."
1,"At first I didn't think this case would be too good at keeping water out but boy was I wrong. Works just as it should and item was exactly what was described. I gave this case 4 stars instead of 5 because you can't use earphones while the case is on. That is the only negative I could find about this case.<br /><br />Also, I was sent this case at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. Definitely recommend."
1,ok
1,"As described, great price and fast shipping"
1,Note 3 and it works great
1,"Bought it for my girlfriend and she uses it all the time, looks nice on her phone."
-1,Broke within two days and got stuck in my phone
0,Not very compatible with iPad1
1,Awesome! Saved my Nexus 7 from being discontinued.
1,thank you so much
1,Just as exoevted
1,good
1,Very Satisfied!
0,"Case did protext against a fall or two, but it is too flimsy and sticks too much to be functional in someone who wears jeans that fit them.  If you wore some 90s jncos, (or had a purse, I suppose) then this case would be a pretty good case.  I am keeping it as a stand-by."
1,"This case is awesome, full protection at a fraction of the cost"
1,I received these in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />They arrived promptly and as described.<br /><br />These cables arrived in easy to open packaging and was simple to assembly.  My IPhone 6 didn't have a problem connecting and charging with these cables.  They are thicker than some of the less expensive models I've owned in the past.  Love it and would recommend it to anyone.
1,The WeFix website had many tutorials.  It took some time but I was able to fix it.  There was one small piece which I couldn't figure out but I saw it in another video on the website.  After that everything went well.  The phone looked and worked good as new.
0,The stuff that I received was a great
1,Still working good. I think this one is better quality than what samsung uses.
-1,The top and bottom don't stay hooked together.
1,Works as advertised. Very convenient.
1,Very good design and much cheaper than you can find in Apple Store.
1,Great case! Thank you!
1,Great. Love it. Thank you.
1,This case fit perfectly and it was easy to put on. I love it.
1,It's the real deal.  Don't settle for a cheap charger that last two months.  This one does not flicker or lose connection.  You won't be disappointed.
1,"I bought this desktop charger for a cruise that our family took. The cruise line did not allow power strips, so this desktop charger worked perfectly and replaced the multitude of chargers in our home after the cruise. We use the charger for all our devices; iPhone 6, iPhone 4, Kindle Fire and Nook."
-1,Two of the three cables failed to function within one month.  Not recommended.
1,"Yeah it fits perfect adds great cushion if your phone drops and lands on it's corners or back, you should invest in a sturdy shock absorbant screen protector also"
1,fits true but can't use any other case on the top of it.
1,"Great to find a battery for this old phone (I don't want to upgrade), but the new batt does not hold a charge as long as I would expect from a new batt."
-1,"I had thought these were going to be great chargers for our phones and tablet.  They aren't that great. I'm disappointed with them. They just don't charge or they charge mega slow. But for the price I paid, I guess I can't complain. I will say this though, delivery was fast and efficient."
1,ive had these before i love them
1,"I love my new iPhone case, it's exactly what I wanted. Delivery was so fast, I would recommend Amazon to my family & friends ❤️"
1,Ok!!!
1,This is the second phone I've purchased a Ballistic case for and they are great.
1,Wife likes it.
0,"The concept is great, but this case did not hold together very well. I bought it for my daughter and she had it a little over a month and it started coming apart at the seams and the plastic piece that actually holds the phone broke."
1,good product at a great price
-1,Very disappointed.  This was likely a counterfeit item.  I bought 2 batteries. One could not hold a charge for more than a couple hours. The other had only about 70% capacity of a regular battery and a self discharge rate that made it unusable as backup.  I am disappointed with Amazon on this purchase.
-1,"Terrible pieceo f junk. Has never worked to actually charge a phone. Phone will occasionally make a 'hissing' sound when it seems like it is lining up with the device to charge. Battery level does not increase. Attempted to charge Nexus 5, 6, & 7 with the device and none would charge.<br /><br />Avoid this."
1,a very good case for the price range.
1,Bought 7 for whole family friends!<br /><br />My son dropped his phone TWICE - cracked the screen..<br /><br />This effectively &#34;fixes&#34; the phone - just replace the top screen and this product helps &#34;squeeze&#34; the crack shut...
1,"Arrived on time, looked like the picture shown on amazon. No issues"
0,The item did not work as expected - but the company was awesome to work with!!
0,The case is OK. Didnt feel great and added unwanted girth to the phone.
1,A very good cable.....works for both Samsung an and my iPhone. ..best
-1,"it didn't fit perfectly, my volume button doesn't work properly. It adjust on its on the volume and when I press on it it dosent work to turn up only to turn down."
1,Just as described A+
1,"GOT THIS PHONE FOR MY MOTHER AND SHE LOVES IT.THE LARGE NUMBERS MAKE IT EASY TO USE AND THE RING TONE IS VERY LOUD.SHE ALSO LIKES THE HANDY LCD LIGHT WHICH SHE USES TO GO OUTSIDE TO LET OUT THE DOGS AT NIGHT.IT'S RUBBERIZED BODY MAKES IT EASY TO GRIP,AND IT FEELS VERY STURDY."
1,"I have to say I am a bit impressed at the solid construction of this aluminum stand. It has a sturdy feel to it. It is adjustable for angle, making it easily viewable on my desk whether I place it on the low portion of the desk, or up higher near my monitor. The adjustment button is solid and holds well so it will not fall. The rubber feet give it good traction. It is painted with an &#34;Apple like&#34; color and texture so while it does not match my IMac perfectly, it is close enough where it does not look out of place next to my monitor.<br /><br />The only negative is that I cannot charge my IPhone 6Plus or IPad while it is sitting upright on this stand. I can turn the device sideways while it charges. If there was room to have the cable attached while sitting upright this stand would be perfect for me. Yes, that is a minor issue, but this is a review so I am just stating my thoughts. Overall this is a great product.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes."
1,Love it color AWESOME  :) :) :)
1,Love this case!  It fits my Samsung S6 great.
-1,"Phone case is very thin. It also is very smooth which makes it hard to not drop it every time I pick it up. It is a very cute phone case with a really nice design, but if you're going for something that is both cute and durable, I wouldn't recommend this."
1,"Great case, love the design."
1,"I love the phone except it doesn't have UBER app functionality as of  August 31, 2015. (I tried the mobile web version, but it doesn't work.  Error message says to download the app.)  Hopefully this comes soon, but for now I'm stranded.  I will update my review as soon as I find a solution.  I might be close.  I tried using the mobile website recently and it might be working.  I will verify as soon as possible (9/4/2015)  To research this issue, search for mobilityarena article uber-app-for-android-not-working-any-more-on-bb10."
-1,Didn't work as I expected. Hard to figure out charging and back up usage.
1,Very impressed with this product. The sound quality is great
1,The phone cover was purchased with the need of having more grip for my not so nimble fingers. It works great. Shipment was prompt and no problems. It serves my need very well.
1,"This mini-sized car charger can go along way! Being so accustomed to see chargers that are quite large - when I opened the package I was quite surprised by its size. And quickly asked myself how can a charger so small in size have all the functions that a normal larger charger has?<br /><br /> The ALBK Car Charger is quite sleek and professional in its design and is extremely light in weight - enough to fit in your pocket without even noticing. At the same time, having two ports with this mini gadget is extremely helpful as often times my family and I would struggle with the charge on our phones whilst travelling long distances - due to the shortage of chargers. I occasionally tend to use my phone quite often so this charger comes extremely handy especially due to having the fastest charging speed of 2.4A. This charger can also charge quite a variety of products including (iPhone, iPad, iPod, Samsung, HTC,Nokia Smartphone,Sony,BlackBerry). Another added bonus is that this charger is extremely safe as it turns off automatically when the charge is complete.<br /><br />The question then arises? Why bother investing much into those huge chunky charges which take much of the room - when you get this charger which has speed, durability, compactness in size, safety, and convenience for a very affordable price! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,Good product
-1,Did not work.
1,My husband is very pleased with this Radio Wire Harness. It simplifies the wiring of his radio in his new truck and he is happy with the ease of doing so. Highly recommend for the beginner wiring process.
1,yes
1,This case is great! It fits perfectly and is super durable. I am a terrible klutz but this case is withstanding my life style with ease. Not too bulky either.
1,"I love it, just ordered a new one today."
1,Works perfectly
0,"I use this for a Galaxy Note Pro 12 and it does fit fine.  The only issue is that, once properly mounted and the tablet inserted, this thing wobbles around like nobody's business. It was very distracting at first and I contemplating returning it.  But then  figured on ways to minimize or eliminate the unwanted motion.  I situated the tablet mount next to the center console on my 2015 Toyota Tundra so that the tablet itself is wedged in between it and the A/C controls.  That did the trick.  Not sure if that would work on other vehicles, perhaps i was lucky. I didn't try the Galaxy Note 10, but I imagine the wobbliness would be the same. The issue is the bendable neck, while very very rigid and challenging to form, has lots of flex and with the tablet inserted the whole thing becomes very top heavy and rocks back and forth while driving -- it was too annoying.  I'm going to keep it though since it appears to be working out fine now with the &#34;fix&#34;.  If you situate this freestanding, it will wobble.  Another idea I had was to bolt the neck down with a curved metal strap against the center console side.  That would have worked too but it was unnecessary after I discovered the wedge trick.  Update:  I bought the i-Blason case for my Note 12.2 and this mount holds it with that case on no problem.  So no issues with side there!"
1,"Easy to put on the phone. Love the smooth texture that allows it to easily slide into my pocket, but allows no slipping from my hand.<br />So far a very protective case."
-1,Horrible quality do not buy. Armband feels like its going to rip when applied on arm. Does not stay put.
1,"As of today, this watch is compatible with the iPhone. Download Android Wear for IOS from the Apple App Store and pair! Enjoy!"
1,Great!
1,"This influence bank is justified regardless of the cash you spent. I utilize it to charge my iphone 5s and it effectively charges it 2.5 times before getting depleted out. The DUAL USB Feature helps me to charge two gadgets together. Sunlight based Charging Facility can be made utilization when emmergency, cool device."
1,Love wearing them around the house while I work or while I mow the yards!
1,"Case fits perfectly. Speaker ports were already cut out, and the perfect size. Its not as diesel as it looks, but its an ok case for the price. The holster clip is surprisingly strong as well"
1,"I like it because it has a perfect price, a good quality and IQ technology."
1,"Works great, would definitely recommend."
1,"This is the third Moto e 2nd generation I buy. First I got 2 two for my parents and now one for my sister in law, and it is amazing. For the price you get way more than what you expect. Even when it is a budget phone it has features that easily knock the competition, specially on performance."
1,"I really like all the features and hardware of this phone, battery life is good, camera is good (not the best but gets the job done) The only thing I don't like is the software, this phone is not very popular so phones like the M8 will have priority even though this phone is technically newer. I stayed at kit kat because of many users that complain about lollipop, Other than that, I really like this phone, I just wish it was a bit shorter and smaller for a 5.2 inch display phone"
0,"Honestly, I don't notice a difference in battery capacity / performance with the &#34;new&#34; battery vs. the one I've been using for over a year.  Wouldn't surprise me if these are actually used batteries."
1,Excellent
-1,Don't waste your money. It broke after few days of use. Not even a month.
-1,"It does not stick to my dash at all.  I was looking forward to this working great, but I put it in, and the next thing I know, my phone falls under my gas pedal.  Thank goodness I hadn't left my driveway yet."
1,"Nice, high-quality wire & molded connector design.  Very flexible (although I assumed it wouldn't be because of its appearance in pics).  Highly recommended"
0,"Cool. A little bit more cheaply made than I originally imagined, but cute nonetheless. Doesn't come with a wall plug, so you'll need to buy that separately."
-1,The capacity is no where near 20000 more like 10000 at best.  Fully charge it will recharge a note 4 three times and that's it.  But it seems to be a solid built and a looker.
0,Works as OTG HOST but will not accept charging if a usb is connected like a mouse or flash drive.
1,My three year old loves these! I tried them on myself. They are comfortable and work well.
0,"The card slots are able to only hold one card each, the faux leather tears pretty easily. Good starter to see if you like to carry around one article as opposed to wallet n phone.  I plan on buying a good quality one next,"
1,It is protective and unobtrusive. The buttons on the phone all work well. I like the material and translucent look.
1,Much more sturdy than I thought it would be! Fits perfectly!
1,Love it
-1,"Sent me the wrong size, so it didn't fit my phone at all. It was also very flimsy."
1,Excellent product and very good seller ...
1,"Fit: I've always had issues with in-ear headphones staying in my ears while I run.  I didn't want to buy anything too expensive, so these seemed perfect.  They do a decent job of staying in my ears while I'm running/sweating.<br /><br />Bluetooth Sound Quality/Range:  The Bluetooth range is pretty weak - no more than about 4 feet before I have connection issues.  Sound quality was a little better than I expected - but don't expect them to rival Bose/Beats/etc.<br /><br />On a side note, they do a great job of muffling the sound around you - so I would recommend being extra vigilant while you're running with these or leave one earbud out."
1,Nice and very fast delivery
1,Works perfect on my LG G Stylo.
0,"I have now had this forerunner unit for just under 2 years.  Overall it is a nice product.  The size is not overly large on smaller wrists and it provides the key functions that I needed for running (Pace, Heart rate, Distance).  I have found the GPS to be very good with the initial signal grab taking around 1 minute.  It is also a good looking watch (which is good for at least 20/sec per mile!).  The light is very bright and makes it very visible in low light conditions<br /><br />Now for the not as good.  (1) The alligator clips used to charge the unit are very finicky and have to be attached &#34;just so&#34; or it will not charge or synch.  The charging platform for the Forerunner 10 is much better and easier to connect (I also have a Forerunner 10). (2) The unit often freezes and needs to be rebooted.  This does not happen during runs but happens generally when you are trying to synch data or just charging (and then it will not charge which you find out right before you want to head out on a run.......) (3) The unit does not have an auto pause feature which would be handy running in a metro environment where streetlights are a constant stop/go driver.  I did contact Garmin regarding the units frequency of freezing and they halfheartedly gave me some things to try but seemed to indicate that was part of normal operation and instructed me on the reboot process..... (4) While this does have the ability to be used for riding, it is cumbersome at best.<br /><br />As I said, overall it is a nice product however I think the competition (including internal competition) has overtaken this unit.  The Forerunner 15 seems to be replacing this unit at a better price point and has all the same features.  I would look to that before purchasing this unit again."
1,Works great for my Galaxy S3 with slim case!  My phone never fails to charge (as it does sometimes when I plug a charging cord in)
1,"Great alternative to those who have an older model vehicle, works great when you find the right station. Thanks"
1,Love my case
1,It is a little heavy but fits nicely into a purse.
1,"Love my mophie juice pack, I work long hours and often use my battery pack.  I have dropped it several times and the case actually is quite protective as well !"
1,"SUPER CUTE! And now everyone I know wants one, lol. It works with just about every case. AND it does not fall out."
1,It's a clip. That works.<br /><br />As long as you make sure it fits your model Escort of course....
-1,I really like the feel of this case it's not very bulky but it feels substantial and high end.<br /><br />The wings are very unusual but cool. Until they broke and then the whole thing was extremely annoying. Its like the magnet wasn't strong enough to hold them to the case.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this case.<br /><br />Product provided for review purposes
1,"Like previous post points out that the LTE on ATT is not working properly due to ATT network can't handle MTU 1500 setting properly.<br /><br />Good news is that it has been resolved by ATT and StraightTalk recently and the Z289L shall work fine now on LTE. Nothing need to be done by user or the device. I have tested this device in couple places at ATL, MIA, DFW and LTE works terrific!"
1,Ordered as a gift.
0,"Came quickly, fit OK"
1,Awesome case multi useful
-1,"I have had this case for less then 5 months and both the plastic covering over the camera flash and the plastic covering over the main, circle button have torn. The clear plastic they put over those is very thin, almost like a Saran Wrap material, and not durable at all. This basically makes this case worthless when it comes to water protection and for the price I paid for it I expected at least a good year of use out of it."
1,great camera just try it
1,Fits my Galaxy S5 perfectly. Well made and easy to install. Openings for access ports are exactly right. It only takes a little more effort to open the charging port. Having the case on the phone makes it easier for me to hold it.
1,"I used it with my phone LG G4 and I didn't like it at all. It charged very very slow compare it with the original charger from LG.<br />-<br /><br />I changed my rating because of Aukey stuff, they contact me and help me, also offered a full refund.<br />They are really great even that the charger doesn't work well with my phone it works with Iphone.<br /><br />Thanks Aukey ❤."
1,Ok
1,"Easy to apply, very durable, and the cutout makes it so you can put a case on your phone without difficulties. I ended up ordering another set about 5 months later."
1,Really cute and fun design. Love it
-1,broke quickly
0,good
1,GOOD CONDITION
1,Was a gift. Daughter loves it. Just what I expected.
1,I actually ended up inserting it upside down in my CD player so it wouldn't interfere with other button functionality and it works great. I really like this.
-1,"Not accurate cable,did not fit Nook as described."
1,I've had this charger for around 7 months or so with no problems.
1,very satisfied
1,"Very pleased with these. I tend to break them, and lose them. So this price is great.  thank you"
1,"delivered on time, works as described.  Use it for Apple products...."
1,Works perfectly for its very limited purpose.
1,The transparent case shows off the beauty of the golden color of my iPhone 6 plus. It is also strong enough to be protective. Affordable price too.
1,It work out great.
1,"I have trouble with Bluetooth earpieces and never finding a comfortable fit.  I have always tried the on ear headphones or the ear buds.  This is my first in ear Bluetooth earpiece. I found this ear piece to be comfortable and easy to use, it doesn't bother me as much as I had expected it to.  It pairs really easily with my iPhone 6.  I just pressed the button on the Bluetooth in ear head piece for a few seconds, saw the flashing red and blue lights and I was able to see the device was detected by my phone.  Once I successfully paired it to my device, I haven't had to pair again since.<br /><br />I had to test it to see the sound and how well it worked, since some Bluetooth headsets give an echo.  This headset did not give me any echoes when using it.  You answer the call by simply pressing the button on the head piece.  I had no static with the device and has a crisp and clean sound when using it.  I experienced no issues with the headset and I was able to walk away from my phone for about 15 feet before starting to experience some slight static and interference with the headset.  I don't normally walk away from my device while using it, but its nice to have the option and knowing that the caller on the other end will still be able to hear me well and vice versa.<br /><br />This headset comes from chin,  so it is equipped with voice prompts in English as well as Chinese.  Since I don't speak Chinese, I do not use that feature and stick to the English language.  To switch languages, hold the button down and it will switch languages.  The device also has a pleasantly long battery life.  I have used it numerous times without needing to recharge.  I also don't use it very often which would account for the long battery life.  Overall, this headset performs as expected and is also undetectable with my hair down.  Its a well made ear piece that I got in nude.<br /><br />Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,Super Sturdy! Very Happy with this purchase and we ordered more just to have a change.!
1,I have been Using this product for a week.<br />--Installation is easy.<br />--Screen response is perfect.<br />--No Bubbles.<br />--Customer service is great.
1,Love it
1,"Paired easliy with my iphone, and ipad.  Just need to make sure you are not covering the lights on the button to let you know what you are doing.  Comfortable and secure in the ear, but I have not tried to run with them."
1,Really cool and handy but why have a wireless charger that is connected to a cord. I think the charger should have a built in battery so you can charge the charger and take it wherever
1,"Shipment received faster then I had anticipated ! Great product just as described, couldn't have asked for anything more."
1,"The new Droid 4 phone works fine. I did not receive a SIM card with this order, so I used the one on my old phone Droid 4."
1,Case is well made and fit perfectly
-1,WARNING....Does NOT fit a 5S... too small. Nice case but cannot use it and dumped it.
1,Very good.
1,Better than the last tempered glass screen protector that I bought. This one didn't even crack upon installation!
1,I love it
-1,"This is a great product. Or it would be. However, it claims to work with apple products but when I called tech support for connection issues with my macbook pro, they said it isn't actually made for apple products but for android, and they are working on updates for the iphone 6. Box clearly states it to be compatible with apple. They offered to take it back but we now know how to fiddle around with it to get it to connect with the macbook. So we just kept it as we like the product, and we keep manually reconnecting it. UPDATE- even with fiddling around, it doesn't consistently connect. We've been speaking on the computer phone on speaker, which is highly unprofessional and unpleasant."
1,"I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. This case is very easy to put together. Basically you remove the back of your phone, as well as the battery. You then pop in their uniquely shaped battery and then put place your battery on top of theirs. Next you use their case to cover the back and the frame of your phone. Overall its a super easy process and it actually work!<br /><br />Before using this product, I would have to charge my battery everyday (at night time). However, since using their battery, it has double, almost tripled my battery life. Now, I only have to charge my phone approximately every two days. The only thing I don't like about the case is the quality. It seems like this is the most popular complaint about the product. If they would just change the quality of the case, particularly the frame, this would be the perfect, most stylish product on the market.<br /><br />Because of the quality of the product, I only use it when I'm at home. If I go anywhere, I normally change it back to my standard case. However, my final thoughts on this is that its a great buy and it really does extend the battery life!"
1,love it
1,"Got this Saturday and charged an iPhone 5 and iPad Air. Charged fast! I was happy with how soon it arrived and how fast it charged. Next day, after an hour and a half, my iPad battery went up only fifty percent and was not being used while charging. This morning after charging my phone for two hours it added seventy percent and still not fully charged. Probably defective. Will update how helpful customer service is.  8/31 Just got off the phone with customer service and they will replace the defective cable. No hassles. Great customer service."
1,love it
1,This mount is awesome. Holds iPhone 6Plus. Really nice for using GPS apps. I highly recommend it.
1,Awesome!!!! Love it in my cobalt
-1,"I wore this tracker to my first water class today. After class misfit fell out of band, and will not recommend"
0,I'm a student and i take notes on my iPad and use the stylus to draw arrows and small pictures and the tips only last a couple days each. They gave me s full refund which was appreciated. The tips are hollow so they're just asking to rip through and scratch your screen with the solid metal base.
1,It's great--holds everything I need and protects my phone in a case that I can fit in my pocket.
-1,"Didn't really stick, I never sent it back like I should have."
1,I like that it fits me really well.
-1,"Ok first off I'm a long distance hiker and train during off trips up to 10+ miles a day after work. Now that being said I wanted a device that was accurate (this one isn't) and reliable with SUPPORT! Every time I plugged this unit in the software wanted to update the firmware. GREAT! Of course that's a good thing but after 3 disappointing chats no one could figure out how to get it to actually work. I used the forums tried everything could not get it done it kept giving me the same error. I then would connect to chat and no one would answer even 10 minutes after saying hello and reviewing my questions which were simple. (How do I update firmware, How do I reset Odometer) I had a few other questions but their manual is lacking SUBSTANCE and makes you fumble around. I needed something I could open the box and start using. I don't geocache so that feature is useless the camera is a joke Hello 2003 called they want their camera back (why is this even on a gps?). My biggest grip is with Magellan their support was RUDE and constantly cut the chats off even if the problem wasn't solved! Their phone support was just as bad again RUDE and inconsiderate. For $300 I expect top notch support this wasn't a whim purchase. But I guess I should thank them since I went to a similar Garmin Unit i'm quite happy with support and more features. STAY AWAY from this device."
1,Provides good protection and space to tuck in money or a credit card!
1,This screen protector has worked great on my phone. It was simple and easy to put on.
-1,Did NOT fit the phone that it said it would. Very disappointed!!
1,this has been a life saver when it comes to having to &#34;charge&#34; as we are driving from point A to point B. The G'kids are much happier when their electronics are working and I am less bored if my iPad or Kindle is charged. Plug this into your cigarette lighter and you are setup 4 usb ports and 3 DC outlets. These inverters have a tendency to get hot but this model has a great little fan that keeps the temperature down. The cord is ample length but if the cord was slightly longer it would be PERFECT. [of course perfect length depends greatly on where the cigarette lighter plug in is located] I would buy again [it would be great to have one in every vehicle] AND I would recommend to a friend without hesitation.
-1,Not good doesn't charge phone.
1,"Case looks good and provides good protection, and the stand feature works well. It could be improved by adding a hole or slot to the front flap so that the camera would work even with the front cover folded around the back. One weakness of this design is that it does not allow for car dash mounting. I found a workaround, but incorporating some means of doing this would be a great improvement as well. My case was shipped to the wrong location (an error on the part of USPS, apparently), but one irate phone call to Amazon customer service later, the error was rectified, and I got the case, albeit a couple of days late."
-1,"It worked for two weeks then it would not ring when a call came in.  Tried adjusting settings it did nothing to help then in the third week the 1,2,3 keys all stopped working.  This rendered the phone useless."
1,"This phone doesn't come with much in way of setting it up, and it is so old of a model and so basic that it took me a bit to get things done.  There is also a section on the website that answers  some common things such as speed dial, being able to disable the lock button on side of phone.  I have tested it and sound is good/clear.  At time of purchase, my father needed something as simple as this to, we hoped, communicate by phone now and then.  Within days of receiving it, unfortunately his cognitive ability slipped further and he is not able to use the product.  Of course this is of no fault of seller and I will donate it."
1,Quality product
-1,"Worked great when I first put it on a back in late July.  Now, it fits loosely and I expect wouldn't keep the water out if I dared to test it."
-1,it was great at first but it only lasted a few months.I should have expected this from the price.
1,I just love it for going places. Everything you need is all together 😊
1,Charges battery really fast and easy to carry
1,"Charged up very quickly.  Haven't needed to use it yet, but ordered it especially for whenever power goes out as it can during our rainy season here in Florida.  I thought that Erika would hit us, but it didn't, thank goodness."
-1,This is not a protective case by any means. It is indeed slim & the corners snap flush with the phone. The sides (leather grip) does not extend around the phone. The plastic material feels flimsy & I don't feel assured that if the phone were to drop that the case would stand up to the impact.
1,It looks amazing
1,Absolutely love this screen protector
1,Despite some reviewers concerns that this case was difficult to install I had no problems.  It isn't as bulky as more expensive competitors but provides a similar type of protection.  For the price this case/protector can't be beat.
1,I bought them in every color. They are great and look just like the apple band. Would love other colors too!!!
1,Works as stated.
-1,Doesn't fit my phone very well.
1,"Bought for my kid - works great, but not sure what the plastic back is supposed to do...it barely stuck to the back of the phone..."
1,Terrific!
-1,"Had it sitting on a bed two days after I got it. Come back in a couple of house later, to find it sitting on the floor, and te little cover that opens and closes by the charger a lot at the bottom of the phone, was broken off. Now a month later, have not dropped it at all since that day, and the sidings are starting to come off.<br />Do not get this case. It is not worth the money."
1,Easy and fast to connect to my iphone 6. On my phone it tells me how much battery is left on the headphones which is a nice feature. Two gripes are that the batter does only last about 6-8 hours depending on how much you use the buttons on it - and there is no carrying pouch/case to protect them. Great for running or at the gym with no wires. Would recommend to buy.
1,"All the tools given with the product is helpful if you use them carefully.<br /><br />I used a hair drier and it didn't work enough to loosen the glue and i broke the lcd underneath. :(.  I'd suggest to spend some more bucks for heat air gun. The string broke since glue was hard.  They gave a spare string and that's nice.<br /><br />In short,  Good product and clear instructions."
1,This product does it's job well. It charges my extra battery quickly with no issues.
1,Great case fits perfectly on the phone.
1,"Used this on a trip to Mexico.  We even took it on our way swimming in the ocean to the hidden beach in Puerto Vallarta.  It did not get wet.  While we tried to hold the phone out of the water as much as we could, it still was submerged for long periods of time.  I highly suggest this cheap but effective case.  It isn't pretty, but it works.  To sample it, I filled the case with toilet paper and then closed it and submerged it i my sink for some time.  When the TP was not wet, I know it was safe to put my iphone 6 in it and take it to the ocean!"
1,Great durable case!
1,I like this phone it is more that I was expecting .Amazing image resolution.
1,"This is the second one I have received due to the first one falling apart just a week or so after receiving. Im hoping this one holds up a little longer. The replacement policy was great however, and a replacemenr was shipped in just 2 days."
1,Great Bluetooth headset with professional processes and shipping. Very easy to connect to Bluetooth and the sound quality is great. I love using them when doing yard work around the house and when exercising. I did receive a discount and recommend these speakers to anyone that loves music has much has me.
1,Fast delivery and looks great!
1,"Great case, protects BB Classic and not too large."
1,I love this case
1,Great purchase :-)
1,Its a great product.  I already own several.  I purchased this one because I wanted a lighter weight one to carry on a daily basis.  Its not much lighter then the bigger ones I own.  Not enough to make a difference.
1,great one i like it
-1,Broke after 1 use.
1,"This mount is sturdy, adaptable & well-made; my Samsung Galaxy S5 fits perfectly.  Very pleased with this purchase."
1,"Works fine, good price, very happy."
1,"Good original batteries, and worked as expected!"
1,Looks great!
1,"These are really cool! I use them on all my devices that have cameras - computer, ipad, phones, etc"
1,Love the leather - it smell like wonderful leather
0,Super cute. Fits in my back pocket perfect though the material is PVC tends to crack easy. But love the design
1,"The texting is really annoying, however it is a great little phone for basic needs. I killed my my more costly smart phone, and find that not paying data and just using the basic features is really all I need."
-1,Kills the battery super faster. with the blue tooth. even when it's in airplane mode.
1,Works great for my Note 4
1,"I spend a huge amount of my time listening to music when I am working out, cleaning the house, or working in the yard. I own a ton of different headsets, but I honestly think this is one thing that you can never have too many of.<br /><br />These are a really pretty bright green color that I love, especially since this shade of green just happens to be my favorite color. The cords are very vibrant and eye catching, so I love wearing these when I'm going for a jog in the evening if it is going to be getting dark while I am out.<br />The earbuds are comfortable to wear and stay in place while I am moving around.<br /><br />As far as sound quality, I have to say they are pretty good in my opinion. I'm not a person that is super picky, but there are great for my needs.  I found I can turn the volume up pretty high and there is a minimal amount of distortion. Keep in mind you do have to adjust the volume from the phone or MP3 player, there is no way to do this directly from the headset.  I received a pair to review, and enjoyed them. While I do prefer Bluetooth headsets overall, these are a really nice pair of corded earbuds. Good sound quality, fun bright colors, and enough volume to drown out the world. Thumbs up from me."
1,Arrived on time.  As expected.  Thank you.
1,"Awesome band for the price and excellent customer service. To me, it honestly feels like the same quality as the iPhone bands. Will probably buy a couple more in various colors. Good stuff."
1,A great product. I've dropped my phone hundreds of times with this case and it's still pristine. Plus their warranty service is amazing.
1,Power add makes the best products!  This is the third portable charger I have gotten from them and this one much like the others charges my Galaxy quickly. I am a Poweradd customer for life!
1,Case was exactly as described. Great Seller.
1,Great charging base. Works well and is easy to sit phone on and charge. Some other bases are much more finicky about getting the phone in the exact position before they start charging. This one is easy.
1,This works great. No one can  look over your shoulder and see what you're doing!
0,It's really good product!
1,"Love this case! Fast shipping with prime, the case fits perfectly and is tough enough for my lifestyle."
-1,"Often indispensable, but occasionally flat out WRONG. Also, when I start it up it sometimes goes back to the previous search without being asked. (I would not get it again.)"
1,"These are great for my fitbit charge, and arrived amazingly fast!"
1,great
1,Slim case looks good kickstand works great.
1,Yes. Thank you.
1,Get product! Fast shipment and good quality!
1,Good Product.
1,"Yeah, I know - it's just a cable, but Love, Love, Love! - where's the Love Button!? The Heavy Duty cable doesn't really crimp up or tangle so it's less likely to bend and break the wires inside - less likely for the cat to eat through it, too. Snug fit on connections on both ends. And with a six-foot cord, I don't accidentally yank it out of the wall when reaching to turn off the alarm in the morning. Without question - I'd buy another! Highly recommended :) If this review helps - gimme a 'Like' - I like to know if I'm getting through to you. Thanks!"
-1,"I have owned a Boostcase before and loved it until the case broke, I reordered the new one and it worked fine for about 2 weeks until it started to fry my batteries. I could charge batteries without Boostcase on,but the minute I put on Boostcase it would kill the battery. So not only out of the cost of the new Boostcase but the two new Samsung batteries I just bought. So not happy at all with the purchase at all seriously DEFECTIVE!!<br />HOPE TO HEAR FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SEE IF THEY BACK THERE PRODUCT - WILL LET YOU KNOW........"
1,"This is a great power bank! Two USB outlets, charged it up once in the month ive had it, used it 3 times to full charge my phone and it still has 50% battery life left! You can turn it off while not using it to conserve power!"
1,"Water proof test worked. Case fit my phone perfectly. All features still function without difficulty (fingerprint ID, touch screen)."
1,Good quality
-1,"Way to expensive for what it is and does. Scuffed soon as I put it on, huge white mark across the whole thing. Waste of money"
1,"I purchased this for my wife's Galaxy Note 4. She wanted it to fit well (not too tight or too loose), and provide some protection from minor drops. The most important attribute that she was looking for was for the case to not add too much bulk to the phone. It's perfect, and the buttons are responsive with the case on. Well worth the few bucks. I was so impressed with it, that now I purchased the Galaxy Note 5 version for my phone."
1,"A life saver on our vacation.  With phones and cameras and all, it would have been a logistical nightmare .. .or we'd have had to take multiple chargers.  I might even consider one with four ports for the next trip.  The only downside was that my wife does not like the blue light on when she sleeps.  I threw a shirt over it and ... problem solved ;-)"
1,"This is a great thing to have around!  I keep this cable in my car.  I can charge my iPhone, my husband's Galaxy, our kids' iPads, our hot spot, friend's phones, etc.  with one cable.  When I use some cables, I get a message on my iPhone that the accessory cannot be supported.  That has not happened with this cable.<br /><br />I was able to purchase this product at a discounted rate, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,"Liked this unit due to the flexibility of media types it can play.  I'm sure you can find a better option, but it will likely not be in this price range.  The only negative for me so far is the display and the difficulty of seeing it in bright sunlight.  This said, I'm not sure I read a review of any competitors that someone didn't have this same complaint.  Sufficient power to satisfy most though it struggles a little to compete with engine noise, still not bad overall. Haven't used the Blue tooth yet so can't speak to that features functionality.  Look at the price and features and I think you can't really go wrong here at this price point."
1,Best selfie stick
1,Perfect choice for my desk at the office
-1,I bought 3 and only 2 was working.
1,"Case was ok, not as protective as I was would like, but was not bad otherwise."
1,"[[VIDEOID:b1307f68c35bdad477763bb69225e146]] The TechMatte Power Pod 2 Qi wireless charger is a great \\""disc style\\"" Qi charger.  It is a little larger than other ones I have tested.  (This is a good this as it makes laying your phone down on it easier).  The charger comes with a standard USB to Micro USB cable that you can plug into any USB port on your computer or laptop.  They do not include a wall adapter with this, but I have several and used one of my own with no issues.  Nice user guide is provided all though not really needed because it is basically plug in and use.  I tested this unit with a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (with a Qi receiver installed), and had no problems with the Note 4 detecting the pad and charging (it does take a few seconds to detect the pad).  The build quality is nice, it is all plastic but I found no seams out of place and is put together nicely. Over all this is a great charger for TechMatte at a good price and I give it a thumbs up.  I was provided a unit at a reduced cost for my honest and unbiased review, I was not compensated to give a positive review my thoughts on the product are my own.<br /><br />Luke @ Galaxy Tech Review"
1,Excellent
1,This product is very handy when it comes to charging. The company makes sure that if there are any issues with the product in which they produce they try and fix it right away.
1,These cases are awesome...
1,A good quality as a $35 glass screen protector I purchases at Verizon.
1,Just what I wanted!
1,I really like this case for my iphone 6 plus. It was received when stated. It is very convenient and stylish.
1,Great product but mine got broke and I  need info to get it fixed ty
1,Grandson loves it!
1,"Spend the money; don't use the cheap wireless receivers; mine didn't work; but once I attached this case all is good.  This back cover does make the phone slightly bigger and it will not fit the Otter Box Commuter Series case, but it does fit the Otter Box Preserver Series case & my Lockproof case; plus it allows you charge with the case on."
1,These work great protecting my Apple Watch.  Love the variety in color and the screen protector that was included is great!
1,My son loves this case.  Shipping was very fast.
1,I really love this flip case - so easy to use and remove.  Safety and secure.  All in one slim case.
1,we love it
-1,It could probably be because I do not understand how to use it and the instructions were in another language.  It did not light up as it said in the shorter English version so I don't know if it charged right and it failed to charge my phone one time and one time it only worked a short time. Could I have a tip on what I am doing wrong? Plugged it into our phone charger and waited days for a green light that  never appeared.
1,Nice!
1,"These work well, but one had a defective battery compartment latch. I am using a rubber band to keep it closed."
1,"Good price for a good quality case. It took a few weeks to arrive, but otherwise no complaints"
1,dosent come with stand
0,It's almost perfect but I wish they would make a genuine leather so it won't chip off.
1,I really love the case. When through our 1st fall a day after my case arrived and I can tell you now is I didn't have this case n screen protector I would be looking for another phone right now!!!!
1,Love it.  Fits my s5 perfectly along with putting other things inside of it.  Very versatile and I loved wearing it.
1,"BIG LESSON: I live in Hawaii and I already got my iPhone 6+ wet (without no protection) when I went off to Samoa for work. Always have some sort of water proof casing for ANY phone or precious belonging you own !<br /><br />Now that I am back in Hawaii and living exactly in front of the beach and it being hurricane season, it was definitely a MUST HAVE to buy some sort of waterproof casing for my new iPhone 6+ (since it got water damage in my other phone). I was not willing to spend over $70 for a Life Proof case. I have heard many bad reviews about that case from my roommates and friends that have that case and I ended up finding this one instead. For a BIG fraction of the price, I can definitely say that is 100% better than having a life proof case. (I bought mine for 9.99).<br />After I received this case, I followed the instructions that were sent in my email about testing it out. I left a napkin in the case overnight in a bowl of water. The following morning, I took out the napkin and it was completely dry inside!<br />So I went to the beach that same day and put my new phone in the case and into the water. I swam out in the ocean, did a bit of snorkeling with the phone and the case and by 1.5 hour of being in the ocean, my phone still ended up completely dry. This case doesn't block the camera in the different directions you put it in and it still takes nice quality pictures. I tried talking on the phone and using the finger sensor on my iPhone, but it wasn't really that great. But if you are ever going to be a body of water<br />Quality wise, it is very durable and easy to wipe clean. I absolutely love this product and I would definitely repurchase this again. If you are contemplating on buying this or something else, I would highly recommend this product!"
1,Great price so I ordered 2. We tried them and they're both fully functional with no problems. Nicely made and look identical to our Apple cables at a much lower price.
1,Perfect for Mumford and Sons Fan
-1,"The suction did not stay attached to my dash board, so the unit was always falling down, especially when my phone was in the holder."
0,It fits but the hooks slip off and blocks back camera
-1,"Eh. Find a better case, it gets dirty wayyy too fast and it's hard to clean."
1,"Works just as advertized and charges faster than I anticipated, considering they are supposed to perform that duty at 60-70% of direct charging (probably my imagination).  Very nice low-slung profile that fits my Galaxy S6 almost perfectly.  Had it about a week, and no problems so far."
1,Got this at a discounted price for an honest review. This glass really helps I've ordered it 2 times if it wouldn't have been bc of this glass I would've had a cracked phone. Amazing!
1,Works as expected.
1,Received quickly and they are just what I needed!
1,Appears to be a guality product at an affordable price.
1,"Have had it for a couple weeks. works very well so far, although it doesn't seem to charge much faster than the original chargers. i will be doing some traveling in the upcoming months then I will know if it proves its value."
1,The antenna fit my SR5 Toyota pickup 1994.  Thank you.
1,Love my otterbox commuter series case!!!!
-1,"It does what it's suppose to, but needs to be replaced in no time because all the little jewel thingy's fall off easily."
-1,"I find this thick and bulky.  I like the silicon or jelly covers much, much better.  It also falls off.  keep looking."
1,Worked great.  Looks like a new phone.
-1,They do not work with our phones as soon as you plug them in you get an error notice on the phone or they charge for a few minutes and then the error appears. Spend the extra money and but the apple product or they will not work properly.
1,"Another excellent product from Anker. Works great, very well made."
1,"Great product, charges faster, lasts much longer than original battery."
1,"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:<br /><br />This is by far the smallest headset I've ever tried and it works quite well.  Range is decent, sound is good on both ends of calls, and the ability to plug in the other ear is great.<br /><br />It came with a plethora of ear pieces of different sizes and styles and several ear hooks if you don't like using just the ear piece (I found it works best with the swivel hook).<br /><br />The call quality is good (almost on par with my Bose in-ear headset), but the stereo is a little lackluster.  It isn't bad per se, just a little tinny and lacks punch.  I wasn't really expecting more though from such small headphones.<br /><br />I think the ability to convert them to stereo is what really sets them apart.  If you're looking for a single ear BT headset you can quickly convert to stereo for music and videos this is a great solution."
1,The LG Ultimate 2 LG L41C is an exceptionally great smart phone at the Amazon price (under $70.) and works very well with Tracfone.  I was able to transfer my previous phone number from my old Tracfone over to the new one along with all my minutes and activation time.  I would highly recommend this smart phone and Tracfone to any economy minded person who is wishing to avoid the high costs of long term contracts with major carriers.
1,"An easy to use mount.  Fits the handlebars well.  The safety cord that plugs into the earphone jack is a nice touch and has saved the phone from several plummets.  However, the ratcheting clip seems to be good for only half a year or so of near-daily riding before it starts to lose its grip on the phone."
1,Works great on my iPad that my kids use everytime I put it down. I feel it is protected.
1,"works great , and price was a great deal"
1,Has only been a month and a half and product is not working. Very disappointed especially when you're expecting a quality purchase.  UPDATE:  Update. As soon as I left my review I was contacted by Anker. They were very helpful and I received a new iPhone 6 cord to replace the defected one. Customer serve is great and they truly fixed this issue in a hurry
1,The case fit my iPhone 5S perfectly. I have no complaints about the product. So cool.
0,It ok only to charging to 80%
1,"My kids think this is magic.<br /><br />I have been using my Moto X 2014 and had a good experience so far with our first selfie stick. When my sample arrived to review, I was a bit skeptical but it works well and holds the phone firmly in place. Given I am not a pack horse, even though I am a mom with a purse, I really needed something light and compact and this fits the bill and most of my bags. Our selfie stick has held up well, even being handled less than gingerly at times by two little boys."
1,I got this for my auntie. She love it. She think she all that now.
-1,"It was a good idea, but I was never able keep the screen protector on. Brushing up against something would remove it."
-1,"It was comfortable to wear, but one of the tabs that secure the phone broke off after three days."
1,"Works so far. The solar charge as others have said would take forever. The cords that came with it are pretty junky but a usb charger cable is pretty inexpensive. I'm happy with it so far. My only complaint is how insanely bright  the indicator LEDs are. We had a power outage and I was able to see to get around the house just with those. Charging it at night, I had to put something over them for the blinking to not keep me up. I was able to charge my phone at least twice."
1,perfect fit for replacing my old motorized factory antenna in the old 94 accord.
1,"This worked very well in Serbia, Croatia, and Italy"
-1,These speakers are HORRIBLE. They are also pictured with a plastic horn but that does not come with them.
1,Exactly what I wanted!
-1,Save your money this cord worked maybe 10 times. The wire splits and is garbage!! And of coarse you can't return it because it a week past the 1 month warranty. Save your money!!!!
0,No privacy
1,"This has been a great &#34;first radio&#34; for my 7, 5, and 3 year olds.  It holds as many songs as you will want to load... what I mean by that is that the MP3 songs are ordered and displayed numerically only.  There are no song or artist titles, just a number from 1 to x.  The volume from the built-in speaker is more than adequate for in the house or in the car.  We have found the battery life has been good too (we've had it for 6 months or so).<br /><br />We've used it on trips to let the kids take turns as DJ.  Even the 3 year old can manipulate the songs and volume without trouble.  Going down the highway in a minivan, it still sounds good even from the far back row.  We got it to let the kids learn to use an MP3 player, but searched far for one with a built-in speaker so that they were not damaging their hearing with headphones.  This is a really good product for the money, with the only drawback being that you cannot see song titles."
0,"its ok ,,but makes your fone freeze ,,if you don't belive buy it ,,I didn't think it would but I learned when it froze the first time ,,,is it worth it ? yea I guess ,I got cpl batteries now I never have my fone on charger just swiching batteries but takes a day to charge a battery on this charger"
1,Great product strong and we'll bulit
-1,"Didn't work for me.  The instructions didn't have enough pictures for me as someone who has never done this before. I used a heat gun and thought I was doing it right, easy, but there was some sort of screen behind the glass that popped off with the glass.  That thing cracked and split like crazy when I tried to use the wire to separate it.  I assume that secondary screen was important since there was some sort of important-looking tab connecting it to the phone that disintegrated as I tried to remove the glass.  Ended up having to trash the phone.  There might be better instructions on YouTube or something, but I wouldn't suggest relying on the included instructions or really trying to DIY at all if you don't know what you're doing."
1,"just like an otterbox, without paying $$$ for it. Dropped phone plenty of times, didn't break or damage the case."
1,It fits a need in great ways. It is sturdy and durable and should last for many years. Thank you for this product...
1,Excelente producto
0,"If this was a little smaller it would be great but it fatigues my ear and I have to fiddle with it every so often.  I don't use it for phone calls so I can't speak to the call quality because I only use if for listening to YouTube, Netflix, etc.  I really do like it, just wish it was smaller or had a different size available.  If it could be made of a flexible material and not a hard plastic that would be nice too."
1,excellent
1,"buttons work fine, sound is great with it."
-1,"Let me start off my stating my credentials:<br /><br />I.T. UNIX Administrator<br />Electrical Engineer<br />Music/Sound aficionado<br /><br />This is a 2000w rated Subwoofer with absolutely no RMS ratings, even from the manufacturer. I am pushing 350-400w *TRUE* RMS from a Kicker CX400.1 amplifier.<br /><br />Within 3 Hours at low levels during the break-in period, poof, giant cloud of smoke from the back of my SUV. With my amperage and current monitors I calculate roughly 122w RMS being sent to the speaker.<br /><br />Now, I was able to resolve this issue by removing the epoxy cover over the wire connecting the terminals across the speaker spider, and replacing them with movable copper coil wiring. Due to a MAJOR design flaw, the wires between the terminals and the voice coils are surrounded in heat shrink, giving it the single greatest point of failure that ever speaker manufacturer recognized in the 80's. However, after fixing these flaws the subwoofer has been performing optimally for 12 Hours now without another failure. I should have to fix ann obviously defective speaker just to have one work, but this leads me to my next gripe.<br /><br />Amazon Customer Service: You Suck<br /><br />I've made every effort to be fair in attempting an RMA and then canceling it, so as to prevent you from eating return shipping and refund costs, yet now I am being forward to your Claims Department for an overall review? Seriously? I have been providing Customer Service for over 10 Years and never have I gotten away with such poor treatment to any individual, be it a customer or a random person on the street.<br /><br />This will be my last purchase from Amazon, and while I recognize I am only a single individual, I sincerely hope this starts a trend amongst all Amazon Customers who recognize that being treated like garbage does not fly with your paying Customers.<br /><br />Thanks for the headache, hassle, and a fantastic experience."
1,Easy! As the title says this was the easiest protector I have ever put on. The instructions are pictures with text and very easy to understand which is a plus always. It gives you everything you need with an extra sticker to get those little bits that float on right before you apply. I like the tabs they give you so as to allow you to line up the protector and then stick them on and tab over the phone so you can fold the screen protector over and it stays lined up.  When I put this on I cleaned the screen with the supplied alcohol swab and then dried it with the supplied dry cloth I then removed the tab that protects the protector then stuck it on. Because of there process the thing just basically adhered it self to the phone. I bought two and the first one I didn't clean properly so there was one air bubble but with a little wiping it came out. It is very thick as compared to others I have tried and feels just like the phone screen instead of a cover. I really like it because of the way and that it goes on so easy. The fact that it is totally clear and feels just like the phone is perfect. I can't find anything wrong with this thing at all. The fact it is so cheap is another plus. Being that I just put it on I can't comment on durability but I think it will be fine because it is glass. I think I applied to both our phones in less then ten minutes and that was mostly cleaning time. Awesome!
1,Great product!
1,Love it.
-1,"The picture is a thin film that peels easily, the case itself however is strong all around."
-1,"I have a case but no phone. New phone would not work. Had to pay postage up front to get the phojne taken back..So, now I may be stuck with a case.. My son needed the phone but now I am not knowing about another phone by mail??? What if this happens again."
0,Unfortunately this product did not provide much range which made it useless as a desk phone headset.
1,"Great case. After spending over $20 for a crappy Spigen case, This is much better and looks cool too. I will buy another one for myself"
1,I replaced my non-working $20 back-up camera with this Pyle one. Installation was easy because the wires were already in place. Decent picture quality. Nice in daylight or pitch black night time. The only thing I noticed is it &quot;reacts slowly&quot;. My old one I had my Edge CTS monitor set for 2 seconds delay. This camera I had to set it for .5 seconds and it actually takes about 2-3 seconds to turn on. No worries. Seems to be much better quality than the last one I had. Hope it lasts!!
1,Nice product very good and prompt delivery will buy from 5his seller any time
1,"Still adjusting to fitting of ear buds, much better results with changing out to a smaller set of ear buds that were included. Clarity of music is much better than with my previous ear phones"
1,"Very good, it is perfectly design to protect the lcd display."
0,"Its a lovely case and really adds to my phone, however I think it makes my phone run hot. According to the other reviews here, it appears as if the case blocks signal and such, which could be making my phone work harder...hence it running hot. I've never had any of my iPhone's to run so often until I put the case on. I've had it for a few months and noticed my phone running hotter and loosing charge super often. I'm taking it off to see if anything changes. If it does, I'll come back and update. However, if it doesn't then this is another potential buyers may want to take into consideration prior to purchasing.  I have the case in rose gold, which is really pretty. Disassembly was a little hard, but once I got the hang of it I was able to pop it off easily. The case will scratch, but mines hasn't scratched too badly considering the daily wear and tear. Not a fan of the &#34;Soybeans&#34; branding on the back cover, could totally do without it!"
1,"Works right,  charges every time for me. The materials and workmanship is crap. The rubbber/foam that contacts the phone doesn't hold up.<br />One day,  just driving along my phone & charger just drops to the floorboards,  scaring the crap out of me. One of the joints came unglued. Yeah,  they just used a dot of Superglue to keep some pieces together.<br />I fixed it with some hardware so it's stronger than when I first received it,  but that's not the point. I shouldn't have to within two months of receiving.<br /><br />Tl;Dr great deal if you have the talent/skill to fix what falls apart.  I would buy again."
1,"The S6 as we know is a gorgeous device. I wish that I did not need a case for it...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Slim<br />- Gives clearance if laying screen flat on a surface<br />- Nice texture on the back, allows for better grip<br />- Buttons / ports are not compromised<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Don't expect Otterbox protection<br />- The rubber material can pick up fingerprints easily<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Provides good protection but it's meant more for aesthetics. For what it is, it's great...buy it."
-1,Terrible period.
1,"Very sturdy case, I got this for my son because he is always dropping his phone and of course it breaks but I have a feeling he wont break it again with this rugged case!! It fits his phone perfectly too."
-1,"Not enough protection, would not recommend"
-1,"It looks nice, but does not charge when my cell is on."
1,What a great sportband for a great price.  Would recommend to others
-1,Day one: Package had a different name brand on it? oh well. looked the same sp I kept them as they seemed to be good quality...Next day I used them at the gym and I noticed it was skipping songs. tried using to make a call and kept disconnecting. Sent back. No thank you
1,"Receiver sensitivity not that great.  Audio output has a little hum to it.  Programming is a bit counter intuitive.  But, what can you expect for 28 bucks?  Going to stick it in my go bag for emergencies."
-1,"Worked well while it lasted on my iPhone 6s, but the rubber &#34;fingers&#34; that wedge into the vents broke off after a couple weeks. Disappointing."
1,"Awesome cables, great price"
-1,Opening is weird and it's hard to turn on
1,Works just fine.
1,Grandson had no problems fixing his phone
-1,This only works if you have a signal somewhere for it to capture and send somewhere where you do not have a signal.  If you do not have a good signal at your home anywhere... don't bother it wont help.  Amazon only gives you 30 days to figure this out before they won't allow you to return it.
-1,"I connected the device as instructed and then found out the website had updated instructions that were the reverse of what was included in the packaging. I tried to contact the manufacturer both by email and phone for additional support and received no response after a week of waiting. That said, I don't know the quality of the product but I'm not a fan of the manufacturer based on the experience."
1,This is the BEST phone case I've ever had.  I should have gotten one in every color.
1,Worked perfectly!
1,Good product...meets my requirement
0,works great in my mother in laws Dodge.  But will not work on my 2013 Ford F150 Truck at all.  Good construction and holds the phone well.  If you have round air vents it will not work.  Has to be the rectangle with the square style grid.
1,"Out of the two different tempered glass screen protectors I have bought, this has to be the best quality that I have used. I am the type of person that drops my phone often and the screen itself has protected my phone. The screen protector itself really feels like a glass, not some knock off kind of glass. It has definitely cracked since I had it, but I can say that it is of GOOD quality. I would recommend this out of the other temper glass that I am testing out as well. Id definitely would repurchase this again"
1,Great headphones work really well.
1,Excellent
0,Side protection doesn't work. I had to remove them but front and back are ok
1,Good
1,I love it
1,Works better than i thought it would!
1,As advertised
0,"Only one size of ear buds which are uncomfortably large. Wouldn't recommend, there are way better choices. On the positive side the battery life is good."
1,"This case fits my galaxy s6 perfectly and it is slim and sleek looking, I love it.  My favorite case by far, the best part is that it fits into my armband for my daily runs without having to take it on and off.  Love the fact that I can get the protection I want for my phone without a big bulky ugly case.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
-1,This product did not work it was a waist of my money
1,"Fits phone perfectly.  Two piece set which can be intermixed with other colors of same product.  Bright colors, stones stay on back of case very well.  Great case"
-1,"I hardly ever respond to invitations to rate a product  but this one I had to. The first  week I accidentally dropped it and the cover broke off.Could not reattach it.Then I noticed that it does not charge sufficiently at all.i.e,it might charge maybe 50 % from a 30% deficit and that's being generous. It would have made more sense if it had been designed to charge both devices at same time. In short this was a waste of money. DO NOT BUY!"
-1,"I really wanted to like this phone, I have several other ASUS products and they have been flawless, but this phone is not one of those products. Problems I've had with this phone: randomly reboots itself at least once a day, apps are constantly freezing forcing me to hold down the power button to restart the phone, when returning to the home screen from any app it takes at least 15-20 seconds before the home screen loads, when the apps aren't just freezing completely up they run really slowly, and there is A LOT of ASUS included bloadware pre-installed on this phone. Overall I'd say save the money and get a Samsung or LG phone as I've used both brands and had no issues with either."
1,Works!!
1,I received the 4th car charger today and it is the same one as the 3rd and does not work. I will now ask for a refund and try getting the nuvi 200 car charger from another dealer.  Very disappointed in this item.
1,"The Stallion iPhone 5 case is everything I expected. I like that I can plug in the headphones without removing the phone from the case/belt clip. Case is very durable and protects my phone very well.  I know this because I've already dropped my phone by mistake several times, and not a scratch!"
-1,"It was not what I thought it would be .  Did not fit the phone, waste of money"
-1,"Bought it on Prime Day. It worked great the first couple of weeks but then all of a sudden it quit working. I charged it via the wall socket and also tried charging it through my computer, both times the green light indicator was full but as soon as I took it off charge it died."
1,Great product  for the price
1,Cool design durable
-1,"Poor performance, I replaced my battery because I had to replace my broken screen so I figured I would do the battery while I was in the phone and rejuvenate it, but no... This battery doesn't last as long as my almost 3 year old battery did. Luckily I saved my old one and intend to swap it back out when I get the chance. Don't bother buying this..."
1,Exceeded expectations. Charges just as well as my fast adaptive home charger. Great product!
1,"My charger is not working, I was wondering how I could exchange it?"
1,this case is absolutely perfect
1,Very pleased with my purchase!  Item is exactly as described. Much better car charger than what the cell phone companies try to sell you when you purchase your phone.
1,It's good
1,"I found the case for the most part to be a great buy! The only issue I had was it fid fog upbsome being in a hot humidg climate. I did not submerge for long periods under water, I still felt nervous doing so. I did a test before hand however with paper towel in case under water for a longer period and it remained completely dry. All in all I was very pleased with this product and had several people ask me about it."
1,Works great! So glad I replaced my old one.
1,this was exactly what i was looking for to upload my music to my computer and you can also use it as a walkman like the old days
1,"little bit of work to replace, but cheaper than a new phone, especially when the only reason I needed it in the first place was due to a bent pin inside the USB."
1,Annex products never disappoint - best case on the market !  Lucky I got it apparently annex disc. this model on their site already had the 5 retired & 6 case needed this one for a work issued 5c.
-1,Was not what I expected.  Thought it was a glass protector with hard shell. Did not like it at all.
1,"This car mount is great to use. It is a little heavier and bulkier than I like, but over all great quality and works wonderful. I would recommend this product to anyone. It is a nice feeling as well and doesn't scratch your stuff."
1,Best screen chield I have ever had.  Easy to apply and remove if needed.
-1,"Trust the reviews from the previous customers who have purchased this case and rated a low score: it doesn't fit the buttons on the phone. Both sides of the case seemed to be loose as oppose to a snug fit that we all should expect. In turns, the buttons are extremely hard to press because you sacrificed their tactility by putting on the case. However, as one of the only few companies who actually makes a case for the Galaxy S6 Active, you're very limited to the choices. Well, this phone is called &#34;Active&#34; for a reason so I'll just go without a case from now on.<br /><br />On the pictures, please examine the side edges carefully before you consider purchasing this case. As you can see on either side of the phone, the case is lifted."
1,"Great product. Looks great, feels great in your hand and very sturdy. screen is clear and still sensitive to touch. well done."
1,Comfortable fit. Easy to set up and use with my phone. Great price.
1,Fits perfectly and comes off pretty easy. I love the Speck cases but hard to take off. My only issue is the there isn't much of a bump or cushion to protect the screen from getting damaged if it lands face down. Other than that it's a great case.
1,"Great and excellent product, protect excellent the iPhone Screen."
1,Great Product
1,"Good case, took forever to get it delivered but great for the iPhone 5c because it allows you to see the color on the back of the phone. Does not interfere with use of the phone. Great buy for the price if you have the patience to wait for it."
1,"Not really one to write a review but I am one to read a review. Being that this is a great product I had to go on record and let everyone know. I've had  many headphones on my ears or in my ears so my 5 star rating is for sound quality,engineering and definitely price."
1,Very useful and easy to use. Puts the phone where it should be and easily adjustable
1,This is the highest quality screen I've ever gotten. Works and looks great and doesn't feel cheap like other screens I've purchased in the past. Well worth the price.
-1,These suck... don't buy them. Mine stopped working within a week... waste of money
-1,poor quality
-1,The product was not as advertised.  It does't file the standard outlet for an American Vehicle
1,"Not completely anti bubble but I would say mostly. Easy to install, and it fits great."
1,"Totally worth it!! Exactly like the description has lasted me a really long time even went to the beach and sand scratched it but I can still see crystal clear. Makes screen Very sensitive accidentally deleted apps on my main screen while in pocket. Also includes screen cleaner and stickers to help you place it on your phone, recently dropped it hard and screen protector cracked but only about an 1in in length in center and did not break actual screen, can still use my phone perfectly! Will buy again and again!"
-1,This is going right back!  This product is of poor quality and looks and feels like plastic with a cloudy appearance.  I am sceptical that this is an actual BLUBOON-Tempered due to the fact that NO WHERE on the package is the name &#34;Bluboon&#34;. Just says Made In China.  Really peeved about this purchase.  Dont appreciate being cheated and mislead.
1,I love the color of this case. I love that it's protective but not bulky. I love the feel of the case.
0,"It chargers really fast on Samsung phones but for Samsung tablets, I didn't see a huge difference between the original charger and this. I thought the length of the cords would make a difference so I interchanged them and put them side by side to see the charging speed and it didn't matter. It just didn't charge fast enough."
1,"After doing much research we have found this product to be the best product value and fast shipping was even better, thank you..Want to stand out buy one of these fun bunny phone covers. I love this cover so much..."
0,"Very good for the technology of today. I only gave 3 stars because it's not very usable, the tech. needs to mature."
1,Fits great! Love the color!
1,"I love it, great fit and lightweight"
0,The wallet is OK.  It would not be my 1st choice again.  The magnet is on the wrong side so it stays open but not closed. The kickstand was not in the package and even after claiming it I never received one.
-1,Poor quality and dont stay or fit in my ears.
1,works very very well !! love it !
1,great buy
-1,speaker is tinny
1,it's a good buy! enjoyed using it.
1,Came in handy while moving. I shouldn't have worn my moto 360 but I got the warranty so I wasn't too worried. Saved the screen multiple times.  Glad it came with 3 cause dust got under the first one and the second one got scratched real bad on a wall while moving the couch.
0,charges to slow
1,Nice just to bulky
-1,I verified that it is the model advertised but it did not fit the phone.
-1,No good I can't use it! Makes me sound muffled when I am talking!
0,It's ok
1,Does the job and charged really fast
1,I absolutely love this phone. The user interface the sleek design the battery life all is exceeded my expectations.
1,Kept our iPhones safe and dry kayaking and in the pool. Worked as intended during a sea kayaking trip. We spend a lot of time in and or around water this has been extremely useful. I also use it as a yard supervisor as I don't wear a watch and never have pockets so I can tell the time.
1,Awesome! Very happy with it.
1,"I ordered one of these and the sliding door was impossible to open. I messaged the company to explain the problem, and they sent me a new one free of charge! The second case works perfectly--does exactly what it's intended to do!"
1,love this case! not bulky but with good coverage. great design. loved the color!
0,"have to take protective cover off to insert, very tight fit anyway"
1,I am happy with this product so far.  Easy to pair easy to use.  Sound quality is good and the fit is comfortable for my ears.  I wish they had it available for left ear as I have some hearing loss in right ear but that would be my only issue.
1,Awesome
0,"Interesting Proof-of-Concept, but does not track through screen protectors."
1,great product! i get many complements on it
-1,"In my 2003 BMW Z4, this product didn't work as expected. It plugged in and fit just fine to the back of the factory radio, but no AUX functionality. After cutting it apart, I noticed that it is missing the 1x 300kOhm resistor and 2x 0.022uF capacitors. If you wire the capacitors in series with the L and R wires, and the resistor in parallel in between, then your factory radio will work to recognize the AUX input.<br /><br />Overall, 2 stars because it didn't work out of the box and required a lot of modification to work properly. Price was cheap though."
1,So far so good. I have a Surface Pro which requires the AC adapter port and have had the opportunity to test the device out. Very happy so far.
1,Works really well and did not slip on my shower wall at all like my previous one I bought for 10 dollars more. I really like this product! My showers are extremely better without having to worry about getting my phone water damage.
1,I like it.
1,I luv it 👍
-1,"This item arrived on time and the color is exactly what I wanted.  However, the hard OtterBox outter case won't completely snap shut.  Took it to my local Verizon store where an employee took one look at it and said that he was &#34;almost sure&#34; that it's a knock-off.  Evidently, the product's serial number doesn't match any serial number made for a 4S iphone.  He was able to get the case on well enough so that the soft cover is about 3/4 on; but this case will not provide much protection.  This is the first time I've ever been displeased with an Amazon product.  I bought what , I thought, was an OtterBox (that's how the product is advertised); and instead, I seem to received a fraudulent item.  Very disappointed."
1,"Fits my go pro good, but the nut stripped first time i tried screwing it on, luckily i have a giant surplus of gopro supply's so i stole a nut off one of the other mounts which didn't fit snugly in so i glued it, the material looks sturdy enough, looks and feels just like my gopro brand hat mount."
1,"Quick delivery,very nice cables/good build 👍😃"
1,Good product
1,As described and fast shipping.  Satisfied customer.
1,Had this case for over two months and I still love it.  Enough space for up to three credit cards in each slot.  Stylus is easy to access for me.
1,Excellent Thank You..
-1,Damaged upon arrival!
1,"Let me just say for starters, thank the gods for the rubber &#34;grip&#34; on the back of this case! I accidentally left my phone on the top of my car and it stayed on for a good half a mile ride (with turns).<br />All in all its a great case! It's slim, looks great, can take a hit (or drop), and what I really like is that it has a wider opening at the charge port to accommodate non Apple brand chargers."
1,I purchased 2 of these mounts for both of my road bikes and frankly I am VERY pleased with them. I used to have a quad lock previously and I feel this is even sturdier and love that it angles up for using the camera as well. During a local century several riders asked about the mount and seemed to really have lots of positive things to say about it.
1,I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents for this coming year. My daughter bought me one last year. Mine is a 15000mAh RavPower and I love mine so I wanted to get my daughters one too. I keep mine in my purse and if my cell phone needs charging I don't have to figure out where I'm going to charge it if I'm out shopping. They are also strong enough to charge a tablet as well. It is kind of heavy but so worth having around.
-1,I relieved my case in two days with prime membership.  The clear case looked great when I first put it OK now my new Galaxy S6 Edge+ and it fits just perfectly like a glove.  Unfortunately it is not scratch resistant.  The very first day of usage I saw scratches on it and it was in my purse pocket with nothing else in it.  My phone does not look as glamorous as it should with these scratches on the crystal clear cover.
0,No vibration at the reception of a call
1,These are the best out there. Could have been a bit more longer but then it might have been harder to hold it. Anyways quality product
-1,Phone has to be at least two feet with in it to work
1,"Although this is fairly outdated now due to the new lightning connector, this is a sturdy little device you can get a quick, one time charge out of in a pinch. Is fairly slow to recharge, but aside from that, nice device."
1,Plastic is a lot more flimsy than I thought it would be but the case was too cute to pass up.
-1,"I was looking forward to this stylish phone purse. Unfortunately, it's one of the cheapest products I've received from Amazon. The wristlet is useless. The strap is attached to the hook instead of the ring, and there's no way to connect it to the purse. One of the hooks on the long strap does not close until it's forced. I doubt it will last long."
1,Great product. Relatively easy to install and does look like glass.
1,I had issues with my first case and was able to troubleshoot very well with the company. After we couldn't find a solution they resent me product for free and now I have a case that is awesome and I love it. So not only is the product great but the customer service was amazing. Thanks :)
-1,"I purchased these headphones March 20th 2015 off of Groupon & boy am I still dreading do so. I always have my Apple EarPods so I purchased these for gym use. Now I just don't use them at all! They slow up the process on my iPhone. Every click while typing, every music note, every noise period is caused with delay with the phone and headphones are paired. The sound quality is horrible. When trying to watch a movie or video while the headphones are paired, the headphones are trying to catch up to the video...it's like watching a Chinese movie w/o subtitles. It's a headache. One good thing I can say about this product is that the battery lasts for quite some time. Otherwise than that DO NOT PURCHASE!"
1,old phone for this technology (2015)...but still a cool phone. reminds me of the blackberry.
-1,installed battery and worked great for a few weeks but now wont hold a charge. not worth the hassle of return shipping charges. should have listened to previous reviews
0,looked neat but some of the pressed flowers stuck thru the plastic
-1,Nt i expected hate it
1,"[[VIDEOID:2341f14120dc21efbefe97676ba89d64]] Watch video here in HD on YouTube: http://youtu.be/7mK6GAnr80Q<br /><br />A great case to keep your iPhone 5s looking sexy and minimalistic. I usually have my phone naked except when I travel, I usually have a Mophie battery case when I do. This simulates a naked like feel when handling it however during my review I did find something that did not suit well. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Ultra thin case<br />-Comes with a stylist<br />-Comes with a screen protector (basic level)<br />-Very durable<br />-Flexible<br /> -Transparent however multiple colors are available<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Cutouts are not precise, at least on the review unit I received<br />-Volume buttons are hard to press<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Overall this case is not bad, I really love how thin and durable it is. Just because I had issues with the volume buttons this lost a star. I also really like how it came with a screen protector and a stylist, especially considering how affordable this case is.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am a professional product reviewer and was provided this unit in exchange for my honest opinion."
1,These are the best earbuds on the market.  Best quality.
1,I love it great case.
-1,"buy 2 , one would run a few weeks the wifi and then stopped when I wanted to make a claim had already spent time replacement"
-1,"Do you like trying to piece together broken English? Do you enjoy the rage the comes with putting together a selfie stick with no instructions? Than look no further than the Urpower selfie stick!<br /><br />First of all, the English was heinous. I've traveled to 15 countries and I've never been more confused than I was trying to put this together.<br /><br />The instructions also must be focused on some older or newer model than my phone, because it instructs you to open the camera and click on the gear icon. Welp, the gear icon doesn't exist. So that was a delight.<br /><br />I guarantee that I was putting it together incorrectly, but my phone was very flimsy and loose in the selfie stick. I'm taking this bad boy on a road trip with me and am going to be holding it over the cliffs of Acadia in Maine? Probably not.<br /><br />I will return, 100%. I would not recommend this product unless you're some sort of engineer, speak broken English fluently, or have enough wine to give you some clarity on how to set this up."
0,It was nice initially but the diamond fell off pretty quickly. I couldn't find the lose piece so I couldn't glue it back together. I wish they stay on a bit longer.
1,"I love this case . It fits perfectly the new Moto G 3 . It looks elegant , i got the black one , nice smooth  leather , no smell , magnet closes fine . It doesn't have sleep/wake function , but I don't like that function because it interferes in the on/off of the phone itself  . Good protection , the leather borders are a little bigger than the rubber case inside in a way that if phone falls it will hit the leather corner first. It has space for cards , but i don't use either not to add volum , plus , i don't want to use a phone as a wallet . Perfect case . I will use it until it lasts ."
-1,"Seriously, do not buy this. The battery is worse than the one I was trying to replace. Waste of money."
1,"Protects phone very well, looks great!"
1,fair
1,I am very happy with my purchase.
1,Works

1,"I've only used it a couple of days, but so far so good. Long cord, fast charging, as long as it holds up, I'm happy with this product."
1,Great case - I love it!
1,"Very cute, bigger then I expected but so cute on my phone."
1,Samsung Galaxy S5 fits well!
1,Product was exactly as described!
1,My stepson needed a covering to protect his mp3 player and he found this. It works great and priced good.
1,I am on my second Linear Bluetooth Neck Loop. I used my first Linear neck loop for over a year before it quit. I find the bluetooth version much easier to use and much less of a hassle than wired neck loops. I strongly recommend it.
1,Thanks
1,These work great in my Galaxy Avant.
0,"The packaging was the OEM box in a envelope. After waiting 2hrs taking out stereo and trouble shooting the camera was defective. Here is advice, dot. Waist time wiring till you test first. The camera chasie was really high quality, the size was fine for a 05 Corolla."
1,Love the case.  It fits perfect to my iPhone. Their customer service is great and super fast to respond any questions and inquiries.  I actually ordered the 6 instead of the 6 plus and they did not hesitate in helping me out!
1,it was good
-1,did not used it and returned because flimsy
1,Fits like a glove around my phone and it feels secure.
-1,"I have updated my review for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.  The foam pads were impossible to re-apply, and the side pieces don't create enough grip to hold an iPhone 6s plus.<br /><br />2.  The bottom feet do not stay in place, and as they're the primary load-bearer, it's no longer a good unit for me to have.  I got my year's worth out of it, and if you're okay with buying a new one every year, that's cool.<br /><br />##### Original review follows #####<br /><br />I'm very happy with the unit so far. I previously used a dash-mount unit from MPOW, and I was very happy with it until an Alabama summer made short work of the glue holding the foam pads in place. This unit uses the same design, which is why this gets just four stars. I'm ready to use a stronger adhesive when the time comes.<br /><br />For value, this mount is hard to beat! Having the phone much closer is very, very nice."
1,Great Watch for the Price. I'm ready to Upgrade to a Samsung or a Motorolla for more features and Smooth operation but works good for the price.
-1,Doesn't fit the phone properly
1,Fast.
1,"This is an absolutely stunning case. The colors are incredibly vibrant and look painted on the back of this case. The silicone makes it easy to put on your phone and it's a soft case so no hard edges jabbing at you if you are like me and tend to put your phone in your back pocket. I like that it is a thinner case so it's not to bulky and it's easier to hold for someone like me with smaller hands. This case is definitely a great deal at less than $10. This is one of those cases that you will be so pleased with, you may never want to change it.<br /><br />I received this free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
1,"My wife and I both bought IPhone 6's and we wanted slim cases. If you're looking for moderate protection with little bulk, this affordable case is a great option. It's sleek and has nice styling; plastic on the side and back and durable rubber on the top, bottom and corners.<br /><br />My wife purchased a comparable otter box symmetry and I like this better.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price<br />Durable<br />Stylish<br />No loss of key use<br /><br />Cons:<br />2 piece design (plastic shell snaps over rubber)<br />Would like better grip on sides"
-1,O.k. for the price. However it completely fell apart after six months of use. I'm not sure if its demise had something to do with the fact that my wife tends to stuff too many things into a wallet.
1,"Love this cord and the company.  When my cord suddenly stopped working, I contacted the seller and they were very helpful and promptly replaced the cord with a new one.<br /><br />I have not had a problem with the new cord."
1,Great!
1,"Nice, and easy installation. I have been using this for almost a month directly connected to my car's fuse box a permanent charging solution for my iPhone. Has been working great so far!"
1,Great item
1,great
1,"5 stars all day long!! Dropped it as soon as I put it on my phone, nothing, perfect! All the buttons and switches work and my signal is BETTER with the case on then off. Best investment I have ever made in a case, any brand, any material. Thank you for making such a awesome case. The only issue I have is sometimes it's hard to touch with the thick glass but I adapted to it."
1,Does the job the bass knob works. I am driving one sub so just buy an amp that's overrated for your sub and you'll be good
1,Best idea I had to up my iPhone photography game. Love how the wide screen expands the view of the camera and how this allows for all lenses to work with both the front and back camera. Great quality.
1,Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
0,experience problems with the device connecting to my device...
0,Dose this watch work with the moto G 3
1,Good
1,My wife loves this case and it makes her feel safe using her phone. She loves how it feels in her hands too.
1,The charger surpasses the manufacturers claims of power and ease of use it works for all of my Samsung Galaxy  products plus my Toshiba Satellite laptop. I would recommend this product and brand to anyone looking for the extra security of a backup power source for my mobile devices.
1,"Easy to apply, saved screen."
-1,Malfunctioned after 2 uses
0,Looks nice but closure is really too tight if you have cards or anything in the slots.
1,as described
1,"Pros:I love that I can put two cards in the case and don't need to carry a wallet. The curve shape of the case makes it easier to carry my phone around. Easy access to ports and pronounced power and volume buttons. The back snaps on/off easily and securely. Great price.<br />Cons: The case is a little bulkier than most cases. The shiny back of the case shows every fingerprint smudge. The front edge of the case is flush with the phone, so I can't face it down. There is a longer ledge around the camera opening that may impede the effectiveness of the flash."
1,"Bought this for my husband, who always had tangled ears cords. Now.. not so much ( as he only, puts one ear piece in his ear. The other one is tangled, but wrapped up and away). Happy with this simple solution to tangled cords."
-1,Are u guys serious about this ?<br />I just got it today and as soon as I opened it i got so mad
1,This case is not only stylish but very functional. It keeps my phone protected from scratched snd I find the magnet to be bery secure.
1,Magical lights and stuff!
1,It works well
1,"My spouse has one of these and really likes it, so I thought I'd try it.  It has a good grip and I don't have to use a case to carry my phone in."
1,"It worked great  until it fell off the windshield and the glass shattered.  Suction cup worked well for a few months. then it started falling off constantly. then one time it fell and did not survive. touchscreen is now non-functional.  Update: I called Garmin CS (800-800-1020, got thru right away).  Got several good suggestions for the suction cup.  clean glass and suction cup with rubbing alcohol (not windex) and micro fiber cloth. wet cup before applying to glass.  or try the portable friction mount.  And then, even though my warranty is expired, they offered to repair it for free (replace with refurbished unit).  I am very happy.   Performance wise, the Garmin is the best. So I am happy to stay with the brand,  I bought the friction mount on amazon an it stays on the dash solid as a rock."
1,Very neat case. fits perfectly.
0,Super cute. Fits in my back pocket perfect though the material is PVC tends to crack easy. But love the design
1,Pretty good for the money.

1,I reviewed it in great time and it fits perfect!!! Thank you!!!
-1,The case is cheap very cheap
1,"I am a mom, always on the go. It is sad to say, but before this, I had never owned a car charger and always wanted to get one. I was happy when I got to try this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.<br />After getting my package, which I must say came very fast. I opened it up and didn’t need any directions because it is super easy to use.<br />I would recommend this product for everyone, but if you are someone always on the go and need to charge your devices. This would really save you in an emergency and everyone should always have one on them.<br /><br />Pro’s<br />Easy to use<br />Great price<br />Great quality<br />Fits most cell phones and other devices<br />Cool colors"
1,"Love it, period!"
1,Wonderful! Really protects this small gem.
1,It was great! My teenager loved it !
1,Love it!
1,works awesome
1,"Excellent product.  Attached easily, fit perfectly, works better than the phone surface itself.  Excellent addition to a great phone (Samsung S4)."
-1,Does not work with the PIXI 7 unless you cut a little notch out for the power button. Also other than the first little bump the bumps to hold the tablet up are useless.
1,"My boyfriend bought me this case and I love it (despite the blah look)! Charges up/is recognized faster on a Qi wireless charger than my boyfriend's LG G3 (with a Qi receiver attached to the back of his phone).<br /><br />A big big BIG CON is how it renders the audio port inaccessible. &#34;*** This wireless receiver phone case is designed to be used with original Apple iPhone only&#34; Yeah. I get that, but the OEM Apple headphones are Pieces of S. -.-<br /><br />Great charging phone none the less."
0,"This phone case is super cute, although expensive. I've dropped my phone twice with this case and both times the case has popped off after falling. Nothing has happened to my phone, so it does protect it, it just pops off after. I've had a couple of stones fall out, which is expected, but that's been before the fall."
1,great gift for my daughter
-1,"Said it would fit my phone, but my phone was too big to fit in it. Disappointed."
1,This case is slim and sleek while still giving my phone the protection that I need. It took a little concentration to apply but I am VERY happy with my purchase and will be buying this brand again.
1,d
0,the case looks gorgeous - however the case if slightly bowed across its width making the case fit poorly.  For the price I would have expected a perfect case.  I contacted the company via their website and have heard nothing.
0,"Case is adorable, although quite bulky as I'm sure you can imagine from the picture of the item. Several of the stones fell off in the 3 month time-span I used this case for, but I was expecting just as much."
-1,"As others have said, this is not space gray.  It is shiny steel black and does not at all match the space gray apple watch.  It might match the stainless steel in space black.  But that is a different color and this was not advertised as space black.<br /><br />If you go through the trouble developing a product you should probably know the color.<br /><br />Additionally, it did not slide into and out of the watch smoothly and was a bit loose.  it also uses harder to find 24 mm bands.  I tried 5 or 6 22mm bands at a local jewelry store and they were all too loose.<br /><br />Just not good enough to keep.  I returned this item."
1,This case fits perfect and offers great protection.
-1,the power wire is ok for running some weak subs  RCA cables are cool  but the speaker wire is s*** and is a pain in the but to work with  so this kit gets 2 stars
1,EXCELENTE
1,Just as described.
1,nice
1,"I started using the Super Bass of my friend and I loved, I had to buy mine. It is heard with good power and has good range. Thank you"
1,It's great
1,"Bought this for our 14 year old daughter and she loves it. It was easy to sync with her iPhone 5s. Daughter likes it because there is no remote, the shutter button is on the handle so no remotes to lose. Selfies are being taken all the time now."
1,I am a fitness instructor and I use this to hold the transmitter for my mic.  I holds it well and I can move it around me as I change exercises.
1,Cant complain about this amazing product. Forget about invisi-shield and ghost armor. this product is affordable and reliable. just got the whole family a set of these!
1,"excellent cable, it even has a proper strain relief."
1,With 4.8a this charger does its job!
1,The battery was as described and much cheaper than any I could find locally.  I charged it up and put it in my phone and it has worked ever since.  Good price and fast shipping.
1,I have been searching for a protector for my new samsung galexy note 3 I am getting on the 1st and this one looks great read over other reviews and believe I've made a decision :)
1,"WOW. I didn't realize an armband would actually fit my iPhone 6 plus. So I ordered this one to try it out. It is perfect. It fits my 13 inch arms (Hey, I'm a thick girl) great with a little room left over on the velcro band. The reflective strip around the screen is great. I love when companies think ahead on safety, as some armbands do not have that.<br />I am able to access the bottom port for my ear buds with no issue. The phone fits snug into the band, but I have to remove it from its case first. This is pretty much a given. However, my kid can use it with his iPhone 6 still in the case and it fits without any issue. The screen does not hinder the touch screen ability at all.<br />But I am unable to use the armband. I love my iPhone 6 plus, but it's too big for me to carry on my arm. It interferes with the ability to move my elbow because of the size. But, that's okay since again, my kid can use it with his  iphone 6.<br />I received a sample armband to test and use in exchange for my unbiased review."
1,My father in law loves it! Thank you! A+++++++!!!!!
-1,The product was not too bad but considering it was the wrong one for my phone so there
1,Nice
-1,This item came to me dirty and used and only sometimes works... that is when it feels like working.
-1,"The cover looks used. There are so many scratches on the back of the cover. I am attaching the picture of it to let people know that the product is not the way its being advertised!!!<br />Total waste of my time and money,"
1,"Got this screen protector so in case he drops his phone it is protected. Love the screen, easy to put on."
1,These phone sleeves are so cool. They really work to protect our phones. We wear them in the gulf to take photos!
1,It's a wiring harness. Geez
-1,Not sure why this is on my review page. I never have ordered this. I own only Apple products
1,great case a little thicker but really tuff
0,"Beware...the colors of the actual cases do not match what is shown. The colors are much more muted and drab than what is pictured. It is functional for protecting a phone, however."
1,like it
1,Great case if you drop your phone a lot
-1,"It is very cute, but does not stay on. It actually dropped out of the case and the screen cracked as a result."
1,"I use this on my patio and also indoors. It's a great, easy to operate bluetooth speaker."
1,Good
1,Great case... Does anyone know how to attach the neck strap to the case?
1,haven't used it in water but my note 4 fits inside and I like the arm band and the lanyard
1,Great Seller and Great Product!!!
-1,Didn't fit my phone but seller was very accomodating.
1,Great product. Thanks.
1,It's fit perfectly.
1,"This case is awesome.  I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it.  But I love this case.  I closes with Allen head screws, has an almost glass type cover and is so heavy duty it is a wonderfully well made and durable case, made to last and take a beating."
-1,The fit is horrible - no matter what adapter used the fit is just sloppy. When working it has great quality
1,This product appliEd without a problem and looks great
1,"I looked at lots of screen protectors before finally deciding to take a chance on this one.  I'm glad I did.  The quality is great, you can't tell that you have anything over the screen as far as clarity goes.  I didn't have any problems installing it either.  I wiped the screen with alcohol, and then used a micro fiber to wipe it again.  The glass went on very easy.  So far I haven't had any problems with the edges lifting and I've had it about 3 weeks."
1,Great price easy to use.  Purchased for a tracking system.
1,"Looks great on my Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge Plus, light weight matces the color of the phone great and does not take away from the beauty of the phone."
1,great one i like it
1,Great product
1,Not a bad product for the price. Would have been great if they had a swell too.
1,"Good headset for the price, but have had a couple of issues. It was initially easy to pair with my iPhone but have had the pairing fail several times for no apparent reason. I am just using it for my phone, primarily while driving, and had to switch to speakerphone when it happened in order to take the incoming call. Very distracting, so I had to pull over. The other issue is I find it painful to have on my ear after a while. My ear is on the small side, so that could be contributing to the problem. My old Headset sat on the outside of my ear and didn't have to be inserted into the ear like this one, so it was very comfortable. It cost twice as much, however, and broke right after the warranty expired, so I replaced it with this one. I am hoping that I will find a more comfortable way to wear it."
0,f
1,love it
1,"Great product, I have bought 3 for all vehicles. I have an iPhone 6plus & it holds it great."
1,"I use it when I run, it occasionally skips audio but moving my phone to my right side alleviated the issue. The battery doesn't last more than a couple of hours before needing a charge."
-1,"The case provides excellent shock protection for the enclosed phone. But it's nearly impossible to reopen the case without breaking off the latches in order to access the SIM. While prying to reopen the case, the phone was in danger of being scratched which defeats the whole purpose of using the protective case."
1,Great gift
1,so far works great and feels sturdy too.
-1,"Woow what a bad product! The word cheap describes this in every way.when i receive the headphones they had been broken off and were hanging by the wire. The bright side is that they work but not the best quality. Its mostly a rare case but how could i revecive my heaphone like they had being use for a couple months and then shipped off for some random person to used it next. I wasnt expecting alot, i mean they did cost less than 30 dollars but still not a this quality."
1,Durable and sharp looking!
1,", the case fits the phone very nicely. It is comfortable to hold."
1,I've only had the case a few months and it broke. But other than that it was a good case. I would prob buy another one.
1,Functional and cheap
1,This is so cute and adorable case:)I got the Cat design and i just absolutely loved it.<br />The case is strong enough to protect phone.Easy to access the buttons and port.<br />Easy to put phone and remove.If you are an animal lovers this case is just really amazing and you will definely love it.<br />Recommended.<br />Im so happy to test this product in exchanged of my honest feedback.
1,great product and customer service!! will buy from again
1,Very good quality.  Better then the original.
1,"very good case, it works wonderfully."
1,I got a single 15 2 ohm in a 1997 s10 that I go to compitions with and with a 1500 watt amp I do right around 140 db so really loud and as long as you alow it to break in for a good time before you turn it up then the sub will last for a long time
1,Great product.
1,"If you have one accessory outlet and a spouse, you need this. I used to get frustrated and angry when my wife and I both wanted to charge our phones on a road trip. The driver needs navigation running and the passenger wants to get some screen in, but both of us want our phones charged when we get it if the car. Thanks to this dual-usb charger, it's a non-issue!<br /><br />I got the black one. And it's the best looking one by far, IMO. The 2.1 amp charger charges quite fast, but the 1 amp charger is good enough to allow use with some battery charging. The whole thing stays fairly hidden from sight which is just how it should be.<br /><br />I received a discount in exchange for my honest review."
1,A gift for my niece...she loved it!
1,Thinnest case I've ever had! Literally impossibly thin!!!! Great job! Just make it a little more durable with adding as little bulk as possible.
1,"Great sound, solid Bluetooth pairing. Battery life is good and recharge is fast. My biggest issue is remembering which buttons do what, but that's my memory, not a design flaw!"
-1,It fits very well but the back doesn't look very appealing it looks like there's water behind the case. But when it comes to protection it does the job.
1,"There is just nothing wrong with this phone case. I bought it because of the cute colors available. I wasn't even gonna try Otterbox because it's known for being bulky but this one I guess is the least bulky of all their cases. Even though it's thin, it still gives you the feel that it's durable and that it's gonna protect your phone from breaking in case you drop it accidentally. Would totally recommend this product."
1,Arrived on time and as described
-1,Terrible - won't hold a charge.  Refurbished nightmare  -  if we hadn't been in such a bind I never would have bought this
1,Works as expected
1,Pretty much does what it's supposed to do. The only downside is the light stays on... always.
0,First of all it came a day late but it's ok no big deal but I loved it the privacy thing actually works! But the thing is that you have to look at it straight at your phone if you move it a little to the side it makes this weird thing that messes with your eyes and it gives me a head ache and the other this is that the screen is so thick that it's hard to touch the screen because sometimes you have to tap hard or it just won't feel the tap and it gets irritated but other than that it's an ok item for $5
1,The fit is perfect. Completely satisfied.
1,"I have been really happy with this so far.  Great deal.  Good sound quality, comfortable, easy to set up.  Most earphones pop out of my ears that that has happened a few times while working out here, but i'm getting the feel of how to twist them into my ears."
-1,"It looks so cute, but unfortunately started falling apart within two weeks."
1,"First of all, this (Gray/Orange) ASHIELD protective cover fits my LG Ultimate 2 perfectly and I can manipulate the controls with no problems.  The orange cover is soft and almost squishy.  The gray part is hard plastic.  This means I can maintain a good grip while holding my phone and although I feel confident the cover would protect it well from a drop, I cannot attest that it is &#34;Amy&#34;-Grade, LOL.  I don't use the holster, but it seems substantial and the belt clip can be turned for vertical or horizontal carry.  The holes line up and the cover does not negatively impact the mic, speaker, camera, or controls.  The USB port does have a flap that can be a little persnickety to open when you want to connect the cable. But, it probably most definitely helps keep dust and moisture out.  So it's a positive.  The picture accurately reflects the color and I've gotten lots of positive comments on how it looks.  More importantly, I can now spot my phone easily when I lay it down amongst my other junk or the cat lays on it.  I feel like I got my money's worth and I'd buy it again."
-1,Poor quality.
1,its kind of hard to get the phone out its real tight
1,"The charger is Good, but the receiber is too hot when i charge my Phone"
0,Great product. I would recommend this.
1,"To date this has been a good cell phone choice for my wife who favors screen size over portability. The phone is perfect for her, too large to strap onto my arm for a run."
1,Ordered for my son to use with his iphone in his Honda Accord. He likes it and hasn't experienced  any problems
1,I can't recommend this product highly enough! A problem with the Note 4 is that it uses way too much battery power so you have to have a charger within reach. This product ends all your battery worries while simultaneously taking care of your need for a protective case.
-1,Not official samsung headphones. Sound quality is horrible compared to the headphones that came with the phone. $9 is not worth the hassle of returning the headphones.
-1,"Opened the package, made sure the phone fit, went to put clip over belt and the entire clip came right off.  The clip is supposed to be connected by a single rivet.  The rivet (which was never closed to hold the clip) fell off and I found it on the floor."
-1,"Terrible, cannot hold charge.  After a full night of charging, my phone was at the same charge (no apps running, on wifi).  Do not recommend at all, look at the Encased USB wall charger instead."
1,so far the product has been great with zero problems. so nice having so many ports! another great product from Noot!
1,great one i like it
0,"I got this product so that the Robotic Sphere would not be so noisy on my hardwood floors when my dog is chasing it. What I didn't anticipate was that when my dog catches it, she is able to puncture the soft rubber. So it is great on not being noisy--just not too durable."
-1,Hi. I liked. The. Case. But when. I. Answer. My. Plonk. I  have. To. Hold. The. Case back why.
1,"Very nice looking case, i dident want a case for my alpha cause its a really pretty phone as it is, but this case compliments it very well, looks nice and definitely looks like it will protect it from a good drop, though the way it was packaged(in a soft package) it got a little damaged, dident break the plastic but theres a bend in it, not returning it cause i dont want my phone to go unprotected for a week...  Update: owned it for a good few weeks now, still like it but had to deduct a star cause the gold color is peeling off around the edges, looks a bit ugly now, its not peeling on the back... yet."
1,These worked perfect in my phone. So happy not to have had to buy a new phone.
1,"An excellent case at a very reasonable price.  My daughter opted for the light pink and really likes it.  It seems sturdy yet lightweight and the edge comes over the screen enough that I'm hopeful it will protect the glass if the phone is dropped.  So far, so good. Highly recommended!"
1,Great
-1,not able to use
1,Great case!
-1,I recently got this adapter and like a lot of people mentioned it does skip several beats multiple times while playing the song.
-1,"The sidewall is a bit fragile. The phone slid off the bed, about 2.5 feet and the side near the volume buttons broke off."
1,"Very easy to swap after watching a quick youtube video. Definitely worth it. My old port cover had broken long ago, and I didn't realize a replacement could be done so easily without taking it to a store. Probably took about 5 minutes total, including watching the video and messing with a screw that didn't want to budge."
1,Great item and fast shipping
1,"QUALITY: tested and it works DELIVERY: slow boat from China (expected): PRICE: low - minimal risk.<br />If you kept floppy discs and want to transfer to other media this unit has done the job. Looks like it will have limited life but if I get through my floppies, I will never need it (nor the floppies) again. Owning costs less than third party conversion for half a dozen floppies.<br />BARGAIN"
-1,Wouln't work with charge
1,Had for a couple days and so far so good!
1,Just got it in the mail today. I purchased the green/gray for my note 5. Not as vivid as the green looks online. The case is light. Feels durable. Fits the phone well. Buttons function well. No issues with the touchscreen. Not real comfortable with the access ports to the charger and aux cord input. They are a bit tough to move back...as in the little flap pushes against the charger and the aux cord. Not an issue for now. But will come back to update how well it holds up after everyday charging and a lot of aux cord/headphone use.
0,"Just got it, seems ok trying it out right now let you know later.  thanks & Aloha"
-1,After 2 days the minions started to fade in appearance. I guess the heat from my fingers and from the phone in general caused this to happen. This case needs to be made of different material. It was nice for 1 day.
-1,"It worked for a little bit but then the little claps all started breaking off. And the little circle that shows the Apple symbol started cracking and it drove me crazy, so now I use a different case."
-1,Didn't work at all for intended purpose.
1,"I was using a 2-slot one of these that plugged directly into the wall. Annoying since I have an iPhone, Fitbit and Garmin Fitness Bands. So constantly leaning over to unplug/plug in something. Received one of these and wow! It's very heavy, quality made and comes with a CORD so no leaning over to use it! Works awesome! I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone-, who has just ONE or two items to plug in at a time?!"
-1,"Sound quality is great...as long as you move slowly or your phone is on a flat surface. If you have your phone (I have an iPhone 5) in your pocket or in a holster clipped on your pants or in a purse and walk briskly or run, the sound breaks up. This is the second Bluetooth headset I've tried that has the same problem and the other pair was from a different manufacturer."
-1,This was not what I was looking for.  It didn't fit my I Phone 5C as recommended from the supplier.  I had to return it.
-1,"Was a great charger... until it stopped working.  Only had it for 2 months and now whenever I plug it in, itll say that its charging but it wont.  Amazon says its past the return period, so now Im stuck with a dead charger case."
1,Arrived fast and is very nice!

-1,Very cute case but it really doesn't fit the phone very well.  I have a hard time with the downward swipe because the case is positioned too far over the top of the phone.  Spend a little more money and get a better fitting case.
-1,A joke  melt me a product that have been returned it was broken the belt clip was broken and the case was cracked I'm pissed
1,Very satisfied with this purchase.
1,"Fantastic little speaker. I didn't have high expectations for the speaker, but was pleasantly surprised. This speaker does exactly what I wanted it to do. Awesome product at such a fair price. We enjoy leaving one in different rooms for convenience. Very easy to use too!"
1,Worked as advertised
1,A+++
-1,-  the bluetooth is very bad if the phone 3 step away from the headset you loss the connect<br />-  the headset is alway fall from your ear<br />-  only good one is wenn the call coming you just take it and put in your ear ...you ready to talk ...don't ne
0,"Has little to no protection, I've broken my phone twice using this case. The card slot is, at first, too tight but once the leather stitching rips along the Side it becomes too lose"
-1,Beautifully designed but doesn't work. Only thin cases will slide into the holder and forget about the watch staying in place. It constantly slides off causing the connection to fail. No response from company about the problem.
1,Big discount for quick fair review ;) very happy.
-1,Cord doesn't fit
1,thank you nice
1,Wife loves it.
1,snug fit on my iphone 6 plus
-1,Cheaply Made. Breaks easily.
-1,"They are great quality, and the battery life is extremely long. So why one star? Because once the battery died, it never charged. I left it plugged in for a week, turned it on, first thing I hear is &#34;Low Battery&#34; then it died a minute later. I left it charging another week and it wouldn't even turn on that time."
1,Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
-1,Very Fragile.  Did not last a week on my Son's phone before it was shattered
1,"I ordered a replacement battery for my Samsung tablet.  It was kinda hard to get the case open and the old battery out but after that, we inserted the new battery and my tablet is like new again.  Great purchase from Amazon."
0,"Fits perfectly, works for every port on ipod except for headphone/aux cable jack... the aux cable that I have is too wide to fit into the jack when the case is on."
1,"I have tried other Bluetoothsbut they never fit or sound right I found that all the Motorola ones that I tried satisfied . I saw this one a great price so, I bought it ."
1,"I absolutely love my JOTO! I got it and did the initial test with the paper towel and it passed, and then I brought it to the pool. I took some underwater videos with it, and the videos were crystal clear. My iPod touch (which I used to record) didn't get a drop of water on it. I would recommend this to everyone who wants a good, working case to take underwater photos and videos, or just to bring to the pool or beach so their device doesn't get wet or dirty. I look forward to future use of my JOTO waterproof case!"
1,Love this item with long cord!!!
1,"This is just perfect for perfect for my garage. Sounds great,couldn't be more pleased."
1,Just  as described.  It makes me feel like I have a brand new phone...
1,"No complaints so far. I had feared they may not be Apple Certified, but all my devices are accepting them without any issues."
-1,"I bought this for a trip I was going to go on and I took it out of the box and plugged into my iPhone 6 and it did not work, also tried it on an iPhone 5s and I didn't work as well maybe I got a defective one but it did not work for me, very disappointing."
-1,The edges don't stay down. Will return
1,Did not think I would find these batteries due to the age of the equipment.... but these batteries fit like the originals. Charged just fine and work perfectly.
1,Been good so far. Did pop off once when I dropped it but snapped right back on.
1,Good.
1,Very nice. A bit bulking but protects very well.
1,Was even better then I thought...easy install and it really does protect your investment...great product
0,"Flimsy, doesn't protect the corners or Tue screen, but it was cheap so what do I expect"
1,"Very high quality, suitable price. Thank you"
1,Free sample from AMZ.<br />Nice package and fast delivery.<br />Not hard to open.<br />Clear guide to stick on the phone. High quality of glass screen protector.<br />Very easy to make it done.
1,Fits my watch perfectly.
1,beautiful! fits great! shows snot when sneezed on.
1,"The pro charge power inverter is the perfect accessory to have when traveling. I usually let my husband drive so that I can read or catch up on work. I ordered the pro charge inverter to charge my laptop in the car. The inverter is easy to use. All you need to do is plug the cord in your cigarette plug. It can charge up to four devices at once, two using the USB port and two with the AC ports. I have no problem charging my phone, my husbands and my laptop all at once. The cord is 36 inches long and will reach the backseat of our car. This device is perfect for my family. I received this item in exchange for my honest review."
1,Great screen protector! It is not really thick so it looks nice on the phone. Barely noticeably on the phone.
-1,Case is too big for my phone. Case covers up part of flash and phone slides around  inside case a little. Major disappointment.
0,It works.  If it falls to low on the arm it starts to bounce and wobble.  Would be nice if it had two bands that were farther apart for a more stable connection to the arm.  Otherwise just move up close to your armpit.
-1,[[ASIN:B00F3583S8 Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Standard Battery]]<br /><br />The battery doesn't work and it looks like a used one.  Don't buy it from the dealer I pasted here.  It's a scam.
-1,"After 1 month of use, it burned up and also burned the cable while charging my iphone. Thanks god it didn't broke the phone."
1,"So just wanted you to know, your Selfie Stick is so good that it was stolen the second time I used it!<br />Right off the table I was sitting at :(<br />Guess i’ll have to buy one - or two - more!!!"
1,Very heavy and bulky (it's about the same size as my note 4) but it charges very quickly and is compatible with the samsung wireless replacement back for a note 4. The powerbank is made of pretty nice materials so it feels good to hold.
1,Worked well
1,Great case.
-1,disapointing. Charges so slowly. I believed the hype that it was going to do a good job.
1,great
1," It's not every day that you find a portable charger that is able to charge from solar energy, but is also shock and water resistant so that you can leave it virtually anywhere to charge and it'll still be pretty safe."
1,"Nice looking case, hard but soft, but the painting in the hard case start to scrape off a bit, no big deal, i love my case"
1,work great
1,"This cable was exactly what I was searching for and had a very high rating. Upon reading the comments, I saw that a lot of the reviews came from reviewers that received this cable as a promotion. This was worrying to me, but since it was exactly what I wanted- I ordered it anyway.<br /><br />It was a good decision. This is my favorite cable I've ever used. It feels sturdy and syncs data. The ends feel like they're made of aluminum, the braided cable doesn't tangle when I put it in my bag and it fits my Otterbox Commuter case for my 6+.<br /><br />It's about a month later and NRGized (the seller) sent me an email stating if there were any problems to contact them and the cable comes with a 12 month warranty. Very good experience so far.<br /><br />I'll update this review if anything changes."
1,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
1,Received product fast and as described
1,"G-Hub - This OnePlus ONE Screen Display Case with built in stand arrived neatly packaged in a cellophane bag which enabled great visibilty of the product.<br />With a black textured cover, this horizontal flip style case comes with an integrated viewing stand. A great feature of this product, is that the cover houses two windows which are strategically placed allowing the user to see who is calling as well as accepting or declining the call without having to open the case.<br />In comparison to other flip style cases this is easy to use, incoming calls that are easily accessible with a modern clean exterior. A fantastic affordable product"
0,My phone kept coming loose and if not for the rubber band I would have lost it
0,"Love the idea and ease of use - however, we live on a country road and in a rural community. The occasional bump and rough roads cause the device to slowly come lose and we find ourselves having to push it back into the vent quite often."
1,"Beautiful, durable, protective"
-1,very bad quality.. couldn't use it for 2 weeks
1,Excellent .
1,It's a very good pole. Fits my daughters iphone5 and she loves it. It stretches out far and it seems sturdy and well made.
1,love that it didn't block the other plug in the double outlet
1,Great charger that has saved me quite a few time!  Took this with me to Disneyland where we stayed all day. I was able to keep my phone charged all day which was perfect since I took a ton of pictures which normally drains my battery.  I was able to charge up two cell phones that day with one charge to this charger and that alone made this purchase worth it!
1,"Best case ever. Used for a long time. Coloring came off when I tried to clean it, or I'd still use it"
1,"Given the price, it should be obvious that these are not going to be the highest quality cords.<br />So far, I've had one die after a couple months of use. Not to the point that it is entirely unusable, but to the point that I have to make sure it is actually charging, or I wake up (like this morning) to a phone that has shut itself off due to the cord not making good contact.<br />Good thing I have 9 more."
1,Perfect
1,Great product.  Exceptional quality.<br />Will order another 1
1,yes
-1,"I have found that these don't connect well with my phone.  I haven't tried other phones, but I've tried multiple cables.  I have to jiggle it and set it down just right to get the phone to charge."
-1,Completely wrong case
-1,"After using it as charging cable next to my night stand because of it's length. I started to notice that it would not charge my phone. I was never rough or neglecting it in any way. Upon further inspection I noticed the end that plugs into my IPhone was loose. Next thing you know, it broke off. The length and durability of the cable are a plus, but the end breaking off makes the integrity of it questionable."
1,Great screen protector!
1,It stays clipped to your pocket good and has a nice grip. Only gripe is that the kick stand is a little awkward and the grip on the inside of the holder catches the case when your taking it out.
1,"Hands down, the best earbuds you can get for under $100."
-1,Only used 1 time doesnt work anymore 😡<br />Its a nice and small stick but that happends to me
-1,It is not for BMW X5 2008
1,I give 5 stars just because my brother said it work good for him.<br />He love it No complaints
1,"Simple fast car charger. Works as intended. Can charge two iPhones rapidly at once, which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />5 stars."
1,The three piece design is very functional and protects your phone too!  First your phone goes into a silicone sleeve then into a rubberized cover and slides into the belt clip holder.  I like it.
1,Great product this is the second one ive ordered. They work great. I will be getting another
1,exactly as described. easy to push buttons if you are familiar with otterbox.
1,On a recent business trip to NY my coworker had one of these and was basically everyone's best friend. They charged up everybody! Had to have one of my own.
1,I bought it for my mom and she loves it
1,"► Pros:<br />✓ 20,000 mAh, thats a lot of charging between devices<br />✓ The big daddy of the portable charger world, holding about 2-3 times more charge<br />✓ Dual charging ports, so you can keep two devices charged up<br />✓ Battery life indication, so you know how soon till you need to give it a charge or how long you can keep charging your own device(s)<br />✓ Has more mAh than my old laptop battery!<br />✓ They didnt add a useless flashlight into it.<br /><br />► Cons:<br />⊗ It's a tad long<br /><br />► Conclusions and final thoughts:<br />For this amount of mAh (this is the amp hours your device will last, more is better) it has to be long, tall, or wide. If you don't wear skinny jeans you can drop this into any of your pockets, even the side leg pocket for carpenter pants (think thats designed for the handle of a hammer). We only have two cellphones in the house and from max charge (owned this for about 10 days), i havent been able to kill the battery. So, it's done its job, more over than any other portable charger i've owned to date.<br />If you have a power hungry device, going on a trip, this might be the single go to device you should get."
1,great quality
1,Thanks
1,A very good case.  It works great.
1,"Absolutely perfect. Inexpensive yet it works! Simple to apply; not bulky; affordable. You can apply this with probably any case, since the cover is recessed by about 1-2 mm from the edge."
1,"As per other reviews, doesn't fit PERFECTLY there is one corner that doesn't seem to smoosh down, but it does fit, and protect and its smaller and less cumbersome than the other model.  This is perfect for the use I needed, and the bright color helps me find it in my purse!"
1,Love this golf watch.  It has saved me strokes on every round.
0,"I got this as a temporary case until my new one arrives. I'm not too crazy about this one. The volume buttons are hard to push; unless you have nails, then you're not gonna be able to adjust your volume. The rubber part seems flimsy."
1,"Great wallet case, fits phone perfectly and love the colors."
-1,"I brought this phone in June and since I have had so many problems with I! It used a Samsung phone in the past years and I never had problems with it. But this phone is just catastrophic!!!! The follwong problems;<br />It sometimes charge properly and sometimes I leave it hours on the charger and it does not charge fully,<br />_sometiomes the battery runs out very quick (sometimes not!!)<br />Sometimes I can make phone calls sometimes not; for example, when I call a  number which I all the time, sometimes I am able to call and ost of the time it tells me &#34;not registered on the network&#34;!!!!<br />When I send sms' s or messages on whatsup or viber, sometimes they go on time and I receive messages on time, but sometimes it takes hours until I receive a message that was sent hours ago or vice versa.<br /><br />Those are just some of the problems I can recall now. I went couple of times to my phone carrier and they replaced the chip card assuming  it might be from them, but the same problems continued over and over again.<br />Don't buy this phone!! It cames with a looooot of problems!!!"
-1,"They are very small and even with the extensions, it's very hard to fit them in my head."
1,"Great color leather, holds cards in well (I've never had more than 2 in a slot usually one), stands the phone up at a good angle for viewing, love it."
-1,Too lose does not provide any protection
-1,it didn't fit well.  It looked nice but extremely hard to put on.  I thought either my phone was going to break or the cover was.
1,"This case is by far the best out there for the price.<br /><br />The rubber-like outside material is smooth and tough (except around the edges, just a little excess) thus making it easy to grab on to. The inside hard plastic piece is rugged and durable allowing for drops to be absorbed through the casing. Again, the plastic has a little excess around the edges. The only problem I face with the inside casing is that it's a bear to take on and off; however after minor adjustments I have not needed to take it off since.<br /><br />As for the plastic covering the various holes and ports, they cover everything with a secure fit so dirt will stay out, which is very nice.<br /><br />Then there's a screen protector. Oh boy, the screen protector. First off, I noticed the plastic was being scratched very easily by normal wear-and-tear inside my pocket. Also, the plastic has a faded off-white appearance that looks dirty and makes the screen more reflective of outside light.<br /><br />Also with the internal frame, the plastic ridges on the sides, top and bottom next to the screen are very high. It's hard, for example, to close ads that are in the corners or on the edges, or to play games that involve you to tap in any of those locations. It could also be that I have stubby fingers, but to me those ridges seemed unnecessarily high.<br /><br />The most annoying thing however was that the protector did not meet the screen, so I was having to push harder for the touch screen to register. That was very annoying. To fix this problem I took to it with my handy pocket knife. I found that the screen protector was secured to the internal plastic frame by only a couple dabs of cheap glue. I was able to easily pry off the plastic.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great buy for the extremely cheap price. I am very happy with my purchase."
1,Great
1,just what i needed
1,"Love it, wish I had more of this type to choose from with the same great price."
1,Works great with my LGg4.
1,I was able to get this product at a discount for an exchange of my review. The case fits my phone like a glove. I needed a new one since my old one was all scratched up and beat up from all the drops my daughter did while playing with it. With the new case it is as durable as my old one and have no issues with my screen not working or anything. My daughter has already dropped it a few times and the phone is safe! That is all that matters!!! The case saved the phone!
1,"LOVE this case!!! Arrived on time, as promised. Fits my LG G3 like a second skin. My fire red phone looks beautiful and shiny, and totally protected. For screen protection I added a ballistic glass screen protector and now my new phone is safe . . . AND GORGEOUS!"
0,"The arm band I give a 4 star. It is comfortable and stays in place well. It also holds my I phone 5s very snug. The screen protector that came with it because you have to have it out of a case to fit, unless you have a small case, was already cracked when I got it. I was disappointed about this because I was looking forward to putting it on my phone."
1,Bona fide FAST CHARGERS!  Too many sellers claim that their products are fast chargers but they're not what they claim to be.  THESE are the real deal!  I will definitely do business with this seller in the future!  Thanks!
1,So happy I bought this when I did.  I bought this right before we left for a trip to New York City.  Works great charging our devices.  My only complaint is that it is a little on the heavy side but other then that love it.
1,My wife loves it. I think it's absurd.
1,"Ever since I had my first iPhone I have used Tech Armor screen protectors. The glass screen protector works very well, protects against scratches and dropping. I have never had an issue with their protectors."
0,"This otterbox is the third one I've had on my iPhone 5.... the previous two both broke in the same exact spots - at the bottom by the charging port. I am not rough on phones- this is the first case I've ever had that broke so quickly and I've NEVER broken a phone by dropping it! BUT... with that said, my phone is still alive, and shows absolutely no signs of the impacts that caused the cases to break, which is what it's for. So, if you want a case to protect your phone and you don't mind replacing it every 6 months or so, then this is the case for you."
1,"I've ordered multiple sets of these cables, to replace various USB charging cables that have worn out and stopped working.  These cables have solid construction and good connection when plugged in.  So far no problems with connector failure due to strain at the plug end.  Excellent value."
1,"Fits phone perfectly. A little struggle to get the phone out of the case, but I got it to protect the phone and will not be taking it out often. So okay with that."
1,I LOVE IT CAN PUT IT ON MY JEANS BELT LOOP AND PUT IPHONE IN IT AND TRACK MY STEPS  WONDERFUL
0,It's really good looking. However one small mistake and it's damaged. Too bad.
1,"Very sturdy and attractive cases. Only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the hard outer case is just that, seriously hard.<br />Putting the hard outer case on the cellphone with the other two cases requires some work. Not saying it's not well done. It just doesn't snap in with the ease I thought it should.<br />I don't use it as a clip-on. I like the extra protection and the rotating stand. That's a really cool extra.<br />Can't use the camera?<br />Sure you can.<br />I simply got a utility knife and carved out the back of the case in an area big enough for the camera, flash, and microphone. It's about 1/2 inch wide and approximately 2 inches long.<br />Bingo!<br />Extra protection in a hard shell, a better stand that rotates, what more could you possibly want?<br />I highly recommend this case.<br />It fits the phone perfectly.<br />Extremely reasonable price."
-1,Dont buy it
-1,Broke after 1 wk
0,"Soft rubber, easy to put in and put out,  so far is protecting well the cell phone"
1,"secure fit, very well made"
1,Works great
1,stays on window very good. has stayed in place for several months now without having to restick
1,just what I needed.
1,"Great product and easy to apply if you follow the directions! This protector really does what it is intended to do, I dropped my phone and the screen protector cracked but the actually screen is completely fine. Definitely worth it!!"
1,Great cheap phone holder. Stays in the vents well and doesn't scratch them. Will buy again if I accidentally leave this in a rental car or something.
1,"This has to be by far the best screen protector I have ever used - aligns perfectly to my Zenfone 2. This was the FIRST time in my life that I've installed a screen protector without any air bubbles or dust, and the pain associated with them. Very happy with the purchase, and at a great price."
1,I love it. Air in a a car smells smells better and feels cooler. USB ports are very handy.
1,This is a very powerful power bank not those little sticks you normally see on the mall kiosk.  I have a Samsung note 3 with big battery so this is powerful enough. I can charge at least 3 to 4 times.<br /><br />The other thing I like is it looks so beautiful. The picture isn’t doing it justice. By the way it is made of bamboo with really intricate carving not wood.
1,Nicely made.  Doesn't topple over easily.
1,"Works well, good price."
1,"works and does its function, great case"
1,"Excellent product. Exceeded expectations. Awesome sound quality, BLUE tooth range, features. Highly recommend this product"
1,"Works well, Looks great and so far, its very durable!"
1,Works great. Not a single problem.
1,Really awesome and really easy to use.highly recommended.
1,I've owned more expensive wireless headsets but they don't perform any better.  This is my fav and when I've lost it and had to reorder... this is my go to headset!
1,Worked GREAT
-1,"THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT FROM A NEW COMPANY THAT HAS A BAD PRODUCT<br />after two weeks of the earpieces separated, exposing the wires. When i contacted the company i was told i had gotten a defective product, but they did'nt have any inventory for a few weeks; hoping i could wait.In addition, it took about 10 days to arrive when i first ordered it.The range of this headset is about 10 feet, whic is far less than my LG.<br />Per the company customer service, this is a brand new company located in Germany They clearly do not know what they are doing. I had an LG for 3 years with no problems...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. AVOID THIS PRODUCT"
1,Got to me very quickly and was exactly what I needed.
-1,sorry to say I was just not impressed.
1,Love the case. Very protective. Just a bit too thick. Makes phone more bulky then I'd prefer.
1,The phone case is great! I recommend highly.
1,"I originally bought this for my daughters Blu Studio 5 but i now use it for my blu life one X. The holes don't match up at all and I have to use my silicone case over the phone in the case but my daughter no longer needed it so at least it isn't going to waste. It has Two credit card slots, an ID card slot and a cash area."
1,Great radio sound good.
1,Protects whole phone doesn't leave sticky film after!
1,Great cheap case. Only bad thing is that the kick stand is low so the viewing angle sucks.but the tech armor glass fits perfect.
1,My new iPhone 5 is my partner in crime while mountain biking or hitting the slopes. This tough and rugged case has turned my smart phone into a mountable action case. Really easy to use!
1,Great product works perfectly
1,"It's a soft matte case that helps protect the camera from touching the surface you're setting the phone on (which is the main reason I even have a case on the phone) without adding bulk. The cool benefit is the port covers which actually do a good job. The buttons so an amazing job at preserving the tactility of the buttons. The material is such that it has a bit of abrasiveness to keep it from flying off of surfaces but it shows the marks/scratches...all in all, it's not a bad case. For the price, if you're looking for a slim durable case...this is definitely a good choice.  -Edit- I bumped up my rating, initially I gave it 4 starts because of it showing the scratches/marks on the back, but it turns out that they disappear after a while...to be honest, I bought a TON of cases for this phone, and this is still my favorite."
1,"I do photo And video with this phone inside of the water<br />It does not shoot clearly ( clear shots , or maybe it was the quality / color of nyc beach ) underneath the water but ask for it being<br />waterproof and being able to be in the water with it it is amazing!! I am so pleasantly pleased after skeptism.... worth every penny.... I got good photography"
0,"Extremely slow performance.  Very frustrating to use.  Poor response on touch screen.  Cosmetically, looks great, but I could not get past the problems and returned it."
1,Gorilla glass screen protectors are so amazing. This isn't the first one I've bought and it won't be the last. They protect so well even from drops. The first time I dropped my phone with a glass screen protector I was scared my screen was cracked too under the protector. I pulled it off with relief seeing how perfectly it protected my screen. I will never use a different protector again! I recommend these to everyone and amazon is the best place to buy one. It came fast and well protected. This is a perfect fit.  I received this at a discount for my honest review.
1,Great phone for the price!  Easy to use!
1,"I have it working, I love it. Excellent"
1,Amazing phone case!  My husband likes it so much that when he change phones he order another one. He works in construction and he drops the phone alot and nothing has happened to the phone because of the material it bounces its like a rubber material. I really recommend.
1,excellent! Thank you
1,quickly charges the phone....
-1,I bought it and now returning it since Im not very happy with it. The USB 4-5 inches cable that came with it was found to be very loose and not working with the Samsung S6 edge I recently bought - while driving I tried to put my cell on but it kept on coming off. Now its a different story that you can buy a pack of 5 USB cables (of 4-5 inch each) on Amazon for just 3-4 bucks - so it may not be as serious issue may be. Secondly this charger didn't come with its own charging cable  You got to find one of your own. Everyone has one but that was kind of unexpected. Also while on my recent trip I put it on charging with my cell phone also hooked up. Next day morning I found it had only 2 blue lights on - not all the 4. So the continuous charging didnt really work for me. I am just sending it off.
1,WORKS GREAT
1,Love it! Works well love this phone and the business this seller does.
1,This works great....
1,This case is perfect for my zik 2.0
1,"Placed on phone quickly, perfect fit, nice color.. seems very sturdy. The price is right"
1,"We used this on a road trip, worked great."
1,loved it
-1,"case really nice but back hook (which also has a belt look) was just glued on and came off within a week.  Sorry, but not made well"
1,"I needed rock-solid, &#34;can't tell I'm on a headset&#34; phone connection, and this comes pretty close.<br /><br />A few people (seems to be phone-dependent on their side) say when they talk they hear a bit of echo back. Everybody says I sound great, and they can't tell I'm on a headset. The noise-canceling feature is amazing, and I can be outside with the garbage truck coming by, and people say they can't hear it in the background.<br /><br />BONUS: If the RF signal from cell phones is somehow damaging to humans, (causes cancer, etc. -- not saying it does, just IF), having this small local signal near the brain instead of the whole cell phone should be a major improvement. The phone itself can be several feet away, happily working without damaging me."
1,"First  I need to say that I only bought this camera about a week ago, so this review is only a first impression. The Good: 1) Video quality is very good and the price is more than fair. 2) Long power cable 3) Good suction cup 4) Auto start when you turn the ignition ON 5) LCD display that allow you to view the video and play back  The not so good: What I don’t like and think it might cause issues in the future , is that the camera getting very hot when you touch it, which make me believe when the electronic components inside getting to hot , and this is not something that can survive for a long time (Time will tell I guess) and this is hot regardless of being on the windshield in the California sun. 2) The recording loop option only good for 1,3,5 minutes. I wish it will have the option to record all the way with no limit straight until the card is full and loop recording from the beginning when the card is full 3) the worse part about this camera is the window reflection that I wish was not appearing in the recorded video . I mounted under the rear view mirror which is perfect location from the view angle , but the reflection from the window  is a BIG issue which I really don’t like.  Would I recommend it ?  Yes but for the simple reason of price and video resolution. It’s a very basic camera that will do what you looking for in events driving recordings."
1,really good 5 stars
1,This is a good value and a nice set. My only complaint is I wish they were slightly easier to put in and secure for workouts. However I would recommend these to a friend as overall there really nice.
1,Exactly what I was expecting beautiful color and style.
0,"This cable is far superior to others on the market, however I purchased in January and now in August it's completely frayed and disabled. Supposedly there is a warranty but I can't find who to contact or how to go about submitting it. Yes, for the price its a great deal but I wish it had lasted longer. An &#34;L-shaped&#34; lighting end would have been super helpful."
1,Great n long enough
1,If you have an Apple Watch you know how annoying it can be to charge it without being held up by something. This stand solves the problem perfectly and looks really nice. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who owns an apples watch!
1,It is a great sport watch but some times it gets freezed and you have to reset it.
1,Fits my 4s extremely well. I have the clear version and it is not cloudy. Feels solid.
0,I just received this cord and it seems to work find but does not fit through the iPhone 6 Otterbox case. The opening to the case is too small and the end of the charging cord is bigger than the original cord. It does work with my sons iPhone 5s Otterbox and my iPad case.
1,Pretty darn good for the price.
1,Exactly what you want if you are looking to protect but add as little bulk as possible to an iPhone 6+.  Perimeter is rubber and stands about 2 or 3 mm above screen. Back is harder plastic. Might not save you from a 5 story drop but should save screen from the shattering from the face diwn drop on the garage floor.
1,Great seller. Good item
-1,"I went for this glass cover because the image shows a cutout that covers more real estate on the Note 5 than the others.  See the photos attached, so disappointed in them.<br /><br />I saved a photo of the product image just in case it gets changed somehow as well.<br /><br />It's a SOLID piece of glass let me tell you, so I gave it 2 stars instead of one, but you need to know what you are getting.<br /><br />Update:  My wife noticed on 9/3/15 that the pic has been changed to reflect the actual product shipped.  Good for them to update it.<br /><br />Overall I enjoy the glass on my note 5 it's thick and applied great.  Thanks!"
0,"I bought mine for the LG G2, and I'm leaving this review on the product I purchased. So if you're reading this for a different phone, it's because Amazon lumps several product's review pages together.<br /><br />I've had it a little over a month, now, and it's got all kinds of little scratches on it. Not sure how, I've never set it face down, and I never put anything else in the pocket it's in. Took a slight impact on day 2, so it also has a chip in the side and a cute little crack to go with it. I feel like it was a very easy impact, and I wouldn't have thought it would have been enough to cause any damage. My guess is that since the face of the phone's glass is curved, the glass is just unsupported at the edges and more prone to breakage. Even if I hadn't had an impact, because of the unsupported glass, there's a very noticeable ring all the way around the screen. Maybe it's the best protector that could exist, given the design of the phone. Maybe it's the best that could exist at this price. But it's definitely not the best screen protector experience that's possible."
0,Case is great. Screensaver is junk can't not get it clean enough to have it work right
1,Charges my phone almost all the way.
1,"Real good cheap replacement for blown speakers. Not loud or powerful though as you can guess, certainly not more than the factory speakers on most cars. However I can hear music and that's what they need to do. Good for a quick fix!"
1,"Just received it and love it, it has the feel of an otterbox. So far its getting a five star rating. Will update again after a couple weeks but I believe its gonna hold up to drops, and the style is awesome."
1,Good!
1,"Great phone! Ordered from Mobile Group USA. Was delivered  promptly, within estimated delivery date. Had for several months and the phone is working well. Rear camera takes decent pictures. Battery lasts typically for about 6-7 hours of usage. When on standby, battery lasts longer."
1,"Good, solid feeling case. I like the swivel clip. Fortunately I haven't actually put it through a drop test yet."
-1,It blew as soon as I turned it loud enough to hear it with some road noise. Worthless. You get what you pay for.<br />.
1,"Works great, would definitely recommend."
-1,"Super poorly made, took FOREVER to get. Not worth it. 2 days after I received it, the cheap plastic literally broke in half as I was trying to get it off to get to my battery to change."
0,The volume keys on the phone is very glitch with this cover.  I like it otherwise.
1,Does exactly what it says on the Tin
1,"Fast delivery, excellent product!"
1,Great product. I recommend it to anyone needing a portable charger for phone or other electronic device!
1,My favorite case so far! It has worn down pretty quickly tho!
-1,Doesn't work with vents that the guides move vertically up and down. Holds your device securely though. Just really disappointed with the vent mounting.
1,"Honestly I was not expecting much from this product. I bought a four pack thinking we would use it for our kids book bags etc.<br /><br />I now have a tile on my keys, work ID, wallet, and computer bag. Probably the best purchase I have made in 5 years.<br /><br />The tile themselves are a little thicker than I imagined, but I got over that quickly. My wallet is the only item, for which it really makes a difference."
1,"owning so many iPhone 6 in this house scares me to death to have without have a glass screen protector on them. The ones in the stores cost so much money and they don't seem to last that long for the price you pay for them<br />The Siania screen protector arrived and I was so happy because it came just in time when my daughters IPhone arrived:) I had my husband put it on and he said that it was easy to apply and it looks great on her phone. No smudges are anything. You can't even tell that it is on there at all:) I'm very happy with it and so is she. Normal screen protectors without the glass show so much that you just want to rip the screen protector off,but these you don't want to:)<br />I highly recommend this. It not only protectors your phone,but if it cracks usually its just the screen protector and at this price you can always get another one with no problem:)<br />I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done:)"
1,This case is amazing and worth every penny! It arrived earlier than the expected date. It does has port covers on the bottom which surprised me but other than that great case!
1,This should be bundled with Metra Axxess ASWC-1 Universal Steering Wheel Control Interfance or it should be in the product description that when the Chevrolet Cruze has a steering wheel control it needs the Metra Axxess ASWC-1 Universal Steering Wheel Control Interfance
1,"Jesus stop freaking begging me to review this, Amazon. Like a whiny two year old. God."
-1,At first I was quite pleased with the product.  It fit well and provided easy access.  My joy lasted a whole two weeks and then the phone retaining latch broke off.  Fortunately I had my hand near my iPhone and caught it on the way down.
0,"I purchased this charger so that I could just plop my phone down on it when going to bed - and wake up with a full battery.  Unfortunately, that's not exactly how it works.  Samsung REALLY needs to upgrade the firmware on this device.<br /><br />If you place your phone on the pad to charge, it stops charging when the phone hits 100%.  That means, for the rest of the night, the phone is still sitting on the pad, but is now using it's own battery power.  It won't start charging again unless you pick up the phone from the pad and put it back down.<br /><br />This is a major oversight in my opinion.  The pad should sense when the phone is not at 100% and start charging again - WITHOUT you having to pick it up and put it back down on the pad again."
1,I bought this over a year ago and have used it flawlessly several times camping and when the power goes out to charge my phone.  I like it so much I'm buying another one.
1,This case was perfect it fit my daughters iPod perfectly she actually connected the keychain to the case she loves it I give this five stars😊 I am happy with what I got
1,Works as advertised so far.  I would buy it again.
1,great buy
1,Loving it in every way. With the small exception that it doesn't have a hourly chime at the top of each hour. But a small price to pay. But no real complaints.
1,can't go wrong with intex. we use this at Santa Catalina Island. we get more compliments and fun comments as people cruise by us. It is very comfortable and will hold 4 adults on the couch and 2 in the seats!
-1,Worked great for a while. Then it would only read that the product wasn't supported by Apple and would no longer charge.
1,Took it with me to EDC! It's a great buy!
-1,the left ear piece was extremely low..i would like to exchange it
1,Works as promised great product.
1,First off I'm huge on boxing and I love how the item is boxed. The sound is crystal clear which makes it hard to differentiate from a cd. I don't see why people rate it any lower than 4 stars. Just an FYI you DO have to have a stereo head with an aux input built in for the device to work. One thing that I forgot to mention was you can charge to of your devices at the same time which is awesome.
1,"I just purchased my apple watch with a simple black band and thought about buying more band colors but did not want to spend $40 per band from apple. I thought I might find a similar band on Amazon for less money and I was right. This color of the band is great and i have received a lot of compliments already. I have worn it running, paddle boarding (I know the apple watch is not rated for water), and in the gym. It is secure and very, ver  comfortable. The band was very easy to put on and take off, it adjusts just like an apple band and the color is true to the apple green. I just ordered 2 more colors."
1,"I Wana write a review for wizard because I ordered four order of these cell phone holder/car mount. I'm using wiz Heart because it is functional, simple, and easy to I install.<br /> I'm gonna order some more for friends. Great job!"
1,It allows me to have a docking station. Works well for what it cost.
1,great......
1,Quick ship and item is just as described!
1,The case has proven to protect my daughters iPhone 6. It's not bulky and it's really cute.
1,Best idea ever.  Especially on vacation and family reunions.
1,Perfect for keeping in the truck. It is about 6 inches long. Let's me charge either my iPhone or my Bluetooth headset while driving. No need for two cables cluttering up my console.<br />Very happy. Price was excellent.
1,Fits great
-1,The user manual is all but useless. They don't explain the steps in near enough detail. In my opinion this is not a user friendly dash cam. Still trying to get video to play on computer but the steps they say needed for playback aren't getting me there. Some buttons you have to hold for a period of time others you don't and certain buttons need to be hit before others. The manual says nothing about the ok button they ask you  to use. Just so you know its the record button and the manual calls it the confirmation key. ( think they could have just called it what it is THE RECORD BUTTON ) The manual totally amps up the aggravation in using this dash cam. If you're lucky or smart enough to figure it out I'm sure its a great little unit. I found the play back as I'm writing. It amazes me how a company can create such high tech. and then screw up the manual so bad. Is it to much to ask for a company to put just a little thought into the manual. The manual should say press X for 3 seconds then use the MIC button then when menu comes up here are the additional steps. Its just an absurdly written manual that assumes you know more than some of us do.
1,This is great.  I use it solely for my TV so that I can transmit from it to my headphones while I am on the treadmill.  I had been looking for something to give my TV a Bluetooth connection and both Best Buy and HH Gregg said it didn't exist so I was nervous about this at first but it definitely works.  The one complaint I have is the volume.  I'm not sure if it's attributable to the transmitter or the headphones I am using but I have to turn the TV volume almost all the way up to make it loud enough while I work out (not a huge deal unless I forget how loud it is and unplug the transmitter).
-1,JUNK!A WASTE OF MONEY!FLIMSY NO GRIP!WORTH ABOUT $1
1,"Dang, this is a thick and sturdy screen cover. It's probably about 2mm thick, and it's not the slightest bit flexible. It's pretty much an extra glass screen.<br /><br />There are several things I like about this screen protector. What I like best is that it came with a guide to help put it on. Basically, you create a hinge out of some stickers and flip the protector onto the screen like a cover on a book. That made it so much easier and less nerve-wracking - plus, no worries about bubbles under the screen protector! From there, its own weight pushes it down and seals it onto the iPhone.<br /><br />The screen protector also does not get in the way of a case, and it's smear and stain resistant. It's always easy to wipe it off. It hasn't smudged or scratched once, and the sides do not collect dirt like other screen protectors I've seen.<br /><br />I like this a lot."
1,"Keeping in mind the price point of this pair of inexpensive Brainwavz Jive in-earphones, and comparing it with the in-ears' positive attributes, I can easily give it a five star rating:  Well-balanced sound, with decent vocals and instruments;  a very comfortable fit; lightweight housing;  gold-plated audio plug-in; a mic that works flawlessly and conveys your words crisply and clearly; nicely pliable, low memory cables; a classy look--with three color choices; four pairs of tips, (including a pair of Comply); and a nice, zippered, hard carry case (that other companies sell, similar but smaller, for ten bucks).<br /><br />Sound is easy on the ears:  Dynamic and energetic; (Brainwavz calls it &#34;lively&#34; and that is a good description.)  The sound is not muddy, flat or congested.  There is decent definition/resolution, good range, and a definite stereo effect.<br /><br />What you need to accept for this price point:  The sound engineers had to make concessions somewhere:  Bass is not booming (and that is not necessarily a bad thing depending on your point of view), and sound is not as rich and full as you get with more expensive in-ears.  Some depth is lost, but details are there.  Sound is somewhat &#34;laid-back&#34;, like it is coming from a bit of a distance.<br /><br />Of note:  Ear tip color match the color of the in-ears and cable, and I kinda' like that; (Comply ear tips are the usual black).  Cable is thicker below the mic, thinner above the mic, to lighten the comfortable feel even more, and I like that feature, too.  Brainwavz has re-designed their zippered, hard case by making it more oblong, instead of squarish.  It means you don't have to roll your cable so tightly and it is easier and quicker to fit it all back in.<br /><br />I chose the red and I'm very happy with that color.  It is a rich red on the metal housing--I might call it &#34;lipstick red&#34;.  The tips are a matching translucent red, and the cables are more of a deeper red to red/brown color.  Really nice looking, not garish at all.<br /><br />*I received a free sample product from Brainwavz.n color.  Really nice looking, not garish at all.<br /><br />*I received a free sample product from Brainwavz."
1,"LOVE THIS!!!! If you hate charging your phone and always being attached to a wall, this is perfect. The quality of the batteries is the same quality as the battery that originally came with my phone. I'm on my phone a lot so that used to mean I had to charge my phone a lot as well, but now when my battery is low, I just switch it out and recharge the other battery. I've had the batteries and charger for 6 months now and I'm still impressed. I definitely recommend this product!"
1,"Seems to really do the job, only time will tell."
1,"They're Awesome!,.I like the style & they're comfortable..Definitely worth the price."
-1,The stones keep coming off
1,My daughter loved this and got a lot of complements from her friends.
-1,This v.very bad Item i lost my iphone6 because of this case it says it water proof but in fact its not i was using it less than 1 meter for 3 min and all water inside so really if u wanna lose ur iphone buy this product im so angry
1,Glad to find the ones for my phone.... Up until now I have been cutting out my own... Really Happy!
1,Thank you!
1,I love it so much I bought another one just for the future if this one wears out holding up really well so far I get lots of compliments on it
1,Wasn't sure when we ordered these if they would be any good we've had them for some time now and they protect the phones very well.
-1,Device broke down in 2 months of use.  Does not turn on.
1,Worked well
1,I am highly impressed with it and can recommend for anyone as a great alternative for a power bank.
1,I scratch and break my phone all the time so this is great for me! I received a discount on my order for a fair review.
1,"I drop things, a lot, and this case has done it's job multiple times. I highly recommend it. I work in an assembly plant and I don't worry about breaking my phone with this case."
1,Fantastic item ....wonderful fast delivery.
1,I love this case it's very cute
1,Blocks outside noise completely and you can turn it up really loud. They fit comfortably and the charge doesn't take long if you leave it there for an hour or so. Connecting it is a piece of cake and they're just awesome.
1,Works perfectly after you get it organized. Amazing ability to get super fun shot. Would recommend it to anyone.  Kind of a plug and play.
1,Use it every where! Keeps my phone charged
1,Very good
1,Very easy to install. Right size!
0,"Broke after about a month, not much space in the wallet space and it rips somewhat easily, I like it but i could be a little better made."
1,Have purchased a few of these and have had no problems with any of them. Highly recommend. NOTE: the plastic on the lightning end is wider than Apple cord so it doesn't fit in the slot of my husband's Otterbox Defender case but fits mine (not Otterbox) just fine.
1,Fit is not quite as great as the Commuter for the Iphone 3GS from a few years back. The case is a good compromise between protection and bulk.
-1,Nice looking watch but i couldn't get texts or emails on watch.
1,"Works as described!  I applied this to the dashboard of a Prius 2013 and it sticks very well.  In addition, I have not had any issues with it coming off during the hot weather.  It stays in place.<br />Overall it works well."
1,The RoadMate works good.  Trying to update maps can be confusing.
1,I've had this case for a couple of weeks now. I LOVE it!  Very protective but not bulky. Perfect balance. The built-in screen protector is perfect. My only complaint... It doesn't come in purple.
1,I bought this charging cable because I kept getting &#34;slow charging&#34; warnings from my HTC One M8 despite the fact that I was using the factory charger and cable. So far I am thoroughly impressed - this cable charges my phone very quickly and seems durable.
-1,"Minimal useful features - half of the apps on the watch are non functional, the radio feature doesn't work without the cheap and ill fitting earbuds, the touchscreen is either overly fiddly or unresponsive when using the on screen keyboard, etc. Surprisingly, I did put a sim card in it from our spare line, and that seems to work, but god help you trying to dial a number on the screen  keypad.<br /><br />The only thing that worked reliably was the notifications from my phone to the watch, but since it'll basically replicate EVERY notification of EVERY type by default, you then have to go into the poorly constructed host app on your phone and disable 99% of them. Oh, did I mention that you have to run a garbage coded scammy looking app and service in the background of the host phone, above and beyond the bluetooth connection, for any of this to &#34;work&#34;?<br /><br />Camera quality is poor. The remote shutter control thing is kinda neat (when it works), allowing you to use the watch to trigger the camera on your phone remotely.<br /><br />Almost no customization of the watch face, fonts, backgrounds, etc. The only saving grace is that it's as cheap as a lot of non smart watches, and it does seem to keep time."
-1,Doesn't fit the entire screen like it's suppose to.
1,lovely case... fits perfectly on my phone and am loving it
1,Got this for international travel and absolutely loved it! It's also a nice thing to have in emergency situations when the power goes out.
1,"Purshased one today, looking for a cheap but good looking phone just to see how those unlocked ones work. Pros: Price,  Big Screen, Kit Kat, Works on Tmobile H+ Nice, download speed of 6.4 mb average on the area purchased ,Puerto Rico,  it uploaded the Tmo network and Apn automaticly,  unboxing, it brings 3 screen protector (one already.placed), charger, earphones and a really cool fitted clear rubber case, everything nicely packed. For the price, 150$ total, it is a nice deal. CONS low ram, low memory 4gigs You can.use the external upgradable to 32 The phone says 8mb camera but it  sucks, pictures look so so, I checked the resolution and.it was at 8mp.maybe I'm just used to my Samsung camera. Still.haven't used the selfie one, so it must be awful too. It dont have an factory android.launcher like  touchwiz home instead brings an next launcher as default app, it look nice, but the icons are crappy, I downloaded the go.launcher and.resolved.it.until.I.can.get the original.kitkat launcher For the price, you just have to drop in an 32 g microsd and.you're.done!"
1,Very good!
1,Thank you..
-1,Do not buy..  Phone was advertised as unlocked.  Don't believe it!!!!!  Said I could contact Huawei to unlock bootloader. That's false too. Wish I could return and buy a phone with support. Stuck on 4.3 and No OTA in future yet Amazon is still selling this phone knowing some of your apps will never work cause the phone is no longer supported.
1,I'm verry happy for this product
1,Perfect. Exactly what I ordered shipped fast and priced fair
1,Perfect
1,This product is like the original usb cable from samsung. Fast and reliable charging. Highly recommended.
0,"This is a really nice looking case and right off the bat as soon as I took it out of the package, I loved it.<br /><br />This case also comes with a tempered glass screen protector, which is a nice bonus since most of the time I have had to purchase those separately whenever I have bought a case in the past. In addition, there is also a pair of cleansing and drying wipes included in the packaging so everything necessary to install the case comes right in the box.<br /><br />I found the case pretty simple to put on, and did not have any issues at all. Once I got the case on my phone, it was time to check everything out, and here is where I found the unfortunate flaw that caused me to rate the case with only 3 stars. All of the cutouts are the correct size and have the correct placement, EXCEPT for the charging port. Because of this, the phone cannot be charged while the case is on. Some people may be able to overlook this flaw, but for me, it is a deal breaker.<br /><br />The case itself is awesome and looks like it would offer a nice amount of protection, but I cannot see myself going through all of the trouble of having to remove the case completely every time that the phone needs to be charged. I received one to review, and this is my honest opinion. Hopefully, there will be an updated case soon with the issue corrected. Other than that design flaw, this would be a great case and I definitely would have used it regularly."
1,"For the price it has done a lot for me. Its been a year and a half and dropped in water within the first 2 months. Had to put it in rice but has been working ok after. Every once in a while there's a freeze on it, but otherwise I try not to download aps. I've put a virus scan on it though since I use the internet feature here and there. Volume seems like it could be louder than what it is for dual speaker."
1,Very pleased with the product. Good quality. Ordered and received in a timely manner.
1,great one i like it
1,Great case that holds a snug fit on s6+. Clear case to show off phones sexiness. 5 stars
0,It was a good case just not what I ordered. Would not fit my phone
1,like having a new phone
-1,We ordered these to use in our Boys & Girls Club.  We rent space in a large building and our rooms are spread out.  Parents come to the front desk and the front desk staff calls over the radio for the child(ren) being picked up.  2 out of 3 of these walkies stopped working within 2  month of buying them.  The warranty that I bought doesn't cover it because we use it in a work setting.  I ordered 3 more in July and 1 out of 3 of those isn't working.  Kids do not handle the walkies.  They sit on a desk by a staff.  I am VERY disappointed in the quality of these walkies for the HIGH price
1,So far i love this product!!! Love just setting it down and having it charge!
1,BOUGHT THE FOR MY DAUGHTERS 14TH BIRTHDAY HUNDREDS CHEAPER THEN A BOSE AND EVERYONE IS HAPPY  I RECOMMEND IT!!
1,The company have a good customer service. I revived the item as described.
1,"It is a nice case, not as safe or bulkly as the Otterbox but compact enough to slip in your pocket for a quick trip to the store without your handbag."
1,Ordered the case for my wife'said phone and she loves it ....very happy with this product....I will order again from your company. ....
-1,very bad product i can't use it as amirror
1,"Good case, thanks!"
1,Good
1,"great cable, worked as described"
1,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item. I'd buy from them again
1,The case looks and feels really good. The only reason this isn't a five start review is because the kickstand feels a little cheap.
1,sturdy and easy to use.
-1,"Unfortunately, the battery wouldn't charge - it was DOA.  The shelf life must have expired.  Would like a replacement.  Thank you."
1,This Ballistic Glass Saved my phone this morning.  I was working out and my phone fell off the treadmill on to cement.  I didn't see any issues until I was in my car.  It looked like the screen was cracked all the way across.  After looking at the phone closer I pealed off the ballistic glass and realized it was the only think cracked.  I had decided to go with the Tech Armor Premium Ballistic Glass for a screen protector after breaking two screens on different phones.  I would recommend this screen to everyone.  I am extremely impressed and can not believe how well it protected my phone.  This glass did what it was supposed to.
1,Works well.  Have put it through the paces and it's solid.
1,"Works well, small size and 2 x 2.4A ports to charge your devices at high speed. i received this product for free to test it and so far im loving it."
1,Great case
-1,"I originally gave this product a great score, after using for almost a year, the small plug has come loose at the stress joint. It does now Not work. This was a great price for a long cord. However you must be more gentle than you really should to keep the very weak stress sleeve from breaking the wire within. I would have to recommend Not to buy this. Spend a bit extra and make sure the plug and stress collar are all one sturdy piece. If you need a long cord and are very, very gentle this may still be just what you need."
1,Great product!
1,I use it a lot. It's light weight and easy to store.
1,"Yes, it did meet & exceed my expectations, so far I have been very impressed at the quality and appearance of the Piel Frama iPhone 6 plus case! I would recomment it to a friend!"
1,Excellent product
1,"It is absolutely THE cutest case ever. I love it so much and I get compliments on it all the time. One flaw is that it can take in a certain smell and smell like that for a while, like I had a bonfire and I had it on and it smelled like smoke for a while, I had to leave it alone and let it air out for like a week or two."
1,"As others have reviewed, this item is excellent quality.  I tried another similar arm band, giving me a benchmark - this one is WAY better, with a nicer feel, quality workmanship and nice features.  Since my 5'2&#34; and 110 lbs gives me puny arms, I had to cut off the second slot so I didn't have so much material on my arm. Now it feels comfortable.  Value can't be beat."
-1,"The summary on the product said these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones, they are not. They arent that comfortable either they fit like childrens library computer headphones. They dont get very loud. They arent noise cancelling at all. :("
0,It didn't meet my expectations the screen protector popped out
1,Bought this for my son's phone which was suggested to me from a friend.  Fits great and will protect the phone which belongs to a 13-year old.
0,very cute!!! colors do fade after a while but thats normal with rubber
1,"I am very happy that I purchased this phone. I switched from a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 because it was outdated and just too big! I was sick of it. So I went out to T-Mobile to upgrade to a new phone but I couldn't find one that was significantly smaller than the Note 2 (5.7&#34; screen). They just do not make normal sized phones anymore. That is where the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7&#34; comes into play. It is the PERFECT SIZE. The only thing big about this phone is the name! Good specs for somebody who just needs a phone for normal use. Yes, it is not the fastest phone out there but for the money, you CAN'T beat it! To be honest, it is very snappy to me and the screen quality is great. Not to mention, the 13MP camera is extremely fast and takes good quality pics.<br /><br />I highly recommend this phone!<br /><br />Also note, in my experience, the Amazon free shipping was extremely slow! I would upgrade to the next available shipping method if you want your phone in less than a week."
1,it was fully charged and i used up all the juice. my phone went from 14 to 87% I think it was. so not fully charged but better than dead and stuck.  does have a handy bag to keep it in in my purse
0,Works great
1,Excellent product - crystal clear!
-1,For the price its a bit too much they feel and look cheap... And to top it off they sent a different style than the ones you see in the picture... But they work right out of the box...
1,Love it like that I can wear it as a purse and wristlet fits everything and I like with everything u still have room to use the coin zipper pocket
-1,Terrible voice nobody can hear me.
0,"I didn't care for these. Clip doesn't seem very secure, I couldn't really see much difference in the wide angle lens verses no lens. But for the price didn't expect much."
1,This Selfie Stick is both well designed and well built. The overall device is smaller and more compact than I expected which is a good thing. Therefore taking it places will not require a second thought.
1,It handles the hard nicks
1,nice!
1,Al Ud excelent
1,"I purchased the Multiple USB Charger-USB Wall Charger, USB Car Charger for my father who still has the older model iPhone 4. It has become close to impossible to find a high quality charger for the older iPhones so I was really happy to find one that includes both a wall charger and car charger.<br />This retractable cord is excellent, something I've been looking for for quite a while.  My father has a cat who has managed to destroy every charger cord he's had so being able to retract the cord and make it invisible will keep his paws off of this one! Chargers I've owned in the past always seem loose, either at the USB plug or at the phone plus but this one is very secure which helps ensure a complete charge.  The charging speed is comparable to the original cord we were given with the phone, not slower as I've seen with other cords.  Overall I'm very happy with this purchase!<br />I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review"
1,"The case has plenty of protection, and looks sleek. It slides out of pockets easily without pulling the fabric upwards. Since I put this case on about a month ago my phone has taken some serious tumbles and has come out unharmed.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the interior gray plastic flexible case is a little bit loose, especially around the bottom of the phone by the button. The thin strip of rubber there wiggles around a bit and there's a gap between the rubber and the plastic. I've just been kind of stuffing the rubbery part under the plastic and it's worked fine."
0,"It's working good and like the idea of Bluetooth, thank you for a good product."
-1,This product seems to have more interference then the transmitter I had for my old I phone 4.
1,EXCELLENT SERVICE GREAT
1,nicely made -
1,Great
1,"I bought this for my son about 4 months ago. Verus reached out today, making sure that we liked the product and asking us to write a review. Although we haven't needed customer service, it appears they genuinely want to supply a great product. My son loves the case. He has used it every day for the past 4 months. It shows minimal wear. His only concern is that if he every lost the compartment cover, his case would look awful. Of course this has not happened. In fact, he says that the cover has not come off by accident a single time over the past 4 months. It look very nice and doesn't add much bulk to the phone, even with the secret compartment. I do not hesitate to recommend this case to anyone with an S6."
-1,"Bought this as a replacement for my s5, it stopped working two months later, they did not want to replace this for me. Very disappointed. If an item is defected, it should be automatically  replaced regardless  of how many days passed since tou bought it. Do yourselves  a favor a DONT waste youre money.  Get it from youre phone providers store. Thank you<br />Ps. I would give it ZERO stars if possible"
1,Great item.<br />Very sturdy feel to it.<br />Has charged IPhone S5 and Samsung S6 at the same time with out any problems.
1,"I love it. San Antonio is a hands free city, now."
1,"Works great, simultaneously charges a Google Nexus 4 and an ASUS tablet. On a personal note, I also like the blue light."
1,Perfect
-1,The case seemed to have been protective but I guess I droped it one to many times & not only did the case break my screen us also broken I would not recommend this product fir someone who always drops their phone or anything else for that matter
1,Perfec
-1,never got any parts to go with the gps what good is it with out parts
1,This is an easy to put on and remove phone case for the HTC Desire 626. My wife loves the purple color and the sparkly rhinestones. It has a nice lip to protect the screen and the soft-touch rubber is very non-slip.
1,They were great for the price.
1,"One week after purchasing this case for my NEW phone, I left the phone on the top of my car and drove off!  Hours later my son received a call from my phone when it was found.  Not a SCRATCH on the case or phone!  Couldn't have asked for a better outcome!"
1,Product fits phone. Want to try for other colours. Coloured cases are popular now.
1,It works so good
1,Easy to install and very good protection. No glare  from it either.
1,"I'm trying hard to improve my fitness levels and this is really helping! It's a great prompt during the day to encourage me to be more active. The motivational messages such as 'you will have walked 72 miles in your first month' start to put your effort into real context and spur you on!<br />For me though the most life changing feature has to be the sleep alarm. I am most definitely not a morning person. I struggle to wake at a regular time and I am avoided by people in our house as my sunny nature does not surface until around 9am! I started using the band after a holiday to the U.S. and jet lag is always a HUGE issue for me. However, I set the band to wake me during the light sleep phase 10 mins before my usual alarm. It has made the most amazing difference - I've conquered jet lag without any problems, I'm waking at a consistent time each day and I'm actually able to get up and function like a pleasant human being! I feel almost evangelical about the difference it has made to my sleeping habits.<br />I highly recommend the UP24! P"
0,Case is fair. Had it three days and already it is fraying and losing it's color on edge that sits on table.
0,"Bought two of these and liked them initially.  The phone clamp worked well on my Samsung Avant w/ a thick protective case.  It held my phone securely horizontally and vertically.  The base stuck directly to the dash of my 06 4Runner and 05 Odyssey and was secure for about 3 days.  However, after a few days in the hot sun, the base lost suction and kept falling off.  I tried washing the suction cup and my dash per the instructions, but the base would only hold for a few hours.  Could never get it to stick like original again.  I'm guessing the hot sun baked the gooey-ness out of the suction cup."
1,Two things that I always need for my iPhone - a protective case and a charging cable. This case makes sure that I have both with me at all times. Pretty ingenious - the cable fits right in the case kickstand. Cool thing is that this cable is also quality - not just a cheap piece of *&#^. Highly recommended.
1,"I read several reviews before purchasing this case. This is everything i expected fits like a glove and was easy to put on phone, i don't think it took me 3 minute to put it on phone."
1,Ordered this case for my phone and very happy with the product....will order again from this company. ....
1,"Very easy to install and clearly wont peel or bubble any time soon! Highly recommended, and fits inside Zagg Arsenal case."
1,works good
0,"I would say the guard dog iPhone case is average.  The silicone layer is easy to put on as well as  the outer case. I don’t particularly like the feel of the outer case...it is slick and the plastic outer case looks and feels rather cheap. If you want to add a little “oomph” to your case, it’s nice that you can have the hard outer layer as one color and the silicone inner liner as another.  Other companies offer cases which offer more substantial protection. .  but do you really need it?  It all depends upon your use and how “accident prone” you are. ;-)  For the current price, and for a “basic” case. . . This isn’t bad."
1,Works very well for Droid Maxx phone.  I like the &#34;kickstand&#34; part of case.  Get a alot of comments on that feature.
0,The order processed quickly and it was received quickly but I couldn't get it to work with my phone. I was able to hear when making a call but no one was able to hear me. I worked with it for a while before just determining that it just wouldn't work with my phone. Nice headset though!
1,Exelente
1,Saves a lot of plug-in space on vacation!
1,"Awesome way to keep your cell phone safe while riding your bike!<br /><br />This is the only cell phone case for my bike which hasn't broke!! I bought two other types, and both of them broke after only a few weeks.<br /><br />This one uses rubber, and it absorbs the vibrations much better.  This thing is a MUST-HAVE if you ride your bike long distance, or it occasionally drizzles on your ride.  This will keep your phone remarkably dry during a rain, even though it's not 100% waterproof!<br /><br />Great buy!"
0,The slots inside for credit card was ripped and the outside is just plastic. Just kept it so I don't have to spend time returning
1,"I have had very good experience with this product, great performance, easy handling, ideal for me. high quality design!"
-1,Not the most durable that's for sure.  The medal around it is thin and bends out of shape easily.
-1,"Was purchased as a Christmas give. What a piece of junk...when it was opened on Christmas it looked great. When it was activated 2 days later, it showered why it was &#34;used&#34;. Junk is junk. Waisted my money on that one."
0,"It works ok - can't expect too much at the price. I have it set on my nightstand for overnight charging - pretty much every night I need to unplug/re-plug it in before it will charge. Not a big deal, but kind of a pain.  It become a bigger pain if phone has decent charge to being with; it will then charge to 100%, but once battery starts to go down again, it will not re-start charging without being reset. This causes me to often start the day with 70-80% charge."
1,World's great
1,so happy to find something that fits my blu win hd. It matches my phone and the material both the yellow silicone and grey plastic are soft to the touch. I would say that using this case is a pleasant tactile experience.
1,Its a good offer
1,"The cover is good-enough for my wife's HTC Desire 626, but it wasn't exactly what she wanted. The feel of the back cover was a little too smooth and the whole case was darker than she thought it would be. But it fit nicely and I would have been happy with it."
1,"Yes, I received it.  Thanks"
1,Like it
1,"I purchased the Snapfon ezTWO phone for my 84 year old Mother who has lost most of her vision from macular degeneration.  I wanted her to be able to get to her 3 kids on &#34;speed dial&#34; from her rehab facility and the audio feature is perfect for this purpose.  To call me she presses &#34;2&#34; on the nice big buttons and the phone says aloud &#34;two&#34; and then speed dials my number.  I got it for a great price ($79) and it arrived promptly and in good condition.<br /><br />There are two reasons for not giving this phone a full 5 stars:<br /><br />1.  Setting up speed dial was not straightforward.  The directions did not explain how to set up speed dial and Google was not immediately helpful.  It took me an hour but I finally did find the instructions on Google - the speed dial feature is located in &#34;settings&#34; and after I found it the rest was straightforward.<br /><br />2.  I've only had one conversation with Mom on this phone (it with me as the caller, making a test call) and although I heard her loud and clear (the volume is also excellent for folks with hearing loss), she kept saying, &#34;Your voice keeps cutting out.&#34;  I'll need to test this out a bit more.  I've got the phone all set up now and am about to send it to her in the rehab hospital where she will be for about 2 more months.<br /><br />Other phones with similar features cost up to $900! I found 1 phone with similar features at $59 but it didn't have very good reviews.  So far I am very pleased with this purchase.  I went to AT&T and got a $30/mo no contract plan and am happy with that too."
1,super helpful
1,Big screen great details when entering or exiting the highway.  You don't need trip planners if you run the road a lot. I've heard negative things about the GPS units with the trip planning elements.  Learn to read a map and don't ever truly trust any GPS units with all aspects of traveling.  Great product for the price
1,Excellent product. The mesh baggie is a great addition.
1,"easy to put on, sturdy, durable case"
-1,"Does not work, it makes my battery terribly hot & does not charge very well, plus, you cannot use your regular phone cases"
1,Boyfriend loves it
1,Grandson loves cover for phone.  Works well.
1,Dope!
0,Delivered as promised but have not had it long enough to see how well it works or for how long
1,This is a great product!<br />i had 4 other powerbanks and they we'r not as good as this!<br />Charges fast and has a lot of power. also small and comfortable . fast shipping too.<br />Im very happy with it.
1,so far 1 month..very good
0,Difficult to clean. Great otherwise.
1,I bought it and took on vacation to Europe and this Power Bank performed great. We not only able to charge two devices at the same time but charge at much higher speed than standard charger.  It was a pleasant bonus I was not aware about it. It was also very convenient to charge it “on the road” when you are driving. Overall greatly deserved 5 stars
1,"Love this!! Great product, just what I needed"
-1,VERY BAD I USE IT ONLY 2 WEEKS
1,"I don't usually leave reviews but I have to say this is THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CASE I'VE EVER BOUGHT! I much prefer to not have a case on my phone because they're either bulky and ugly or showy and don't protect. This case is slim AND gorgeous. I have no doubt it will protect my phone from nicks if I drop it. It's smooth but not slippery and the design is perfect. My only, Bengal complaint is that the outside lining tends to separate a bit from the inside design.. Maybe it's just the one I got... If they want to send me a free replacement I'd change it to 5 stars and be. A costumer for life! Haha."
1,"It states 10,000 mAH....... In all honesty it's more like 6,500-7,000 mAH.<br /><br />But still a good product for the price of $13.99.<br /><br />My main concern is how long this product might last. I hope it gives me at least 1 1/2 years of life. Only time will tell.<br /><br />My rating is as follows:<br />5 stars for the price<br />3 stars for the product<br /><br />Giving it an overall rating of 4 stars.<br /><br />If anything changes in the upcoming months I'll update my review."
1,The colors are vibrant and easy to see in my purse.
1,Good case so far so good
-1,Loved the watch until the back of it chipped where the battery charger connected. They cannot repair the crack except replace the whole watch and re-charge a cost that actually is more than what I paid originally.<br />Customer service was also non-existent so made the process worse.<br />Sad to say it was great for a few months.....
1,Nice case very tough I would recommend it
1,Nice case. Fit well.
1,"Apparently they redid the installation process, so it was really easy to install.  Seems like a good product, but I guess I won't know for sure until I drop my phone."
1,"Item as described , fast delivery"
1,Really good product and has good instruction
-1,"Its ok, though it would be a little more rugged"
-1,Not happy to small and not shown like it does in the picture
1,This is my first portable charger. So far it's good.<br />Bought since the Anker products are great.
1,"Really solid, well built case.  Feels extremely well made provides a lot of protection for the device."
-1,"The electronic equipment working only for 4 days, is of very poor quality. No recommend"
1,Pretty good replacement for worn out Samsung S5 battery.
1,This subwoofer works very well. It sounds amazing. My Vette now is rocking!!!!<br />Excellent customer service and fast shipping!!!!
1,Love the fun pattern. The case has proven extremely sturdy considering the abuse it has received from my young children getting a hold of my phone.
1,I was very pleased with the products and the fast delivery speed.
1,"Love this case, super girly just like me!!  Great customer service from KoKo cases with amazing shipping time. Great company, will definitely purchase from KoKo again!  Thanks!!"
-1,"For Samsung T899 T-Mobile , simply does not work. No audio, no cel signal. Returned."
1,goid
1,Excellent Thank You..
1,Great to be ably to charge multiple items at once.  Great price and delivery.
-1,Well you get what you pay for here. I wear mine on my belt but it kept jumping off my belt because the metal clip was not very secure. I ran my belt through the webbing behind the metal clip and the webbibg is tearing and starting to separate from the case. Spend a little more and get something better. A stingy man pays twice
1,"It does get switched off sometimes, but overall a good product"
-1,"Looks super cheap, and doesn't protect the phone. You get what you pay for."
1,Super cute case just lost a few stones after a few months of use. not bad as I am hard on phones.
1,"Love this charger cable! Charges my IPhone 6+ super fast. Durable cord, doesn't tangle. I have one that stays in my car and two in my house. Definitely a good buy!"
1,Excellent!!!!
1,"Loved the item and got a plethora of compliments on it. Only issue is that it did not last; after about 2-3 drops the case started to crack and break. Which gave me a sad face cause I loved the case and style. I had to go back to the Duro case I bought 2 years ago which I have dropped more time than I can count and it's still trucking! However, if you want compliments and love retro Nintendo, this is a great case; just be sure to take care of it and not drop it."
1,Bought 2 pair and they loved them
1,Simplistic and effective! A definite purchase!
-1,"Piece of junk.  Apps crash.  Bad photos.  Can't send a text with a photo.  The first version was 100% better,  Big disappointment, I won't be keeping this long."
1,This is a perfect replacement for my camera lens on the iPhone 9. I got the silver and the color matches perfectly. The lens cover is well made and and is a perfect replacement. The glass is very clear and once installed you can not even tell it was not the one that came on the iPhone 6.<br /><br />So people know this takes a little work that most people may not want to do themselves. You will need to remove the back cover of the phone which is not that easy to do and it can break really easy. Watch this video before you attempt to replace the lens cover on you iPhone 6:<br />[...]. It can be done but takes some time and a lot of patience. I was able to replace mine but it took me about 30 minutes.
1,Just started using it but like that I can charge one battery while using the other
0,This is a great case if you only want to use it for a few months. beautiful design and the ability to put cards in it is awesome. Then the blaring problem comes into view. the case does not last. the tab to hold the case broke of multiple crack lines throughout the outside cover. the only part that has lasted is the inner rubber piece that holds the phone. The only thing that holds that rubber piece in is some sticky type substance and when it pulls dirt and other stuff get onto the stickiness and causes the rubber piece to never stick to that section again. the outside cover was in such bad shape that I just ended up ripping the outside off and just using the inside rubber piece to protect my phone. In total if you looking for a temporary case this is great for you but if you want one to one look somewhere else this is not the case for you.
-1,Leaves a residue/glue from the sticker tabs after you apply the protector in the corner of my screen. Trying to remove it is nearly impossible.  :(...
0,I've been having problems with people understanding me ever since I put the cover on.  Don't think it's an efficient case for the microphone.
0,This case was exactly what I was looking for but sadly it did not fit my Asus eeepad transformer. What I paid for it is not worth the return shipping costs.
1,Nice screen protectors at a great price
1,I cannot get my Bluetooth to pair with my phone. I have called Sony tech support and they do not deal with Sony Ericsson products anymore. The radio works fine.
-1,"PHONE only worked two days, then off and more work. REQUIRE REQUEST FOR THE PRODUCT WARRANTY."
1,Nice case
0,Nice but the case is hard and hurts your pinky finger when texting
-1,"This worked great for about 2 weeks and then out of the blue it just stopped charging altogether.  Very disappointed as I was<br />so happy to have found a long cord, it's a shame it wasn't reliable or sturdy to last longer than days.  I will be returning this item."
0,to small for the iphone 5
-1,Prongs broke on day three so won't charge phone
1,Phillips head stripped out the screws holding the led in place.  All the other tools worked well.  Would definitely recommend over tools included in replacement glass kit.
1,"This is a great tempered glass screeen.  Installation is straight forward and simple if followed correctly.  I have had no issue with it shipping or cracking and it looks and feels like there is nothing covering my screen.  I highly recommend for anyone with a OnePlus One to get this glass protector, you wont be disappointed."
1,Great product and fast delivery. Works great!
1,This case is very sleek.. Met my expectation !!
-1,Sucks!!!!!!
1,Real handy to charge multiple phones when travelling as a family. Functional and appealing design
1,"Great gadget to have. I was able to take pictures of 4 of us, husband and 2 kids all together. I usually the one missing in action, the &#34;photographer&#34;. All the pictures of vacations and fun times as a family, it was always my hubby and kids. Now I can join in. it folds small and fits in my purse, backpack. Sturdy and great quality for the price."
1,Works as listed....even fits my Mini Cooper S round vents...magnet strong enough to hold iPhone 6 Plus with Otter Box Defender case!
-1,Kept falling out of my phone and running down my battery. Even with it in my phone thought the s pen was detached
-1,"I'm using this remote to control a DNX572BH (2015 Kenwood lineup).  Functionality is incredibly lacking compared to an older KVT719DVD (2007 Kenwood lineup) unit and remote that I have.  With my old unit and remote I can press 1 on the remote and it will take me to my radio preset number 1.  The new one, nope...On my old unit, while playing MP3, bluetooth, or any other media type, I can press next on the remote and it will move forward to the next track; my new one?  Nope.  All I can do with this remote is change the volume and scroll through radio stations. Apparently technology has regressed since 2007.  I am pissed off that I bought this remote and I'm wondering what the difference is between this remote that has been discontinued and the much pricier remote with the same model # that is still active."
1,"I live in Venezuela, the phone works well with movistar and movillnet. I am very pleased with my purchase, easy to use and supports all applications I have installed. Really great and the best value."
1,Great for every day use
-1,The color was so faded and broke after I put it on. Would never buy again
1,"great product, durable"
1,"perfect fit for my android phone,great price.Fits security of my belt .Easy to get out of case and snap back in,like it a lot.I have seen people bend over and their smart phones fall from their shirt pocket,hit the floor ,not a good thing.With this case you will not have that problem.Also does not scratch screen."
-1,"Well, after using this for a short time, I thought I liked it, but as it turns out, the case gets quite hot (only when when I had the case charging, not connected to an external charger), and it has caused the battery to swell up, lifting the screen off of the phone.  I would include a picture, but it's difficult to take a pic of your phone when it's your only camera.  Now I have to spend about $50 to get the battery replaced.  That's what I get for trying to save some money and not buying a brand I know and trust."
-1,Didn't like it looks different from the image
-1,I hate this thing. I really wasted my money. It does not track well. It has a hard time connecting to the app to sync everything. They think they gonna get me to pay $12 a month? Sike!
1,Love the case. Color is spot on
-1,"The tracking is great, app is great. It actually does track sleep and recognizes when you are active. The problem is the design is poor. I have had my up since June and lost it at least once a week. The first week I lost it at work. As a nurse I naturally went through all the dirty linen (yep!) on our unit and found it! After thorough sanitation it was back in my wrist where it belonged. Naturally I blamed myself, maybe I didn't have it fitted properly. Nope.  Ya'll this thing falls off all the time. I have found it between my car seats, in my dogs bed, in the bathtub, in my bed, in my pool.... The list goes on.  Well, until yesterday that is. It is most definitely nowhere to be found. So bottom line, you pay that much it needs to be secure. It works great, when you know where it is."
-1,The phone case was for the model but way to small for the phone.
1,"I have said this before and I will say it again, you can never have enough selfie sticks because a family member or friend will always try to &#34;borrow&#34; it. This selfie stick is awesome because it can be used using your headphone jack or with Bluetooth. You do have to charge it when you get it. I like that it comes with a waterproof carrying bag and I won't have to worry about it gettting damaged if I'm walking in the rain with it. Its small enough to fit in a purse and come on girls we all need one in our purse. The only problem I had with it was that I had a hard time trying to extend it. Other than that it didn't have any other issues and worked really good.<br />*I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
1,"I've used this panel quite a bit now, charging several different devices in several different conditions, and I'm very impressed, for the most part, with its performance. Measuring power output with an in-line USB multimeter showed I was able to squeeze between 8 & 9 watts from it in full sunlight. That's pretty close to its theoretical maximum output of 10 watts from one USB port, (The panel may be rated up to 14 watts, but 10 watts (2 amps x 5 volts) is the most you could possibly get from a single USB port.) and quite comparable to the 2 amp USB wall charger I used as a control. In short, this panel will charge your device just about as fast as most wall chargers--in direct sunlight.<br /><br />Every solar panel's Achilles heel has always been a precipitous drop in power output in cloudy conditions, and the Anker panel is no different. It uses mono-crystalline solar cells, which historically perform better than polycrystalline cells in cloudy conditions. Still, I notice that the power output would often drop to 2 watts or below in anything less than direct sunlight. In stormy conditions, output would drop into the milliwatt range, 250 mw or below. This is still enough juice to trickle-charge most devices, but it will definitely extend the charge time of more power-hungry devices by a matter of several hours. This problem is certainly not unique to the Anker panel, though. Just be aware that, in cloudy weather, you likely won't be charging any large, power-hungry tablets with it.<br /><br />Build quality is very good, from what I could tell. The panels are surrounded in a pretty tough-feeling canvas fabric & held shut by a thick strip of velcro. It has four metal O-rings on Its perimeter, and the USB connections are shrouded inside a pocket which also serves as a convenient place to store your device. The USB ports themselves seem kind of flimsy & loose though, and they don't include a cover to keep debris out when they're not in use. I'd highly recommend keepingthis thing off the ground as much as possible. It's a bit bulky and heavy for the ultra-light backpacking crowd, but then again, I could see this thing easily recharging digital cameras, walkie-talkies, GPS units, smart phones, head lamps and the like, and saving a ton of batteries in the process.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have about this panel is that the box which houses the DC-DC converter and the USB ports gets really hot while in use. This isn't just due to solar heating, as the rest of the panel doesn't get nearly as hot, even after spending several hours in direct sunlight. This has me a little concerned about the longevity of the panel's DC-DC converter. Here's hoping Anker did their homework & designed it to hack high temperatures for hours at a time.<br /><br />One last note: I bought this panel along with Anker's own 16000 mAh Li-Ion battery. [[ASIN:B00N2T7U90 Anker 2nd Gen Astro E5 16000mAh Portable Charger  External Battery Power Bank with PowerIQ Technology 2-Port 3A for iPhone 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 4S, iPad Air, mini, Galaxy S6 S5 S4 S3, Note 4 3 2, Tab 4 3 2 Pro, Nexus 4 5 7 10, HTC One, One 2 (M8), LG G3, MOTO X G, most other Phones and Tablets (Black).]]<br />I found that this battery will stop charging when its input current drops below a set point, and it won't resume charging until it has been physically disconnected and reconnected to its power source. Anker's customer support has confirmed this to be an issue with this specific battery. At this time, I'd recommend going with a different battery, as this one is essentially incompatible with any kind of solar charging, due to this flaw."
1,nice product.
1,"This has saved my phone from a broken screen a few times. The protector cracked, but my screen was spared."
-1,"I purchased this to replace a one year old S4 case.  I figure a year is pretty good based on my phone usage.  I received this case and attempted to carefully install it.  After several attempts to fit the rigid outer shell over the flexible inner liner, it broke unexpectedly at the volume control / edge of screen location.  The flexible inner liner is slightly too small to fit well and the outer liner is brittle compared to the Spigen case I was replacing."
1,Great product. Easy ans simple instructions ships super fast<br /> Would recommend this product to.anyone..Great job!!
1,perfect fit and build quality.  shows off the beauty of a great phone.
-1,Did not work from day one.  Threw them in the garbage
1,"Works great! It's designed to fit well over the phone and has excellent protection all around, it prevents my phone from water and dirt and doesn't affect my phone usage so overall great product. A unique design, thank to seller!"
1,excellent product!
1,I love this case! Feels very sturdy and after a few drops (thank you clumsiness) the case holds up!<br />No scratches to the phone or case!<br />Good buy!
1,Makes my laptop tolerable!
1,A great fun phone case and conversation piece. Kids love it
1,"Very quick shipping and works great. Has a few different options like a radio and bluetooth. It does have an option to charge as you ride if you have a cigarette lighter port. The batteries do last a good while on a charge though. I have a windshield on my bike, and you can't really hear it going down the interstate, but riding through town it does well. As long as I am under 50 MPH I can hear it. I bought it mainly because it required no wiring, so I figured it would not be too loud. It did sit out through a heavy rainstorm, and still plays just fine. It came with two ways to quickly attach it."
-1,Stopped working 3 months after I bought it.
1,Definitely one of the best cases I've used. It fits very snug around the phone and protects it very well. Would recommend
1,The Anker charging unit is perfect fit to fix our problem at home for lack of UBS ports for charging our smart gadgets.
-1,It was OK from a price point there's nothing that can compare. The battery is pretty great and has useful specs. I did have some trouble with att network.<br /><br />UPDATE: after 2 1/2 months the earpiece stopped working.
-1,"Received the order, installed on watch and it would not close correctly unable to close one of the clips. Lost the cover, threw away"
1,Works well. Doesn't get too hot.
-1,"Great idea, although I haven't been able to get it to work properly only (2) or (3) times!"
-1,Mic did not work.
1,Loves this case
1,I love my phone case
1,Using it to hold my iPhone 6 with silicone casing on a BMW R Nine T handlebar.<br />Easy to mount and versatile when it comes to orientation: can use the iPhone as GPS or action cam both in portrait and landscape modes. Easy to set even with riding gloves.<br />Holds iPhone 6 perfectly up to legal speeds including on highways.
-1,"Case didn't fit and, yes, I ordered the correct one. Contacted seller to return. Never got a reply."
0,Can't wait to get it for my galaxy s3
0,"Well... i was very excited to get my case and once i got it out of the box i was disappointed that it wasnt the same color as the picture shows. The picture is a lighter black, more like a gray color and the purple is brighter. Well my case is dark black and dark purple... also my stylus is black not purple like the picture. Im hoping its because im in a dark room. I like how the buttons are easy to push and i like how it fits my phone. For the most part it seems to be like my old otterbox, maybe a little cheaper made but as of now it works fine. Also the kickstand is really hard to open."
-1,"Not wrth 1,star. Didn't fit phone. FALSE ADVERTISING"
1,I like this case a lot.  I had the Defender's case but it was too bulky.  This is much easier to carry around.  Thank you.
1,"A bit bulky, but works as expected...also the key pocket is very small..."
1,"Perfect. I charged my tablet, phone and Bluetooth box and still have over 50 percent charge..."
1,"Love it! I have all kinds of disc issues, slipped, herniated, degenerative, you name it. This is helping me improve my posture. I have it set to 10 seconds. I see my pain specialist today, so we'll see what he says."
1,amazing. fits perfect
1,I bought Two of the TUDIA Ultra Slim Full Matte Cases a Black & a Blue the Blue is tuff Looking But if You have a Screen Protector it will push agents it and make bubble on the edges they are  Great Cases well made.
1,Loved the fit & color
1,Great little bluetooth speaker
-1,This case is a fake.  And a VERY poor one at that.
-1,ill get a blue light flashing after a couple weeks and then its done
1,Had this cable for 9 months and it gave me an error message.  Spoke to the seller and they we awesome and are issuing a replacement cable.  I have a few of these and am overall very happy with the product and especially appreciate their customer service follow through.
-1,"I followed the directions precisely. Cleaned the case with the alcohol pad provided and let it dry thoroughly. Peeled the liner from the adhesive and pressed the adapter to the case and held it with constant pressure for 30 seconds, flipped it over and held it for another 30 seconds, then let it dry for more than 24 hours before using. Then the first time I used the belt clip the adhesive let loose and my phone went clattering to the floor. I called lifeproof and they are going to send me a replacement adapter. If the first adhesive didn't hold then why should I trust the replacement?"
1,"I love the products, i actually get exactly want i wanted"
-1,The case is nice and all but it doesnt show the apple when on. And the screen protector was also bigger than my actual screen. Im keeping it for now but will most likely get another one soon
1,Great product very happy
1,These are great!  This is my second set.
1,Great iphone cover love it !!
1,"Case is amazing.  Needed a case quickly as the iPhone was already dropped and need glass replaced, very happy with look and feel of the case.  Item was shipped and in perfect condition.  will most likely look for more items from this seller :)"
1,excellent product.  much more durable than the rubber/plastic units.
1,Great
-1,"After less than three months my phone did not work. Sent it back to be fixed and they said they mailed it back to me 10 days ago, did not provide tracking information and refuse to respond to any emails. Not worth the money, I am trying to return the item for a refund for horrible customer service and a defective device. The device was overheating, would not hold a charge and after a few months I couldnt get service and my provider could not reset the APN's."
1,Don't settle for a cheap charger.  This one will charge quickly and reliably.  It's a little difficult to remove but you won't need to unless you're switching cars all the time.  I was done using chargers that worked for a month.  Spend a little more to get a lot.
0,"Maybe I haven't figured out how to install it but doesn't seem to fit properly.  If it did, I would really like it--even so, I have dropped my phone a couple times and it does protect it."
1,Fit perfect and functioned just as the original. Very pleased.
1,"Very durable on the outside, inside vinyl works fine!  Great value for the price!"
1,very good product
1,love it!
1,excelent
-1,"This is a very good GPS unit, however it had some navigation issues and caused me headaches in places that had a lot of traffic so I have to give it 2 stars.<br /><br />The GPS took a very, very long time to download the initial update, it was not 8 hours, but it was at least 3-4 hours. You also have to connect it to a computer, it cannot download the updates over wifi. I did not have any trouble with this process at all.<br /><br />Some states you cannot attach this unit or anything to your windshield,, since the device comes with a windshield mount, so you have to be careful if you are driving through a state with this restriction as I am sure it would be an instant ticket from the police.<br /><br />The highway navigation on this GPS unit is very good, it is very precise, and plenty of time is given to make a lane change. This I definitely a feature I appreciate.<br /><br />If you are trying to find anything off a highway then the GPS would excel at this, if your destination is just off a highway or relatively close to one. I took a trip to an area that I do not know too well with the plan on relying on this GPS to get me around safely. Since there is a lot of traffic in this area (and just about every other area that is a major city in the USA) it fails at navigating safely through high traffic residential and commercial neighborhoods. I would expect that a GPS unit would be able to navigate me correctly and safely wherever I go in the USA, but this one kind of fails at that.<br /><br />It does not tell you whether to go right or left out of a parking lot to get to your next destination. If you are shopping or going to an amusement park you have to guess whether you need to go right or left out of the parking lot to get to your next destination.<br /><br />Instead of telling me to go left out of a parking lot of a shopping plaza instead it told me to make a U-turn around a busy intersection, this caused me to get stuck in a snafu of traffic and cause a holdup because the GPS was not working right and it almost got me killed! I am not even sure if it was a legal turn, that could have lead to even more problems. It also sent me in circles down streets that I did not need to go down. Instead it could have just told me to turn left out of the parking lot and I would have reached my next stop much faster without causing a traffic holdup or snafu.<br /><br />It also tried to tell me to make a right turn down a street that clearly was not a street that you could make a right turn on, since there was no possible way to make a right turn on this street. Again, another traffic snafu, if it would have just told me to go down a different street or just to go straight this would not have been a problem.<br /><br />It does show street names and locations which is extremely helpful, the spoken voice is not a problem to understand at all. Showing the street names and location is helpful because sometimes signs are torn down or are unreadable, its also helpful to show the exact location of each street, so you know, in 3 intersections you have to turn here. This prevents going down the wrong street. This is a great feature and its very, very accurate.<br /><br />If you are looking for a museum or amusement park or some place where the entrance may not be too obvious then this GPS might not do that well with it, we missed the entrance to a museum because we didn't really know where it was, and it was not clearly labeled in an easy to find way. It wasn't too bad because we were able to turn around and go back in. The GPS just tells you &#34;arriving at x location&#34; it doesn't show you exactly where the entrance is.<br /><br />I also had to navigate several roundabouts to get to one of my destinations, and this GPS did surprisingly well with this, then again I was in a slightly more rural area and there wasn't a lot of traffic around. But it outlined exactly where to go on the maps so I did not make a wrong turn, without the GPS doing that,I do not think I would have made it to my destination without several wrong turns as the roundabouts were very confusing, and there was at least 5-6 of them.I do not think I would have made it to my destination without several wrong turns as the roundabouts were very confusing, and there was at least 5-6 of them."
-1,"After a few months, it stopped holding it's charge, so I went back to my old, more dependable GPS."
-1,case is slightly to small hard to get phone in and out. i've only had this about a month and the case is already ripping. not very happy
1,Works very well
1,I got a lot of compliments
1,"I am impressed with the sound coming from this pair of Rio S earbuds:  Very nicely balanced; rich, yet lively sound; full and all-around sound like you are sitting right there in the same room as the performance.  Not an iota of sibilance to be heard.<br /><br />The longer you listen, the better they sound.  So give them their opportunity to break in.  Easy to listen to for hours, too--they are very comfortable.  For a budding audiophile, you absolutely cannot go wrong with these.<br /><br />The sound engineers have given the bass plenty of room to work its magic.  And vocals are very lifelike.  I hear much depth with solo singers, both male and female.  I hear that tiny touch of tinniness that I'm used to with a few of my favorite rock band vocals.<br /><br />Instruments sound really great:  Strings, guitar, reeds, accordion.  Horns are really wonderful.  Piano even more wonderful.<br /><br />Mic feature works fine.<br /><br />Comes with three sets of different sized ear tips, so you can get the perfect fit.  Fit is very important to your listening experience:  Don't be afraid to mix sizes.  Personally I need one large and one medium.  It would have been nice to see a set of Comply ear tips in this package.  If you are comparing this set to others in this price range, you will find some with an extra pair of Comply tips enclosed.  It is a plus.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the flat cable has a little too much memory and I can never get it to lose its waves.<br /><br />*I received a free sample product from Noontec."
1,"Very pleased with the Benuo iPhone case.  Good quality leather, well made and just what I wanted."
-1,Has about a 6 inch range. Useless.
1,If it was possible to give more than 5 stars I would have. I have always liked Plantronics headsets but this is the best one yet. The range is great and the sound quality is amazing. I would truly recommend to a friend.
-1,"looks like an iphone otterbox, but doesn't fit at all.  we had to tweek it to get it to fit. wouldn't buy it again."
1,This is a great speaker! Bought it for the golf course and it works perfect. Good sound from this tiny speaker! I have already recommended it to several other people!
1,This is the most amazing phone case ! My husband works in contraction and has dropped this phone sooo many times and the phone just bounces protecting the phone it's the material of what the phone is made of its amazing! I really recommend give it a try!
0,great extension cable just wish it was a little more durable!
1,Have dropped my iPhone multiple times and have had no cracking or issues. Looks nice on my phone; can still see the gold coloring of the iPhone through the case.
1,"Works great for perk t.v, I have bought 5 of this phone and they only crash from time to time, and I have made 20$ in 2 weeks using them for this purpose, that's close to 50$ a month so they will pay for themselves in 2 months."
1,work well
1,The Zilu Smart Power external battery is a cheap external battery the works very well if you need to charge your device once. It has a full 2 amp outport USB so it charges your phone faster (if you have a phone the can handle 2Amps if not it will use a lower amount.) This external battery also includes smart technology that will detect if your phone is fully charged. The only major issue that I highly is the way the indicator lights shows the charge. If you have the device up right the indicator lights goes bottom to top. But thats not that big of and issue to cause someone not to buy the external battery. You can also get the external battery in different colors. I would really recommend this external battery if you want a small external battery for traveling.<br /><br />&#34;I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation”
1,"This case so far has been great for my phone. The owl design is extremely cute and it looks great on my phone. However, I do agree with the other reviews saying it is hard to get on. I didn't have too many problems getting it on my phone, but after trying to take the case off my phone (thinking that I had put it on the wrong way) I could not get it off. I tried using a pen which didn't work, but after reading a review about scissors I may have to try that. I think this case is very durable and keeps my phone safe, but it is extremely difficult to get off your phone. I would recommend it, but with caution."
1,Excellent case for my ipad mini. Awesome design and protection.
1,It's cute this is my second one just try not to set it and take good care of it
1,Good quality
1,"I like my new case from #Ghostek it is pretty💣since Lifeproof wanna bullcrap on making a Fr&egrave; for the 6 plus. I'm not fond of their Nu&uacute;d case but I am VERY fond of this Ghostek case, I submerged this case in water and there was NO WATER AT ALL inside of it!! I got this case and am very glad that I made the purchase while getting qualified for the Amazon.com Chase credit card with $1,000 credit limit & $200 cash advance didn't hurt neither😉fyi: I have a GLASS HD screen protector by Amzer on underneath the plastic screen protector that is on the case & my phone works fine with NO problems at all. It's very CLEAR while viewing & still easy to use the touchscreen. I wish that the case would have come EXACTLY as advertised with only 2 holes in the front but it has 3 & the extra hole at the top isn't needed because the phone only has 2 holes in the front on the screen. That's my only issue with it so that's why I gave it 4⭐️instead of 5 because the picture is false advertising in my eyes because I expected to have the EXACT same front for my screen. I called my son and he said I sounded muffled a little bit but it's barely noticeable so we switched phones and I didn't hear anything, maybe I need a hearing aid, so I'll just wait until someone else calls me and tells me I sound weird or something to comeback and do an update for that part of the phone. I like how my phone is completely covered it is not a piece of my phone uncovered and I like that ALOT!! It's like my Zero Lemon case but waterproof with a plastic screen protector on top of my Amzer tempered glass screen protector. #Ghostek #Apple #iPhone6Plus"
1,I love the case. Also it came a day early so yay(:
1,"I Love The Case, It Came Like A Week Earlier So That Was Great"
-1,"Terrible. Way to big for even the LG G4 with an otterbox attached. To make matters worse, the opening has no method of closing so that when you're running your phone or whatever else you have in there could fly out at any second."
1,I got these to try out this technology.  They were well worth the cost and I think they will hold up well.
1,fits better than the original one that came with my watch
1,I like it
-1,Dead on arrival.
1,"Great product, awesome price, fits lots of cards, license insurance etc plus you could throw some paper money in there also."
0,Used to hook up antenna from kenwood deck to 2000 silverado. Part was very loose fitting and had a tendency to wanna slip off while installing deck. Antenna adapter serves it's purpose.
1,I thought I had reviewed this already but I must have failed to press submit. In any event this is a great product. If I can apply this correctly anyone can. I watched the instructional video first. Then I followed the instructions to the letter. The only change I made is that I applied so much of the solution the shield was more than dripping. Once I positioned the screen I waited about 40 minutes for the sides to become sticky. I had to do this because I had overdone the solution. Then I patiently smoothed down the sides. I was very surprised at how good it looked and covered the COMPLETE screen. Then I went for a bicycle ride. I know I was supposed to wait overnight but what the hey? No lift...no problems. After the ride I let the watch dry overnight and the last couple of bubbles dissipated. GREAT product!
1,"Excellent product. Great Sound. I bought it so that I could have something in the shower to answer the phone, listen to music and if I wanted watch Netflix and it works for all of that.It is made very well I definitely recommend this product."
1,I am happy....but much cheaper made than the last one I got.
1,Very nice
1,"I do not normally write reviews, but I am VERY happy with this product. It arrived very quickly, sounds fantastic, feels durable, and looks great."
-1,...trash 😡
0,ok
-1,"Updating my review.  Worked great but this one is not very durable. After a month of actual use, the end of the cable broke and got stuck in the phone.  Be aware of the warranty, tudia wants you to pay $5 to replace.  The cheaper cables last longer than these.  Will not buy this brand again."
1,"Works great for the note 2, havent had any problems so far. Also the phone mount can be used on other tripods, works great on my 5 foot tripod"
-1,bought these chargers and within a month 2 out of 3 of them were broken!
1,Pretty easy to use. Self explanatory. Broke the USB cord but luckily takes an easy to find generic cord. Good for the price.
1,"I've had this case for over a year and its been on and off my phone several times. I only have one little crack on the pink border in the front. Easy to get on and off but very sturdy. I know if I drop my phone, I'm not going to have a cracked screen."
1,Good quality for the price
1,"Love this little guy.... this is the second one I bought.  We used it to death.  Actually my 4 year old bent the first one too far.  We love this product.  Many positions, does not tip easily.  I bought 2 more.  Everyone in the family is always looking for the ipad stand."
1,works perfect
0,Have to use a cleaner to clean the glass.  Too small for the Galaxy's screen.  Leaves a gap between it and the Otterbox case I have!
1,"Phone charging cable. Exactly as advertised, and durable, doesnt feel cheap."
1,This phone wasn't Android 5 and is NOT 4glte on At&t networks .. other than that is a great phone for the money
1,"Works as promised - magnets powerful enough to hold a Nexus 6 without any issues.Have not seen any magnetic issues impacting the phone or contents.<br /><br />I have one gripe though, the front rotating plate falls off after a few rotations - I guess I was turning the phone in only one direction only after attaching it. It screwed back on without any problems, however, i cannot tighten it without piercing the rubber center to get to the head of the screw.Techmatte should place a stop not to allow the front plate to turn 360°."
1,Love it!! Use it all the time!
-1,Terrible
-1,"This product we received was NOT the product in the description. It was similar- but not enough for us to like it. The description states &#34; A locking swivel belt clip is easily locked into an extended position and provides different viewing angles while watching movies or video calls, also rotatable 180 degrees&#34; - however this was not possible with the case shipped to us. The silicone shell showed honeycomb grip interior in product photos, which was not what we received. The silicone shell also did not fit snug around the phone and was loose enough to look like it was not the right model for the phone - an HTC Desire 626s - which is stated in product description to be made to fit both 626 and 626s. All the buttons and cutouts for camera, mic, earbuds and charging were correct, and so was the outer shell and the front cover/holster fit nice and snug over the outer shell. Also in the photos it shows that the front cover / belt clip holster interior is covered in either felt or some other material to possibly help protect the phone screen. The product that we received was just the hard plastic interior. The item we received was ok - but we did not like how loose the inner silicone case looked on the phone (it appeared wrinkled around the edges when the outer case was applied) and were concerned it would slip off too easily and not provide the protection we desired. When the phone was inside the belt clip front cover/holster it did not feel like it would slip out but as the phone will be in the hands of a teen more than in its belt holster, this was a concern as well as the odd look it gave to the phone with the wavy/wrinkled look down the sides from the silicone not being a proper fit. We will be returning this product immediately and looking for something else."
1,"Fits perfect, good grade of rubber, clean look."
1,great little case.
1,"My family and I really love the product. It is really great feature with 360 rotation, I can move my cell to every angle.<br />What a brilliant idea!"
1,"If you really want what's worth for your money, iSmooth screen protector is the right for you! From buying to installation was as easy as 1-2-3!"
1,"very protective, feels great, just a little bit heavy. very well made."
1,"Installation was very easy, I just followed the instructions it came with and went on flawlessly. Would buy again if this one breaks or I get a new phone."
1,"Perfect if you have this phone and want quick access to it. Used it during courier work. Durable, easily to put on/take off, easy to remove phone from it and put it back in. I did NOT use the phone cover with it, so the phone just slid right on it. Kept phone from getting dropped, scratched, etc. Good product."
1,"Great case. Orange is a little brighter than pictured but that's fine with me; it's my favorite color. And I love the kickstand! The stylus is handy and the perfect size. The screen protector was a little tedious just to prevent a few finger prints. And no matter what I did I couldn't get the air bubbles out from underneath, so that ended up in the trash. But overall - for the price - great product bundle."
1,This decal is a perfect fit with my lifeproofcase and my phone looks great.
1,I bought two of these after I bought this one. It's kind of awesome and charges super fast!
1,This product works well.  It is challenging to find a good protective case for the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge due to the increased thickness of the phone after installing the Charging Qi Cover.
1,Great phone for the price
1,"Perfect, I needed this for my car, everyone wants to charge their phone while driving, this out let made it possible."
1,"I bought this after realizing my Ringke SLIM case was not protecting my screen entirely when my phone was inverted. It grips easily, doesn't have much visible branding, and it doesn't block any of the buttons, sensors, camera, or speaker functions. Highly recommend."
1,works good
1,Is very good
-1,One rainstorm and it shorted out. Product is not waterproof. Worked perfectly prior to that though.
1,Charges our Samsung S6 pretty well.  It is a little touchy as to where the phone needs to be placed to charge it.
1,Great case. Looks nice on the phone and the look makes it look like there is no case on it. I primarily only by Spigen cases and this is the reason why. On my iPhone I also use a Spigen thin case.
1,"Works very well for the intended use, i was actually a little surprised by the good quality of the sound, it's of course not a bose-like sound but it's pretty decent for a wireless headset. battery duration is very good, and overall no complains. I personally feel a little discomfort after wearing them for +45 minutes (at gym) since you really have to push them well inside your ears so that they stay in place. also the master and volume buttons are extremely difficult to use, i actually don't used them at all while wearing them (it's very hard to push), but i have no issues controlling everything from my phone."
-1,"HAD TO CUT IT TO MAKE IT FIT I PAD AIR AND COMES OFF WHEN I PUT CHILDPROOF CASE ON IT,BUT CANT BEAT THE PRICE"
1,Great
1,It is a perfect fit!
1,"i bought this for my iPhone 6 last year and within a month, dropped the phone. The screen protector cracked but my screen was fine. Tech armor quickly sent me a new screen protector, free, no hassles. Recently dropped my phone again cracking the protector. Quickly got a replacement for free!  I drop my phone a lot and the screen protector doesn't even scratch. I now have one on my iPad and the kids iPads. I especially like the anti-glare/anti-fingerprints for those. I will never use another brand!"
1,"Love this case on my Samsung Note 4, and even my 15 month old grand baby has not hurt the phone as many times as she has dropped it. Does exactly what it says, protects your phone."
1,Great stylus. It writes really smoothly. My boyfriend and I have been using it for months and it has been holding up really well. I prefer it way more than using my finger.
1,"Awesome product, very durable."
1,"Activated the phone with AT&T and it works great. I receive high signal strength almost everywhere I go at work and home. Not a top of the line phone but for the price and everything it comes with, very well worth it."
1,"Very simple to replace the battery. Found myself only using only a few of the array of tools provided. Replaced the battery in 10 minutes and it was like having a new phone! This battery will last me all day, and I no longer need to keep a charger with me at all times. Only downside is that this new battery gets very very hot, which is scary sometimes because the old battery never got THIS hot. However, it works well and I'm very pleased. It's been about 3 weeks since I've installed this new battery, and I've had no problems. Thank God!"
1,"Item came with no instructions within box. Item is as described, great sound and over all satisfied with purchase."
1,Great item at a great price and fast shipping!
1,Really cute wish it was a silver chain but still a cute black phone case wristlet
1,Really good head unit.  Sounds awesome and gives out plenty of power for my 7 speaker audio system in my car. Only problem I can think of is the option to save names of songs you hear on the radio is only for iPhone users and also I can't get my unit to dis play the name for radio at all via an analog connection.
1,"Great portable battery pack, and at an excellent price. It is a must have for anyone with multiple portable devices. I ordered this before taking a trip to Reno. It was more for my son since we let him use the iPad so that he could have something to do while we were on our way(by car) to Reno. This battery pack provides the extra juice necessary for the iPad and my iPhone.<br /><br />The LED light also comes in handy, but there is a negative. The light isn't straight, and points downward. Other then that, this thing is great!"
-1,"This is an updated review of these earbuds.  After about a month of using them once a week for about 2 hours each use, they keep disconnecting/reconnecting to my iPhone while I'm listening to music.  It happens frequently enough that it may do it once, twice or even three times during a single song.  The earbuds are fully charged while this is happening and the iPhone is in my pocket.  It has gotten so bad that I'm going to request either a replacement or refund."
1,"A durable case, screen protector and belt clip.  The belt clip is a bit large & clunkey but for my need of wireless charging it might be to cumberson to constantly install, remove the belt clip."
1,"Seems abit cheap, hard plastic, tight fit. But it does what it was made for, is handy and certainly protects your phone."
0,"its cheap....in price. and also kinda cheap in quality compared to other cases i have bought. but im still satisfied. I like the color. not much the style though, its a hard snap on with a silicone skin. the silicone kinda pops off the sides a little when I take it out of my pocket. minor issue but slightly irritating for me as a perfectionist."
1,Very satisfactory so far.
1,The absolute best in quality and customer service!
0,I always used garmin nuvi and when it broke I bought this Tom tom. The maps appear really old style looking. Hard to terminate routes.
-1,"2nd charger I bought from this company and it continues to overheat. I have used it on 4 different products and it gets very hot. Samsung S4, IPhone 5, IPhone 4, and my Note 4 and hot to the touch. Always!"
1,"If you're buying character vitamins, the characters are important, so I asked my daughter to tell me which shapes are in the bottle.  There's Gary, Sandy, Patrick, Eugene, and Squidward.  They taste like candy, not medicine at all, so I don't need to remind my kids to take their vitamins.  They ask me if they can take them, which is one less thing for me to remember.  Each gummy has thirteen vitamins and minerals, but it takes two gummies to make a dose for children 4 and up, which means one bottle is a thirty day supply for each child."
1,"Product was received for free in exchange of honest opinion. this is one of the most fancy car mounts I have had. it has a nice and specific shape and holds perfectly any type of device, smartphones as well. It is heavy and the package was really good. This product offers a lot of stability and protection for your phone while used in the car. I really like it."
1,This cable worked well on our nook.
-1,Do  not  waste  your  time!!!!!!
1,Battery is great. Still waiting for the charger.
-1,Took this with us on vacation to take pictures under water and didn't work.  Ended the life of my iPhone
-1,"DO NOT BUY! Had the screen cover  for almost a year, and when I installed it, it went on great. But recently dropped in and it hit the floor and cracked. The screen cover did not crack at all although. Isn't this suppose to prevent your screen from cracking??"
1,"great phone. I bought it for easier messaging and a phone.  It has features I'll never use, some I may use. The only thing that I'd like is a front facing camera so I can Skype!"
1,The case is very durable and the colors are beautiful.
1,"I have this for some time now, i love it. it charges my galaxy s4 very fast .And i just love that it has a flashlight!<br />It also seems very strong and durable.<br />Definitely recommend this."
1,I have had this case for a year and it's still kicking!
1,I love my new case! It's perfect! Love the Pink!!!
1,"Easy to put on, super clear. After 8 months, not a scratch on it. Works well with Mophie battery case -- fits right in the opening. I wouldn't know it was there except for the peace of mind. And I would never have a phone without one of these on it. A small price for excellent protection."
1,Having owned the original gear this is a great upgrade. I find it to be extremely well made and for me it's a must in my daily life.
-1,The highlight of this delivery was the fact that it arrived in one day.  I was disappointed to receive a blue cover when I asked for black and the back cover had the corner peeled back already.
1,Very satisfied
1,ok
1,"Love these cords!  But they need to make the plug in more narrow. Have to take phone out of its Otter Box to charge with this cord. That's why I only gave 4 stars. It is a very good, sturdy, and thick cord. That's what I love about this. I love the 10 ft length also."
0,"I like the case design, but it has a few flaws.  I guess for the money it is worth it.  But several of the plugs don't stay in so I ended up just cutting them off instead of sending it back for a replacement."
1,So cool!  This thing really works.  I was skeptical but thought I would give it a try.  It really works well and charges the phone really quickly.  I was given this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  I would definitely recommend this product.
-1,"Didn't like it.  Sleeve was slightly loose around my phone, and it was difficult to get in and out of the holster.  I got a different one after about a week."
1,I loved it
1,USE IT EVERYDAY
1,OK
1,Charges 3 dead phones.  Stand by power seems to last at least a week.  Works with apple and android.  Can't say enough about this phone  power rescue.
1,saves the kids phones
-1,Didn't work. Even after getting a replacement.
1,"Easy to install on phone, nice bright color, quick delivery"
-1,"Not impressed at all.<br />The front of the case is too big, so it's hangs over the side of the phone when closed. It barely stays closed without a magnet, which is disappointing. The interior black fabric attracts any and all dust and debris, and the case constantly looks dirty. I had it on for less than a day and bought something different."
1,works as advertised both vertically and horizontally.  Does not have the rotating plastic clip which I have &#34;snapped off&#34; of previous  several cases.<br />holsters galaxy note 4 in otterbox  defender case.
1,Exactly what I needed. Works great
1,I bought this to use with my paddle board on the lakes and rivers.  It works great. Works perfectly with my iPhone 6. I use to take pictures which come out awesome and can still listen to my music.  (No headphones). Has a little leash which is nice so I don't drop my phone in the water.
1,I was very happy with my watch.
1,We use them as cat toys because they bounce around and the cat loves them.
1,Great product.  No problems putting together.  Soft rubber.  Works really well to protect device.
1,Great!
1,Does what it says it will.
-1,This could never be found via Bluetooth
1,"A little slick on the hard plastic back, but very good case overall."
1,I've purchase 1 in every color since trying out my first one. The material feels the same & the bands act the same as my Apple sport bands. They are perfect!
1,"I like this charger alot! I have no problem charging my iphone or ipads, works great and fast. Love all the ports."
1,These are the best moderately priced headphones I could find that had android volume controls.
1,"Work great, price great"
1,Cheap price great quality!
-1,"The worst!  I did a good bit of research before buying but it did not help.  The phone froze, turn off, or turn into a black screen and locked. I finally returned it to factory condition and am trying to sell it.  I needed Motorola's help to return it to factory condition because it was locked. I did not lock it.  Motorola said it locked itself because it thought an unidentified user was trying to use it.  What a waste of time.  Stay away and save your money."
1,"Love my new case.<br />Fits my phone perfectly, allowing me to charge w/o removal from case.<br />Description was accurate & delivery was on time as expected."
1,"The person who repaired my phone told me that if I drop it one more time it probably won't work. After hearing that I decided to buy this to be safe. It works really well, I have dropped my phone a couple times and no cracks. What I really like about this also is that it doesn't scratch so my phone looks like it's new."
-1,"Fits the Note 3, not Note 4. Very dissatisfied. Forced it onto my phone and the pressure on the side buttons had the phone constantly restarting itself."
1,very good
1,excellent! Thank you
1,Great case. Extremely thin and my beautiful phone is still visible.
1,Good
1,This was a birthday gift for my teenage niece. She loves it!
1,Works Good. As Advertised..  :-)
1,"There's not too much detail to go into here. This works exactly as it should, to recharge my Jawbone Up band."
1,very pleased with my purchase .Was exactly what I was looking for.
-1,Broke after a week
1,Great product. Exactly as described. It fits very snug to my phone. Shipping fast as well
1,Just what I wanted!<br />I was able to follow easy instructions online in order to transfer parts from my old broken phone to this new part.
1,Nice case. A little less metallic than I expected but sturdy material
1,"This little speaker is great,very load for a small speaker with decent sound and charge lasts a long time,I'm very pleased with this speaker considering the price."
1,"Fits nicely came fast, hard to take off."
1,Crispy sound but had to make new holes for it cause the already did not fit
1,Awesome
1,OK
1,This case is awesome. I love it. The quality is great and the look is very sleek. Definitely worth it!
0,the accessory stylus broke
1,Nice design and works really well.
1,Like this car mount a lot that I ordered a couple more for the family.
1,"Wow, you will not find better Bluetooth headphones for under $25. They sound great, come with all the accessories that allow you to customize them to fit your ears perfectly. I really like the voice prompts, you know for sure if they are turned off."
-1,Love the look of the case but it's way to big for my iphone 4! It looks like it should fit an iphone 6! Definitely returning! (I put my iphone 4 case beside the one I received definitely not the right case!)
-1,"Product was not as described, further more the wrong one was sent, I would not recommend buying this product."
1,Very Nice
1,"Love, as these are 10 ft long."
-1,"Audio Quality is very bad, loud speakers not loud enough, low network issues"
1,Easy to apply. Item as described
0,"Solid product, however, the clear film protectant wasn't that easy to put on. You cannot charge the device without taking off the Gray Case Holder so it is a little inconvenience. But the product functions well"
1,Works so good just ordered one for my desk . One thing tho you do need a 2 amp charger. it comes with a usb wire but no charger.
1,"Fits well and looks like it will give good protection.  I like the feel in my hand - a problem with some cases.  It does add a little bulk, but that's to be expected for a case of this style.  The cut-outs are perfectly placed and it's easy to use the side buttons."
1,"PURCHASED AS A GIFT, SO THERE IS NO RATING FROM ME."
1,Good.
0,"Pretty good. But the flower came off within 1-2 weeks. Otherwise, pretty good material and a thick texture outside the case."
1,GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT
1,"Looks fine and works well. Pretty sturdy, hope it hold up to work though"
-1,"Does not work, failed to connect to all devices tested."
1,Beautiful case super fast shipping faster than expected Thankyou for getting it to me love the case. iPhone 6  has fallen and it was protected got it for when my kids play games. Love it Thankyou!! A++++
1,"Just received my first two, one is going as a gift.<br />Pro's-<br />1. Charged 4 phone pretty fast & still had 72% battery charge left<br />2. Hast a great tight carry pouch for both battery & cables.<br /><br />Semi Con-<br />1. Huge almost like an iPad mini.<br /><br />But for travel and day to day use so far seems awesome, will update review in a few weeks again."
1,"Mounted it to my CD slot in my '98 Buick Regal in a few seconds, and it covers my clock display only a little.  I put both magnets in between my Otterbox Commuter case and my iPhone 6 Plus (fits perfectly, can't even tell the magnets are there) and my phone is very secure on the mount.  Only time it fell was because I had not matched up the mount magnet well at all with the phone magnets when I set the phone on the mount, and even then it still held my phone well until I hit a severe bump.  This mount in combination with the JETech FM transmitter is a godsend, the latter especially for older cars.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*Ridiculously fast and easy installation<br />*Can rotate the phone to landscape without taking the phone off the mount.<br />*Holds my honking big iPhone 6 Plus with Otterbox Commuter case VERY securely (most important factor for me).<br />*SAFETY = improves attention to road (Don't have to fumble for phone, have it sliding around loose, falling, or sitting in your lap).<br />*Can see GPS navigation on the phone, switch songs, watch videos/movies, control phone calls, use earbuds with built-in mic.<br />*Can more easily hear if you get a call, txt, email, etc. especially when listening to music.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Blocks my clock display a little<br /><br />**TLDR: Works PERFECTLY with an iPhone 6 Plus and an Otterbox Commuter case using both included magnets. Fantastic for controlling music, calls, videos and GPS from your phone while enhancing safety."
1,Like this so much I got one for my wife and brother too!
1,Fast shipping & great price<br />It's doing a great job protecting my iPod & my brother and sister haven't complain about it either :)
-1,"Color, and the phone does not match."
1,"Compact, simple and effective. Rarely did I have trouble with people understanding me."
1,"Excellent seller,  item meets the specifications"
1,perfect
1,The screen protector was pretty good on my note 5. I wish it covered a little more on the width but with a case the fitting was perfect. However my first shipment of this product came with a slight blemish but amazon sent me a replacement right away. Overall a good product for the price.
-1,"The card slots are not durable. The seams keeping the cards in are already coming apart. Casing broke in 3 locations - bottom by the speaker, volume and lock button. Great price point, you get what you pay for."
-1,It was not what I expected and I would love my money back if i could get it. It did not come with the materials I thought it would.
1,Great case
0,The only issue I had was it seemed like the magnet for the closure was wearing out.  Maybe I just use my phone too much. :)
1,"Great case, except I made the mistake of ordering one for an iPhone 6 instead of an iPhone 6 plus. All around a great case. Replaced my order for the correct case just now :)"
1,Very happy with order. Came a few days earlier than when Amazon told me it will be deliver. Very happy customer.
-1,"This is the second one of these that I have purchased; the first one lasted for nearly 8 months before the corners started to crack and fall off, but this second one lasted less than 10 days. The plastic near the volume and power buttons is very fragile and will break apart if you're not careful. It's a shame because these are really good looking cases."
1,EXCELENTE
1,"Very satisfed with the sound quality, and the pairing was totally painless.  This is a great product and I highly recommend this product to others."
1,"[[ASIN:B00U0JVW7G SaharaCase iPhone 6 Case - Rugged Protection, Thin and Lightweight, Includes Tempered Glass Screen Protector, Professional Camera Hood, Stunning Colors Including Black and Gray Sahara Case]]I  the case is one that wont slip out of your hand and it protect good too.also have to say that the temper glass that you sent with that is probably one of the best ones that I have had for not leaving fingerprints very bad and it wipes off very easy"
-1,"Cute case, however it did not fit my phone properly. Material was also a little on the thin side."
1,"Great customer service, great watch :)"
1,Works well.very satisfied
0,"Its a good workout bra. It says that it doesnt dig into your skin but worn underneath a kevlar vest, it does. Definitely not one to wear for a 13 hr shift."
1,Yes I like this.  Works on surfaces and case type material you wouldn't expect.
1,I was a great case.
1,Just as described- great tools for the job! Everything worked well. Very happy with my purchase. I would completely recommend!
1,Does exactly what i need it to do and that is charge my phone.
1,"Works well, but sometimes you have to talk loudly."
1,These are soo cute and easy to use got here fast
-1,Price is way to high
1,"I do love working out and music is absolutely necessary for me to do so. I did order this sport armband to carry my iPhone 6  through a special promotion to try it and share my honest opinion. I will start by saying I got the pink one and it is a very nice bright pink so I can always find in my purse or gym bag. It is made of sturdy materials and neoprene which makes it very comfortable to wear, I have mine for hours in a day without being bothersome at all!  Super well stitched so it won't rip apart with time . has two holes to strap it so it will fit small and larger biceps. The controls on screen do work from the clear plastic, you do not have to remove it to slide it or access the apps.Great quality and I do recommend it."
1,"It is Short! But very effective and after a month in the amazon through humidity, sun, and even a little rain, it managed to survive unharmed and still works great."
1,EXCELENTE
1,These work.  Fit is fine.  My three kids used one to plug three headphones into one iPod shuffle on a recent car trip.    update: July 2016 they still work fine.  No change.
1,Works great for my car!
-1,"I was a little skeptical about purchasing a solar charger since I have never used one before...I am usually a positive person and try to make the best out of all the things I purchase on Amazon even if it turns out not how I wanted. But this product, solar charger in general has got to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever come by.  It does not charge at all! I was really disappointed and is in the process of returning it now.  Left it in the sun all day and not a single charge!?  It barely charged using the USB/wall charger(very slowly), but my purpose of getting it was to be able to use the solar.  I am taking a vacation trip to the villages of Laos/Thailand and I know most of the villages don't have wall chargers and so I was looking forward to using this to help charge my batteries for my go pro. But too bad it does not work and I don't think I'll be investing in any solar chargers for now on. Save your money and invest in a external battery power banks instead..."
1,"It work well , have no issues"
1,No it didn't last at all
-1,"Did not line up perfectly on my Samsung Avant, and it did not install bubble free."
1,Really love work perfect for my i phone and Lg G3 will order again
1,"I recently bought a new iPhone 6Plus with a Lifeproof Nuud case, based on the recommendation of the Verizon Saleswoman. The LIFEPROOF was a complete & expensive waste of $$MONEY$$. No one could understand what I was saying - they said I sounded like I was underwater.  THEN I ordered WILDTEC as a replacement. WOW, compared to the $110 Nuud, WILDTECK was a steal! Easy to install AND more importantly everyone can understand what I'm saying now! ONLY one small concern, the APPLE Lightning charging cable, is a very, very tight fit thru the case port. IF you don't mind trimming or shaving aftermarket cable connectors in order to fit, this IS the case for you! I am a happy customer!!!!! Thanks Wildtek...."
-1,"Seeing how there aren't very many waterproof cases out for the note 4, I decided to give this one a shot. First off, I chose this product cause it looked better than the other options available on the market.  Out of the box: it's a nice looking case with decent cut outs (could've made the boarders less thick to allow edge-to-edge accessibility, but there's another draw back to this that's pointed out later on), foam and rubber parts were nice, back kick  stand is a little tough to get out but is a very nice addition, the rubber notification cut out was a definite plus for me.  Testing: alright, so taking apart the case is slightly rough but the snapping when you close it is oh so satisfying. The water test went fine; put a piece of paper in the case, sealed it off, submerged it under water for an hour, shook off the water, opened it up and the paper was still dry. The bubbles that come out of the bottom speaker vent is normal. Had no issues with watching videos and audio being muzzled. Only my OEM charger would fit, which they state somewhere in the papers along with screen protector usage being ill advised when paired with this case (found this to be true).  Conclusion and why I'm giving it a two star rating: it was a great product when I used it for all of a week but decided to take it off and the corner of the front panel, above the s pen door, broke. On that note, the mechanism that opens for the s pen access is EXTREMELY weak and a little pressure on it will open it. As I need to constantly open the case to swap out the battery for a fresh one, this may have considerably weakened the case, but this shouldn't be to the point where a corner cracks open due to it. I wanted to like the case, but you really get what you pay for and it's not the best long term product to go with."
1,One of my favorite cases I've ever owned!
1,It was a gift for my daughter and she likes it
-1,"It was a bad experience , the videos do not work."
1,excellent product!
1,"I have to say I'm very impressed with this case.  It's definitely on the thin side (but not the thinnest), yet I think provides sufficient protection.  I ordered 3 different cases based on reviews (all very good) and this one is one of the top two.  Probably the top if you want to combine protection, yet being thin.  When I received it, I actually though they sent the wrong one.  (It looked like one piece).  It was just slightly challenging to get on, but as one reviewer stated, I started at the top and worked my way down.  I can't decide if the little cover on the power slot will be annoying or if it's a great idea to keep out pocket lint.  At least you have the option of cutting it off.  For the price, the protection and reasonable thin-ness of this case, I would definitely recommend."
1,Good product
1,Worked perfectly for our backpacking trip. I live in southern AZ so I have not tried it in part sun.
1,Does the job.
1,Decent headset for the price
1,"The Docking Cradle works fine. But this was not my problem. I have to replace the antenna, the cable connection is bad. I keep loosen the signal."
1,"Perfect fit.  Took me all of about 5 minutes, maybe even less, to install.  I have no idea how my son managed to break the original."
1,Great product liked it very much.  Would order again.
-1,On the outside of the wallet I was expecting it to say crown like it shows in the picture. Crown was misspelled to cronw so I did not enjoy this product at all.
1,Wish the magnetic clousure was more secure. Overall i enjoy the case. The credit card slot is perfect but of you put too much it won't close. The most I put is my id and 2 cards.
-1,Horrible! didn't last 3 days of use.
-1,"Product shipped quickly. Nice looking case however like several other reviews mentioned, it does not fit snugly on the sides. Not sure if some fit and some don't but it was really annoying to have it fit so loosely."
-1,This is a case of you get what you pay for.  The head phones worked when I was sitting still.  The sound quality was good and the BT connection was easy to establish.<br />The problem came up when I took them on a run.  They started to cut out often and more so the faster I ran.  I reduced the issue by putting the phone on my right arm.  It will still cut out if I turn my head.
1,"Great, durable product. Fast delivery."
-1,I bought three of these and they blow out the fuses in all three cars I own.  Stay away from them!
0,Pretty case. But the inner piece that actually holds the phone starting breaking apart piece by piece after a couple of months.
1,Pros:<br />Received item quickly<br />Colors match pictures<br />Magnet seems strong<br />Phone fits perfectly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Smidge of blue color on the green flap (see pic)<br /><br />Other than that I'm happy!
1,Great product and fairly simple to put together. Looks good but be ready to purchase another cable since its pretty much there once you set it up! Highly recommended if ill end up being a charging station in your desk or something!
-1,It keep sticking
1,The remote works fine but the trunk opening button doesn't work on my model car. Oh well
1,simple and effective.  magnet strong enough to hold through a spigen case on iphone 5s
1,Great USB hub.  Charges all of my tablets at once....and quickly!
1,perfectly fits my iphone 6 with otterbox
1,"Cute & fun, easy to match with"
-1,"Update:  Yea, they'll replace the broken screen protector, but they charge you $5.99 for shipping (which actually cost them like $2.00 by first class mail) so now they have your credit card number.  Better off just throwing it away.  Really getting tired of getting used products from Amazon.  Had dirt in the adhesive, no microfiber cleaning cloth.  Can't get it to stick down to the screen at the bottom around the home button.  Really hard to hang on to this thing to get it positioned accurately on the phone.  Probably would help to put a piece of masking tape across the front to hold on to, and also take the phone out of any case you have it in."
1,"LOVE IT, VERY BRITE PURPLE COLOR. FITS GREAT AND MAKES IT EASY TO HOLD ON TO YOUR PHONE."
1,Very nice product.  I highly recommend.
1,It's great
0,"Was cute, jewels fell off very quickly"
1,"This case is pretty good and does its job well. The only problem I have with it is that it is a gold color, and not the bright yellow that it is pictured to be on Amazon. I wish that the correct color could have been shown in Amazon when I was looking to purchase it. Update on October 20, 2015- I wanted a red case for my Galaxy J1, to keep in mind God's wonderful gift of salvation to us, through &#34;the blood of Jesus Christ his Son (that) cleanseth us from all sin.&#34; 1 John 1:7, KJV. I checked out several red cases for the Samsung Galaxy J1, but this was the one I could afford. I went with what I knew, even though the gold one I had at first ordered from Bemz was not as bright yellow as I would have liked, as previously mentioned. But on this case, Bemz came through with FLYING COLORS! This case matches the bright color shown on Amazon, and is not a darker red, as I feared it would be! Good job, Bemz!!!  So now I give Bemz a five-star review!!"
1,"I had a garmin 305 and liked  that until i took it swimming. I ordered the 310xt and had to send the first one back as there was a problem with the battery. This one seems to work fine, I think Garmin products are the only way to go, I have a garmin nuvi for my car and a rhino 530 for the woods"
0,seems like the pills strength differs from one pill to the next and is never consistant.
1,"Excellent product. As advertised. Patience is key however. Especially when removing the old cracked screen. I practiced on my old broken S3, so I could understand process better. Luckily I did since I overheated old phone LCD with heat gun. Using tape on cracked screen face was a HUGE help to prevent wire from getting hung up on broken glass pieces. Be sure to watch the youtube video before or during replacement."
1,works as it is supposed to
1,"Beautiful and functional design. Simple, sophisticated and elegant"
-1,I have purchased 2 of them already and the clip keeps breaking after a couple of weeks.
1,I get a ton of comments on this case. It is super relaxing to watch at work when not smart people get me angry. Totally worth buying!
1,Works great because I have the phone e in a case.  A magnate system wouldn't work  Very easy to use. .
1,This case fits my sons moto G perfectly. The cutouts are lined up exactly with all of the ports unbutton and the raised edges around the screen help to protect that from getting scratched or cracked. Kids are so hard on their phones and it's nice to know so with this case I'm getting enough protection that I won't have to be buying a brand new phone here in just a few more months. It's inevitable that it's going to be dropped and that's why I knew I had to get a case with good protection. I have another case by this brand that I personally use on my LG g4 and it's fantastic.  I love their prices and the peace of mind I get knowing my phone id's safe. The cases are lightweight and do not add all kinds of crazy bulk to the designs of our phones yet still manage to offer great protection from accidental drops and bang ups. I am extremely impressed and pleased with the performance of these phone cases and would not hesitate to buy other cases from them. I did receive this case free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes however my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion of this brand and their case.
1,These are so convenient. I bought several and gave as gifts. They were so well received. Great value and quality too.
0,Shipment did not have  ansy initial instructions with it..
0,"i got this price discounted , i tried to my cellphone and its cannot hold properly"
-1,"bad product without completely disposable manufacturers warranty and never respond, I do not recommend this brand much less sellers."
1,"Works great, feels exactly like the naked the iPhone screen; super smooth and responsive!"
1,"This selfie stick is relatively easy to use. It's adjustable, so that's an added bonus and I like the box it came in. The packaging is gifty which is a huge plus for me."
1,Great.
1,No complaints. Seems pretty good so far. Basically getting 2 for less than the price of one from apple.
1,"Great product, looks great & holds up very well"
1,A little tight but I fixed that!
1,"It was easy to place and looks great.<br />The touchscreen seems to more response with glass.  The company gives great support, if needed."
1,Great charger for my iphone 6.  It provides a speedy charge.
1,"I bought this unit and it looks great for my 2008 Honda Accord.  I installed it myself, also install a back up camera. The compliments I get on the new unit is great. I would really recommend this to anybody that's looking to upgrade.  Bluetooth for the phone  another great feature. All my steering wheel controls still work."
1,"This is a fabulous thing to have. I have a screen protector on my phone already, and even when I put it in the waterproof case I have NO trouble using the touch screen. It is simple to use, and thus far I have had no issues. I can even take great photos with the waterproof case on. Also, the neck strap is great because I can use it too attach the whole set up to my kayak and not have to worry about it falling overboard. Great deal!"
1,muy buen producto
1,This is the 2nd of this style dash mount. Works best for us and our vehicles. Minnesota State law does not allow us to attach items such as gps or radar detectors to the windshield directly (VERY STUPID LAW). This makes the unit secure and we are able to lower it to the floor to help hide it so our car is less likely to be broken into.
1,"If you are accustomed to an Otter Box like enclosure, this case is very similar in feel / style. Thee 8500mAH battery cannot be beat! If you need the longest lasting battery and don't mind the admittedly larger case, this product is for you.<br /><br />My only dislike is the implementation of the belt clip. The case is excellent, feels good in your hand. I think the phone is easier to hold and use the virtual keyboard. I wish the belt clip was a little better. It's secure, but nearly impossible to insert/remove with one hand. Perhaps it will loosen up with time. That's a small complaint for a case/battery combination that will give you unmatched runtime between charges and excellent protection of the phone."
1,Good battery
-1,"It crack less than two days, it fit so tight it was very hard to take off."
0,The item arrived sooner than I expected. The only issue is the mic pickup is seemingly weak as people have reported they have difficulty hearing me during conversations. 1/3 the price of the LG model.
1,Beautiful case that showcases my iPhone 6 very well. I thought it would be harder to get it on because of previous reviews but it really wasn't that bad. The video attached to the case wasn't very helpful though. It was for a different supcase. Great product!
1,a great investment to protect a $300 Cell Phone
1,Awsome case!! Fits well. Looks great. Durable and appealing.
1,Still work after accidentally being washed!
1,Perfect Bluetooth
1,"Has lasted me a long time, a must have if you have a cell phone! I would've rated it 5 stars but since the button sometimes turns on or off in my bag I took the star off. The button is too easily pressed."
1,"One of the four does not like to stay connected to devices so minus one star. The cables are the perfect size to accompany my battery packs for recharging on the go. And, the fun colors made giving my extras as gifts a great experience."
-1,Does not work with the iPhone 6. It says the accessory is not supported. Useless
1,Item as described!
-1,I am not pleased with the s5 galaxy case!
1,Looks great and works perfectly
1,I love this phone charger. It works beautifully.  You can attach phone in your bag and in a matter of time your phone is charged.. it was worth the money spent.
1,"Great case, would highly recommend if you want to streamline and not take away from your already well designed iPhone"
1,"Protective and slim case, easy to grip and buttons are accessible."
0,It's okay.  Definitely on the cheap side.  But you get what you pay for.
0,didn't use product. went with the s6 edge instead
-1,Didn't work
1,Great product. Fast shipping too.
1,the best thing ever!
-1,"Only reason that I couldn't rate it lower is because there isn't any option for fractional stars. The battery is junk, was worse than the last junk batter that I got sold. It is from 2013, so I presume its repackaged junk?<br /><br />It also had identifying information &#34;redacted&#34; with a metallic paint pen."
1,Nice speaker crisp sound with no distortion. Bought for kayak trips since its water proof but have not been due to inclement weather but I'm sure it will be awesome once out there
1,Great!  Now I don't need to switch out different charging cords in the car.
1,"Holds the phone fine evan with an Otter Box.  Secure, the phone never falls out"
1,Very useful and economical way to convert the existing micro USB connectors to lightning connectors. Working flawlessly so far.
1,Love it!!
1,"Go-to, inexpensive mp3 player for my workouts. I'm on my 3rd one (have been wearing them out for about 8 years). The clips eventually break or the headphone jack gets messed up (causing the sound goes out in one ear), but I'm talking after a couple of years of very heavy use/abuse.<br />---PROS:<br />-Inexpensive<br />-Clips onto clothes for hands-free use<br />-Comes with COBY earbuds (I have trouble using any other kind due to an inner ear piercing)<br />-Comes with USB converter that you use to charge the battery and upload music from your computer (I charge it using my computer)<br />-Battery life is at least a few hours/several days of working out<br />-Has a shuffle/random setting, hold button, pause button, fast forward skip, and rewind/backwards skip buttons as well as volume adjustment<br /><br />---CONS<br />-No screen<br />-No folder/playlist options (unless you have shuffle on, songs will play in the order you uploaded them)<br />-The last one I purchased didn't have as strong a clip as previous ones (slides off my shirt if I'm running strenuously). This could just be a fluke, since I've never had this problem before with previous ones.<br />-Sometimes I wish it would turn up louder. Some of my music files are on the quiet side so if I'm near traffic I can't hear them as well as I'd like to- however, this could be a headphone problem. Most of the time, it is plenty loud.<br /><br />Love this product because I can listen to music while working out and not have to carry it. I don't have to worry about it breaking or falling, because it is so inexpensive to replace. It's very small and practically weightless. Uploading music is simple- think dragging mp3 files onto a thumb F: drive. Charges quickly and holds battery life long enough. I also purchased a USB wall outlet for super cheap so I can charge it when I'm not around my computer. Overall, a great bargain for the price if you're looking for a lightweight, no-frills shuffle mp3 player!"
0,An Otterbox Defender series was not available when I ordered the Moto G (3rd gen.) so I chose the his case because it had a belt clip holster & kickstand. I like how easily it fits though it could use an integrated plastic screen protector. It also shipped sooner than expected which is always a plus. Quite pleased with this purchase & saved about $43 (as compared to Otterbox pricing). Thanks.
1,"My first Tile died. This was a replacement. It could have a louder sound, but at least the GPS was very accurate."
1,Worked great. Excellent replacement part.
-1,Very difficult to get on the phone.  The volume turn on/off did not work.
0,I like it but the green camo is staring to come off
1,"Nice and convenient when multiple people in the car need to charge and they're all different types of devices. (i-phone, droid, tablet, etc)"
-1,"Phone is extremely heating on the back side while playing candy crush it seems unusual, lags are also there on the lock screen. Screen is heating while voice call. Battery is depleting rapidly while gaming like 20% in 15 minutes. My experience with yureka plus is going well."
-1,It does not stick to your car.
1,"works great, highly recommended if you're using a bumper case with this phone. item arrived quickly and in good shape as well."
1,"Exactly what I wanted. It's very thin and smooth, doesn't look bulky. I'm not sure how well it would protect the phone if I dropped it but so far so good."
1,very good
-1,Battery is shot less than a week after buying it. It dies starting at 15%
1,works perfect
-1,Broke in 4 hours
-1,I bought this and it didn't even last 2 weeks. The plastic covering on the cord pulled off exposing the inner wire. The inner wires then began to fray and I had to move the wire a certain way to get it to charge.
1,good product original
1,Works Great!
1,Good
1,It is just what I wanted.
1,Easy to use and a firm grip on your phone
1,works perfect
1,This digitizer worked perfectly. After trying two others from local online suppliers whom I suspect were recycling parts without testing this one worked and is still working flawlessly. The tool kit and screen cleaning cloth were very helpful.
1,"Love this little radio for the porch and camping. Small size and good sound. Seems to get great reception, too. Very pleased with this product for the price."
1,Very handy good to have when traveling
0,"I was hesitant to get the Rugby 4 because the reviews were pretty mixed, but there aren't many flip phones around, my sturdy but ancient Nokia was dying, and the Rugby was the only one with the features I wanted.  All told I'm pretty satisfied with it, but it definitely has its problems.  The phone feels solid and the hinge feels like it'll endure.  Voice quality is good.  It weighs a bit more than I expected, but that's a minor matter.  Although I didn't specifically want a ruggedized phone, which probably contributes a bit to the weight, I managed to drop it three times on the first day so I'm glad about that anyway.  The navigation keys are a little too small, so I often press something I don't want.  As has happened to others, the phone randomly turned itself off -- twice on the third or fourth day I owned it, and once more a few days later -- but it hasn't done it since then (a couple weeks?)  so maybe it was just the battery breaking in or something.  ** Later edit: apparently I had the phone open when I found that the volume controls turned off silent mode; when phone is closed, the volume controls have no effect.  On the other hand, the phone's turned itself off a couple more times.  The operating system, unfortunately, is very poorly thought out.  The address book is bizarre: you can assign a person four different types of mobile phone number, but not a single landline number.  I have yet to encounter a business that only works with mobile phones, except for construction contractors, and many of them also keep a landline.  Many individuals maintain a landline too (like me).  On the other had there's a field for a fax number.  Now, even if many places still had faxes, how would a mobile phone use one?  There's a field for home address but not business address.  Etc.  Unlike my previous phone, you can only have one note per address book entry.  Also, you can only put a few, mostly pre-selected items in the shortcut list.  So, for example, you have to dig through a few menus to put the phone into silent mode; it would be better to be able to put that on your shortcut list, but that's not possible.  Speaking of silent mode, for some reason Samsung stupidly lets the volume controls turn it off.  So if you have the phone on silent, put it in your pocket, and a volume button somehow gets pressed, guess what, your phone will go off while you're in a meeting or at a movie.  So the safest bet is to turn the phone off completely.  The GPS only gives directions if you have a subscription for it with AT&T.  (Unfortunately I didn't know that when getting the phone, because GPS was on my &#34;want&#34; list.)  Also it seems that if you don't make AT&T the home page on the browser, your browsing will often get DNS errors, so don't bother trying to put a particular web page among your shortcuts, and accept that you'll get dinged for data usage to view a web page you don't want.  (Hopefully that will stop when I get around to unlocking the phone.)  There's a manual on the Samsung website, but it leaves some things to be desired.  For example, if you connect the phone to your computer, it will ask if you want mass storage or Samsung Kies -- with no explanation in the manual of what Samsung Kies is.  You have to dig around the Samsung website to discover that Kies is a progam that lets you transfer files and backup and edit the address book.  Incidentally Kies includes the fields one would think an address book entry should have (e.g., landline numbers), but they won't transfer to the phone that way.  Still, once I got the phone set up and accepted the fact that the OS was developed by dolts, it did what I wanted it to do, and I appreciate the ruggedization now."
1,I added these to my iPhone EarPods for running and they work great!  Sound quality is better and EarPods have a better fit. Before you spend a bunch of money on another set water resistant headphones give these a try.
1,Works great!
1,It's GREAT.
-1,"Is pretty, but it open real easy,I recommended to use a wallet and not to hang it over the shoulder has a purse.I hardly use it. not worth the money."
1,Great for the old phones.
1,All Great
1,"I was surprised to see a charger included with the order. I thought it was just a coupla' batteries and ordered a charger to go with it....oh well. Anyway, I'm pretty happy."
1,Works perfect!
-1,Terrible. Won't pertact your phone at all. Waste of money.
1,Finally one i like the quality enough to keep!
-1,OK but can walk away from the phone that far loose single
1,All Great
0,Fast but the flower fell off
1,Easy to apply and practically invisible.
1,"This is a pretty awesome case.  Wasn't expecting much, but can find anything bad to say about it.  Not only is it a solid case, it's screen protectors aren't bad at all.  The Note 5 is pretty light and feels pretty fragile, but this adds just the right amount of weight to make it feel solid.  Comes with nice little extras.  Two protectors, one for front and one for back.  The one for the back is to stop the rainbow effect because the back is glass.  I also think it would help if any dirt or grit gets behind the case. The case also comes with a little film on the front and back of the case to protect it during shipping.  Again just a little thing to is nice.  Also the dust caps for the charger port and headphone jack fit nice and tight.  If you are looking for a good case, this one is worth well more than they are charging."
1,I'm in love with this case. The colors are really nice they go with each other. It's very smooth and easy to put on. It fits perfectly and it protects.
0,"This case is very cute and it does it's job of protecting your phone if you drop it, but it broke VERY easily when taking it off. I switch my batteries out often since I have an extra battery that charges outside the phone. The case cracked down the top middle the first time I took it off and then cracked a little more down the back each time I took it off again. The case is made of what feels like a soft plastic which is why it was so easy to crack. If you plan on leaving your case on all the time (like a normal person) then this case is great. BUT if you take your case off a lot or like to switch cases often, I don't recommend this product.<br /><br />Also, the stand was VERY hard top open up and use at first. I had to open it and close it a lot to break it in so it would finally open with ease. Once I did that, the stand was amazing."
1,"Works great, like it supposed to, would definitely recommend."
-1,"Product summary on web says it fits 5C, but actual package and instructions on delivery say it is only for 5 and 5S. Amazon summary is incorrect and should be revised. 5C definitely does not fit."
1,Looks great and phone is well-protected; meets all expectations.
-1,It is to tight when you have the Otter box on your phone.<br />Very hard taking the phone out of the leather case.
1,"I must own more than 5 different iPhone cases for my iPhone 6+ but the is my preferred one now.  It offers good protection, good hand feel and the card slot works well because there is a mechanism to prevent cards from dropping out."
0,"So for $20 it is fine. It does not sync for messaging for the iphone but works for phonecalls just fine. I just like it for telling time and for $20 that is good enough for me. All the other features are just extra. Not the greatest smartwatch, but what the heck it was cheap."
1,"Mounted with ease, used it today for a 5 mile bike ride and it worked great. It adjusts to fit any phone and holds it secure enough to ride on the road, up and down hills etc."
1,Works like a charm and is comfortable!
1,"I use it in my '98 Buick Regal and I have driven upwards of 2 hours around the Austin area with literally NO interference or issues.  I've used it almost on a daily basis for 2 months and not had a single problem; music and GPS comes through from my iPhone 6 plus crystal clear, and all this success from the very first station I tried it with."
-1,Didn't work. Did the same thing my old batteryou did.
1,Very pleased real quality don't fuss with those plastic screen protectors this one blows all the plastic ones away.
1,"This is the best case for a phone I've ever seen.  Sleek, sexy, feels good...and affordable!  Fits my phone perfectly!"
1,This case is great!  The storage door closes securely.  I am able to fit my drivers license and a credit card.  I have had this for about 1 1/2 years and it has held up well.  After one too many drops the door recently got a crack.  It makes it a little difficult to close but once closed it still hold my card securely.  The hole for the camera did not interfere with taking pictures.  Most headphones and power cords fit as well.  It is a tight secure fit on the phone so this not something that can be taken off and on easily.
1,"Awesome screen protector! I was having touch issues on my G4 with my previous tempered glass cover, this one is much better and much more responsive!"
1,Not bad for $10.has good rubber cushion on edges and doesn't interfere with screen.im satisfied
1,Bit loose
1,"Good battery life, just undependable Bluetooth. Couldn't get it to work reliably"
-1,had my phone in this and it still broke
0,Front case does not like to stay on.
1,"The PowerJive blocks are as advertised. As in cables, you cannot have enough of these around the house or office. The blocks are sturdy and USB plugs fit firmly. There is no wiggle. These have the appearance as the stock blocks that come with an iPhone.<br /><br />I tested the output of these PowerJive blocks and the results were good. They met the 5v 1A claim. See my pics below for the result of the test."
1,thanks
-1,It wouldn't sync with any of my iPhones and the quality seemed pretty bad.  Also the plastic part that went on your ear seems awkward and uncomfortable.  This is your typical you get what you pay for made in China junk.
0,Poor quality of the graphic on the cover.
1,This stick is the best one I've seen by far.  It's so easy to use and extremely versatile in terms of the types of equipment you can use it with.  The materials and construction are solid.  We are taking this with us on our trip to Greece later this week so I will report back later.  One more thing...the company has done an outstanding job of following up to make sure we are happy with the product.  Great customer service so far.
1,Best way to mount gps
1,"One of the best deals I picked up this summer. No more juggling between low-battery devices. Also, I neither recommend nor condone juggling while driving."
1,I received the universal bike mount and was very excited about my purchase.  It fit the bike and was easy to put on and works great.  Now I have a place to carry my cell phone when riding.  I would recommend the universal phone mount to a friend.
1,Very well please with the dock and play if I had the chance and I needed another one I would buy again
1,Super cute(:
1,Very good
-1,Broke the first time I used it.
1,I love it. Looks and feels great. What can you say about a simple phone case other than it looks like the pic came right on time with prime two day shipping and seems durable enough. For the price it is great. Everything lines up like it should. All the slots and buttons line up perfectly and the headphones seat properly. I hate when you get a cover that things are off like that. So very nice. Seems durable but I just got it so can't comment on that yet but will if there is an issue I will update. I don't think there will be it feels like its made of good quality material and design.
1,Loved it...not too bulky but still very protective!
-1,It was for the wrong phone. It may stay for a one plus one but it looks like it would fit an iPhone 6. It was a beautiful case now looked at it and it looks like it would fit my phone but it didn't.
1,Great product bought on Amazon!!
1,worked perfectly
1,Bluetooth still in use still working only one problem I'm having with the Bluetooth it does not tell me who's calling but it doesn't matter still everything is A OK
-1,Very misleading description. Plus it was overpriced. I found one similar on ebay for much less and of better quality.
1,Better than the ones Verizon &#34;gave&#34; me...
1,great Product.no instructions but look it up on YouTube
-1,It didnt last a year as a car charger!
1,"[[VIDEOID:f8ef8c6c7d56750ad91fb50c6d4ca3c5]] ✏️ Quick thoughts to supplement my video demonstration.<br /><br />I like this cable adapter (converter) because:<br />- There are 3 ports (HDMI, VGA, and DVI) from which I can choose. I've had to carry around three separate adapters before. (actually I have a sweet VGA and HDMI adapter, but I didn't know they also made one that has DVI, like this one. Awesome!)<br />- It works in my MacBook Pro.<br />- The image is beautiful.  No distortion as far as I can tell. (I'd recommend always trying to use the HDMI port)<br />- While it's surprisingly big, it's certainly smaller than three whole converter cables together.<br />- Fits nice and snug into my Macbook Pro and doesn't wiggle out.<br /><br />Note: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration. Hope this demonstration and test helps!<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />👍 Yes, absolutely."
1,fits almost ant were like it
1,LOVE IT!  Now I don't need a screen protector. Best feature is the answer without opening although not sure I have figured out how to hang up without opening.
1,"This phone holder is a great tool for me, because the mount stays firmly in the air vent of my note, I have many holder for phone, but this is a great one than others. I recommand this holder, I`m sure you will love it. And thanks for your gift, I give it to my son, he love it very much. Thank you, five star."
1,So nice that the cables have connectors that are small enough to fit through the holes in my phone case. Good product!
1,I love my case
1,"I love it, fits perfectly on the phone and in my hand.  :)"
1,It's a nice touch especially with the Chevy cobalt...... Bought it for my boy friend.... Fits perfectly in 06'..... And a little cubby in the bottom...... Hands free
1,OK
1,Just what I expected.
1,i absolutely love this case. It shipped super fast and is exactly as pictured/described. Unlike other cases this one has 4 card slots which is what i was looking for. Mine also came with a screen protector and one of those watersafe ziplock bags that you can put your phone into if you are doing water sports like kayaking or paddle boarding. Overall great product
1,"Looks exactly as it did in the photo and feels very secure. I had purchased the iPhone 5 version when it came out, so felt I should go with the same brand and style with my iPhone 6. Was not disappointed."
1,Great for running in my iphone +<br />Seem it will last a while
0,"My problem is I needed a 6&#34; which is what they are advertised as, but are actually 6.5"
1,Excellent!
1,Same original equipment that came with phone.
1,awesome rugged case--great buy
1,Love it!!!
1,"Works great and charges fast, perfect to keep in a purse or backpack."
-1,The part that protects the screen pushes the button in on the phone turning it off and on which kills the battery. I would not recommend this product.
1,cool!
1,Anker is a great brand. Love their products. This charge is great for travel. Light and powerful. I bought one more for my wife as well. Great buy.
1,"Absolutely great. Sturdy. Great attention to detail. Phone fits well, and all controls are readily accessible. The only improvement that could be made is adding a magnet, but no complaints here!"
1,"Excellent radio. Get one, you'll love it."
1,This is the best phone case I have ever owned! Plus I love the haunted mansion so it looks cool. I've had it on my phone since Fall 2013.
1,"Amazing piece of equipment. I installed in a Polaris Ranger to drive two Pioneer TS-MR2040 8&#34; marine speakers, in bridge mode. It is a perfect match! It could fit in the glove box of a car or even a center console. It is the size of two beer cans and puts out the power of a 12 pack. The only downside is that there are no adjustments on the amp but at this point I don't know I would even use them. The blue tooth pairing was beyond simple. It took me about 45 seconds from the time it powered on to the point I had music blaring."
0,"Works for the most part. Unlike the original cradle, I sometimes I have to wiggle the watch or the USB cable to make it work."
1,I'm OCD or I would have given 5 stars
1,Good for the festive of color I put my phone in this while fishing just incase.
1,"This is a great charger. I like that it has a well placed light to tell you if it's charging. This charger is a great color of purpley-red to add a little fun to your accessories. This color makes it certain that my husband and sons will not pick my charger up and take off with it! I've had no problem with this charger. We own several vehicles, and I got tired of forgetting to grab a charger from another vehicle or not realizing I didn't have one until my phone beeped that it was dying. Because of this I decided I was getting chargers for every vehicle."
1,Fits as said. Places perfectly on the edge's edges
0,although I can/t figure out how to program the scanner.
-1,This didn't even last one year. Plastic part broke off and no longer charges. Also the charger would get extremely hot.
1,"I was looking for something that would charge quickly as I use my iPad all day now. I needed something that worked with Apple certified devices. This fit the bill. I have been using it since yesterday, and it works like a champ!!  The rapid charge on top I use for the iPad, the second one for my iPhone, and the third one I charged your external battery in that I will keep in my purse. Absolutely perfect!!"
-1,"I bought tone of these awhile back to help track a troubled family member's car (for actual safety reasons - no wife spying going on! ). Could not get the thing to work. Tried two SIM cards, followed the directions ( kind of hard to cipher ). Maybe one of these days someone will clue me in on how to get this thing working. I&#34;m a very technical person, btw."
-1,Bought it for the higher capacity over another brand that is less amps... this one was worse. Did not hold a charge as long as the phone itself. Would not buy again. Not as easy to take the phone in and out of the case.
1,"exchange for a review, and my nephew has wanted one. We tried another type previously and weren't happy. This one feels really high quality and has worked without flaws. It's not flimsy. The telescoping extension works great. I'm super pleased with the bluetooth capability. I do recommend this purchase."
1,exactly what i needed and it was easy to find a video tutorial online. Never go to the apple store for help.
1,fits really nice and secure
-1,"Keep Looking Elsewhere, the Kick Stand didnt last but 2 weeks and barely used it before breaking other than that same as most of the other $15 cases on Amazon."
-1,"Decorative only, too thin to be of any protection"
1,"shipped with europen plug, but bought adapter and the pack works great for my laptop"
1,"While the slide back and forth from each country or plug can be awkward from time to time, this is a great practical tool to bring along overseas.  Love that it has two USB ports and one plug.  If you have Apple products, the USB ports can sometimes be in competition.  This is a problem that I've identified with other adaptors, so not necessarily an issue with this product.  We ordered two and made daily use of them."
1,"Does the trick and is MUCH sturdier than the other kind that I ordered (also a car vent iPhone holder), which had rubber prongs that fell off within a few months."
0,"I am torn on the amount of stars I would give this product. I ordered this for my Iphone 6 plus, which I am afraid may be a tad too heavy for this product. The connection plugs nicely into my center console, however, while driving my phone will slowly make its way down until it is laying on the center console or spin around. I have tried to set it up differently but continue to get the same results. Like I said, I like the product, I just dont think it is good with the weight of the 6 Plus."
1,Colorful and works well.
1,Case was slim and not heavy but has the potential to protect your phone when it falls. I'm happy with my purchase :)
1,works great!
-1,"The Pebble Time becomes a brick two weeks after you start using it.  Pebble shipped these watches with a known defect in the charging system.  The watch will only charge one or two times, and then will stop charging altogether.  Pebble is being flooded with emails.  Support response is extremely backlogged.<br /><br />The watch does not stay charged &#34;up to 7 days&#34; as they claimed.  Three days, four tops.  Then it dies after the first or second time you charge it up.<br /><br />Pebble needs to do a recall.  Just google &#34;Pebble Time does not charge&#34;.  You will see even professional reviewers had to send for replacement cables while they were testing the Pebble.  Each reviewer though it was a one-off problem, but it isn't.  This is a serious defect affecting a large number of Pebble Times."
-1,"This product was a complete waste of money.  The screen protector is nothing more than a thin film of plastic.  It is water proof, however, it is made of very cheap brittle plastic and lacks any durability what so ever.  Mine broke in the pocket of my dress pants after only a week. I never dropped even dropped it or had a chance to take it out camping or anything.  Don't waste your money on this."
1,Works as expected. Not much more to say than that!
1,"Great case. I have my own landscaping business and have a tendency to drop my phone, run it over with a mower tire, get caught in the rain, etc. This case has protected it from everything. Took one star away because the built-in screen protector feels pretty cheap but still works."
1,"Works great, no problems"
1,"It's a good product. I do wish you could more easily use the touch screen on my phone when it's in the case,  but so far the case keeps my phone dry :)"
1,As expected.
1,I love my case! It's very durable.
-1,"It was good the first couple of days, then it turns off by itself, when I press the unlock button it takes like 30 seconds to show the unlock screen, battery drains way to fast not very happy"
1,"The magnets not the strongest, but other than that its amazing!"
1,Works perfectly
0,"didn't last long, cracked on front."
-1,Dead in 3 days....
0,Mine lasted about 5 months.... I have had several of these and they normally last a couple years.
1,Great product durable
1,"The cover under the plastic purple is a little loose on the phone, almost as if it's too big. Yet to see if this causes any problems, or is more just an annoyance."
1,Perfect fit and looks good on my stainless steel with the modern buckle of the Apple Watch.
1,excelente
1,"Great wireless charger, but I wish it would charge my phone faster!"
-1,"bad screen ,slow to touch ,faded colors started getting spots in screen after cpl weeks"
0,Purchased this back in June and left a great review.  A few months later the cable only charges the ipod classic but won't connect to the media interface to play music.. Get a message on the nav screen &#34;device incompatible&#34;. .not sure what to do...
-1,I had to rebuy and other one. it didn't sound good at all. its cheap but I wasted my money on it. I don't know why I totally forgot I could return them.
1,"I use these every time I run, and they have been fantastic. Light weight, and surprisingly good sound. I'd recommend these to any runner."
1,Great product...great fit<br />When I look at getting another I sure will look at this seller first.<br />Fast shipping
1,these super shields go on smooth and  EZ. but I really did not need 6 of them. although the price was great. I would buy them again.
1,Very convenient. Im using it a lot
1,Works great
1,Great item
1,"One word of warning.. if you upgraded a win8 computer to 8.1 you MUST find upgraded 8.1 bluetooth drivers, or unit will NOT function!  this warning should be included.  Past that, product when everything is upgraded.. sound is awesome!  product easily connects to bluetooth devices.. No complaints here!"
1,Very  colorgul snd well made.  Looks great on my phone
1,I like it
1,"Fixed a galaxy s4 for a friend's daughter.  I took my time watched numerous vids online and did i mention I build circuit boards (thru hole and surface mnt)  for over 15 yrs now.  So I am well versed with electronic repair.  The board fit perfectly.  When I was done I plugged it in and it charged fine, I made a few calls and the mic worked properly.  I ordered this board from &#34;YUE DA TIME&#34;  from Amazon and the one I got worked perfectly.  I would say though if you have never done this work before go slow, and be observant of what you are doing.  Ppl tend to rip and tear and make the situation worse before they even get the new board in.  Be sure to remove the tape because there is adhesive that needs to be secured.  The process is fairly simple if you just take your time and do it right the 1st time.  From my experiences, brute force and electronic repair do not mix well.  Thx again fixed a s4 for under $10.00"
1,Very good
1,"Best phone case/card holder on the planet. This is my second one and when I get the next generation phone, I'll get another, easy to use and offers great protection."
-1,"Two of the screen protectors were already scuffed up when I got them. Then the sticker that's on the bottom wouldn't come off. Long story short,  if you have a $700 phone don't buy $3 screen protectors."
-1,It keep falling off the windshield and it wont stick to the dash at all.  I was not at all happy with this.
1,very good
1,works great on my new phone
1,Great quality
1,Awesome product so far! Great for use at the pool where limited charging is available. Would buy again!
1,"We all have numerous electronics that require usb charging cables.  When we travel we used to have to take multiple plugs etc.  Not all hotels have power outlets in convenient locations and this solves that problem in one easy to carry item.<br /><br />As the amazon description mentions:<br />The power cord is pretty long, ( just under 5 feet) and can easily wrap around for transportation.<br />The plug has a convenient snap in spot as well.<br />It does not mention that they include a handy drawstring travel bag for the unit. (nice touch).<br /><br />So far, I have a Note 4, and an LG G watch plugged into it at night. I'll also be charging a Kindle every so often at the same time.  No issues with charging, I can not speak to the speed of the charge, as I have them plugged in all night and in sleep mode. However, I have a full charge by the time I wake (about 5 hrs later).  That is usually from a 35% charge to 100%, again I am not able to report how long that takes,, as I sleep through it.<br />This will be easy to toss in a carry-on bag for trips, or my laptop bag to and from work. I have no need for the universal plug, but who knows, maybe one day.<br /><br />I received this item for free or discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
1,"This is a very easy to install phone holder. You simply slip the small metal plate on the inside of your phone cover and attach it to the magnet on the mount. The mount itself is small and unobtrusive. I have mine attached to the windshield by suction cup, although you could similarly mount it to the dash. It's difficult to understate the convenience of this holder. You literally just place the phone in front of the magnet and it attaches on. Good for most modern smart phones."
1,I love this screen protector! I've already dropped my phone several times without any scratches or nicks!
1,"good,nice,but a littel expnesive"
1,"Not a lot to say, except that this strikes me as a very well-made item. It's sturdy, and I feel it keeps my phone safe. I'm very pleased with it."
-1,It doesn't work on my computer.  Very disappointed.
1,Works great and looks great!
1,This case is SUPER CUTE! It's HUGE And will not fit in your pocket and come with a horible smell besides that it's perfect !
1,Nice
1,Great convenient wireless charger.
1,I am so happy that I got a PROMO code to get this item and leave a fair review.
1,Great case
-1,"It is a beautiful case, but the rubber edge on the magnet flap is ripping off, the leather edges of the kiss are also breaking apart. Find another case that will last longer."
1,Good screen protection
1,"Great products, works fine"
0,"First and foremost I admit that I am super anal about taking care of my cell phone. I typically will have each one for about three years and therefore want it to last as long as possible. I just got a nexus 6 on project fi and intend for it to be my only device for quite a while. With that being said a good case and screen protector are key. This screen protector is crystal clear. The fact that it is not flexible makes it the easiest I have ever installed, dust free and aligned properly on first try. Usually not an easy feat. I am not a good reviewer for scratch resistance as I never put the phone in a situation where it can be scratched but it seems as good as any other i have ever used (typically spigen). The only issue I have with it is the fit. The cutouts are the perfect size and shape for all the phones features (speakers, sensors, etc.) but it is slightly too large to make a 100% seal. What I mean is the edges of the screen are ever so slightly curved so around 1-2 mm of the entire periphery is not stuck down to the screen. Not a huge deal for most I assume but i'm sure dust will build up in this area over time and cause me two problems. One is aesthetics, it just won't look good with all that junk under it. Two, that dust will act as sandpaper over time and start to cause a cloudy look around the edge of the screen due to thousands of microscopic scratches. This may not be an issue for some at all but it is for me. I will upload pictures when I get a chance to take them.  1 Week Edit: Still performing well in the protection aspect. Just as I had suspected there is a large amount of dust gathering around the edge of the screen protector where it is not completely stuck down. It is not just under but gathering under it and sticking out the sides making this &#34;fuzz&#34; border around the screen protector. I will still give it 3 stars because I am super anal and this probably won't bother most people but I may be looking for something different soon."
0,We have used these for years.  They work good but seem to only last about 5 years.
1,I LOVE this case!  Wish I could find more designs like it!
-1,Has a hard time getting in the charge position.  You have to make sure it sits in the lighter outlet a certain way in order for it to work.  Pain to get to work.
1,Good movie. A lot of true facts came out.
0,It's been on  my fitbit a month.  Not sure I want to keep it on as three  of the corners are peeling up.
1,"This was a great 1st time purchase experience with Amazon. this is an awesome product, from the price to the shipping time."
1,💯
1,Fit perfect and I love it.  I have ahd it for a couple of months already and it still looks new to me.
1,This made it easy to repair my broken charger door!
1,Got it for my husband he loves it!
-1,Had for 2 days and it already broke. I have bought 2-3 of these clips already. Each have broke under normal/ light use. But the price is reasonable for something so cheaply made.
1,Product is as described.
1,Loving this case so far.  Have dropped my phone several times from 3ft+ and have had no issues thus far.
1,"I LOVE this little gadget!! I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 and it fits perfectly. It clips over the top of the phone, to cover over the eyepiece. I just started experimenting with the fish eye lens (photo attached, don't judge!)  : )  -  makes a great, super affordable gift! I've given two of these away as gifts and both recipients thought their new little phone camera lens kit was the coolest thing ever. Comes with a cloth carrying bag... easily fits into a pocket or small purse compartment."
1,"i received this product in exchange for an unbiased review the shipping was fast and the package was secure and safe, no broken parts made of durable materials easy to install with clear instructions fits my Iphone 6+ perfectly doesn't interfere with the camera all ports and speakers work perfectly stylish. It is thin and lightweight but very good protector i have dropped my phone quite a few times and i also keep in a large purse, my phone is very safe and well protected"
1,"This phone is awesome for the price, the camera quality top notch, sound is loud and clear the screen is big and crystal clear. Storage space no problems, internet speed no problems I just love this phone, I shopped around for 2 weeks before I finally made my decision to purchase the Titan Max, so far I have no regrets."
1,Great product
1,Case works great essy out and in for the samsung s4 cell phone
0,"It's a good product and has apparently saved my phone many times from cracking.  However, I Believe it cracks a little too easy.  I've never dropped my phone on a hard surface, or landed it on a rock - anything that would really what I deem this much damage.  However, this screen protector does look great and protect the screen - just question its durability."
1,Very good. Love it!
1,"Fits very well and isn't too bulky.  It has just the right amount of grip without being sticky, so it'll slip into your pocket easily, but you don't have to worry about it slipping out of your hand.  Shipping was fast, too!<br /><br />If I have any gripes at all, it's just that I wished the power button was just a little more pronounced, not a big deal though."
-1,Did not fit properly
-1,case does not fit well
-1,"Good:  Works in my 2003 Civic if I plug it in, attach my phone, unplug it for 5 seconds, and then plug it back in. Bad:  Doesn't work in my 2013 Tundra at all even following the plug/unplug/plug procedure.  UPDATE:  After 7 months of use the three metal pieces on the end have fallen off.  One of them went missing so the whole thing is a loss now."
1,"So far the bands seem to work great and I have had no problems.  The only disappointment I have is I thought I would get 12 different colors, but 4 of the twelve I received are black.  I would have given 5 stars if I would have received 12 different colors."
1,There is nothing better to mount an escort/bel detector. Rock solid.
1,great product as usual
1,Good
-1,"Did not like. Felt cheap, and the cover was sticky. Could not access any of the side buttons and had to take it off almost everytime i wanted to use my phone"
1,Great nice case. It took a lot to arrive but it is a nice good looking book.
1,Forms worship to foreign countries to members of the family at this present time there was no feedback about any one of the phones are is not working so all phones are ok 4-star rating
-1,This was not the phone case that was shipped to me. The butterfly pattern is correct but the case pictured here is not what I received. The picture shows a ballistic case with raised rubberized corners. What I received was a simple plastic phone cover not what is advertised here. I am extremely unhappy with the &#34;Bait and switch&#34; that happened.
1,Works better than the POSH phones that have the &#34;same&#34; specs.
1,Needs more pockets
1,Great. Exactly as pictured.
1,"Update: they've improved the magnet quality in this substantially, making all my old complaints invalid. It is my favorite travel dock, I keep one in my with bag for whenever I rent a car. The only downside is it can be easy to forget in a car and if you rent a lot you might lose it. I'd buy more than one. Very sticky and firm, even sticks to the wireless charging coil inside of my phone eliminating the need for the metal pad being attached<br /><br />Old review: Not that great. Vibrations from the road make the phone slide around on the mount changing angle and rotation. If you don't have a case for your phone you have to apply the metal piece to the phone itself, which is undesirable, but the strength through a case is not good enough for reliable use. okay for backup in a rarely used vehicle, don't recommend as primary solution.<br /><br />Edit: Company contacted me and supplied a different phone mount, that is not magnetic but springing clamp design. It's not what I wanted but I appreciate that they tried to rectify my problem. I like this brand for other products and would not avoid them in the future because of this phone mount not being for me. Good customer service."
1,Good quality case. Took a little longer to get here than I liked but it was inexpensive but good quality
0,Kept sliding out of place and popped immediately whenever the phone was dropped.  Looks pretty but it's not very well made.
1,"Great case for my iphone 6. Its not too bulky so I can still get my phone into my pocket or purse. It doesn't add a lot of weight either, only 1.6 oz. It is properly designed so that all the holes line with the phone properly. Most importantly it is a beautiful color. This is case has extra protection on the corners for when you drop your phone. I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review.<br />Comment"
-1,"Wait till i get my hands on Nokia, Boost & whoever else has their hands in on this garbage phone. I have service through boost, on my iphone...PERFECT...on this...NEVER...even in the begginings of the month. Boost tells me it all depends what phone you buy. The 30$ ones from walmart work better than this garbage. What a waste."
-1,"Unfortunately, all 4 of them failed in 4 days. First one will not charge whatsoever although the phone says connected. 2nd one tip broke off at the base (never seen that before). last 2 ones will not charge of do anything. honestly, the worst wires I have ever bought. Be aware!"
1,Fits perfectly. Easy to hold without fear of slipping out of hands. Nice design. Highly recommend!
1,Nice  case gold is almost same color gold as the phone fits the phone perfect
-1,doesn't support iPhone or iPad
0,Does what it's supposed to...nothing too special. Grips is sturdy.
1,"Good luck getting this hooked up, they never could in my case.  Let me tell you the whole story:  Currently, it appears that Cricket is foolishly making all their &#34;Bring your own phone&#34; kits with a single nano card and separate adapters.  Well, these adapters may or may not work with your phone, making them worthless.  No place had these cards in the micro, and Cricket was clueless about this.  So I bought this one off here and crossed my fingers.  Long story short it did not work.  It would not connect via the website, so I called Cricket, and they couldn't connect it (error pps099, whatever that is, they either couldn't or wouldn't tell me), so they told me to go to the store, to which I told them the Gamestop people have absolutely no clue about these phones (they don't).  I then talked to them via online chat, and they gave me these same options, only telling me if I could go to a &#34;corporate store&#34; they might be able to get service.  Right, like I'm going to drive 2 hrs to connect up a bloody telephone. UPDATE:  Tried again and called the number 855-619-6021 (this is where you want to call!)  and got an Excellent Cricket representative (give him a raise, cricket) who walked me right through getting this hooked up and also ported over my number from my old carrier.  Up to this point (as noted above) I was ready to tear my hair out over this.  It really comes down to finding the right person who knows what they are doing.  I would give this 5 stars if not for my initial experience, so I removed one. Beware everyone, Cricket seems to have nice customer service, but they are overall the most maddening company I have yet to deal with.  They are all confused and nothing seems to work."
1,I love this product. It is very efficient. I hope it lasts for a really long time.
1,Received the package in excellent condition. The batteries have worked great so far.
1,Works great and easy to use. I now have surround sound on my TV and can hear shows over the humming air conditioner. My only gripe is that the sound from the TV doesn't sync with the Bluetooth sound in speakers so I have to mute the TV. For 20 bucks I'm happy
1,"good price , quick delivery."
1,It works as advertising.
-1,"I wanted these headphones for workouts.  I only used them for weightlifting (no high intensity cardio, etc.) and I could not keep them in.  They were a pain and I was constantly messing with them.  They may be great to watch a movie or to listen to music while stationary, but NOT while working out.  The sound was great, but they did not meet the needs of what I wanted."
1,very good
0,So far battery life is good. But found it very slippery. I bought some adhesive bumpons to put under it so it will not slip.
1,"Very happy with the product, and the additional small free gifts / accessories included.<br /><br />Was delighted when the protective case arrived a full two weeks before the estimated time of delivery"
1,great item
1,"I like this case.  A little tough to open and close the compartment at first, but it's getting better."
1,I've used this mount while traveling a number of times now and it has been very useful.  No problem attaching to air vents in car and holds strong.
1,"Product received as described, shipped quickly, and has worked well so far."
1,The product  was delivered as stated in the product description
1,Work great.
1,very satisfied
0,It does not automatically connect to my iPhone. I have to turn it off and on to get it connected. Other than that it works fine.
1,As expected good price.  Quick delivery!
1,Great
1,"I love UAG cases.  Had one for the S5 and now this one, certainly my favorite.  It's protective, but not a safe like an otterbox.  It's stylish if you like the &#34;industrial&#34; look of screws and such, it's thin, and it grips.<br /><br />Not a fan of the crap screen shields they send with the cases, though, but I certainly don't feel like they're adding unnecessary cost to the purchase."
1,Looks and sounds great will try it.
1,This is the drawer where I keep assorted lengths of wires. These cables are good quality and arrived quickly.
-1,"I just got the Edge phone a week ago and was adament on having a case to protect it.  I purchased this one and while it would fit width wise, there is no way humanly possible that this will fit length wise!!!  It is about a half inch to inch too short for the phone!  TOTAL waste of time and money"
-1,Nice picture but a flimsy material. Just for looks.
1,Good product. Fits very well and easy to switch with original band. It can get scratched pretty easy though but that's common with wear. Somehow I believed this item would come with tools to do swap out old band with this one but it didn't. That was my only disappointment.
1,Clear instructions were provided.  Great packaging and complete with all that you need for a perfect/professional installation.  I strongly suggest that you invest 5 minutes and review the installation video  ( link on packaging).  Note the tempered glass protectors are much easier to install and protect far better than the film protectors.
1,"I used this universal magnetic car mount to mount my Omaker bluetooth speaker to my dash for listening to my podcasts on the way to work in the morning. The mount comes in a nice little box with foam cut outs and extra sticky pads for both the ball and the socket/receiver.<br /><br />The socket and receiver has a really sticky reusable pad that can be removed and reused many times. The adhesive mount on the ball is more permanent but the kit comes with an extra in case you need to remove it and place it somewhere else.<br /><br />The magnet is very strong. It can easily hold my bluetooth speaker and probably something twice as heavy.<br /><br />The only constructive criticism I can give the manufacturer is I would like to see some sort of instructions included with this product, regardless of how simple it is.<br /><br />This is the bluetooth speaker I used with this:<br />[[ASIN:B00RBIC1IS [Best Outdoor&Shower Bluetooth Speaker Ever] Omaker M4 Portable Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker with 12 Hour Playtime for Outdoors/Shower (Army Green)]]<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful."
1,"I am very finicky when it comes to my phone cases. I am very hard on my phone, dropping it at least twice a day. Losing it in the bottom of my purse. Dripping water on it. You name it, I've probably done it. So I need a case that is durable and will at least protect it when I drop it or lose it. When I was offered this case at a free / reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review I decided I had nothing to lose and took the offer. That being said, this case is made of durable, high quality materials. I have dropped my phone and lost it in my purse a few times since getting this case and it has protected it better than I ever thought it would. I was very surprised with this case. The color is fabulous and it fits my phone perfectly. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone who needs a phone case."
1,Great product and so easy to install. Love it!
1,Better than the original.  The extra length makes charging much easier.
1,"Several times i have thought about throwing my Bose speakers away because none of my iPods or iPhones work on it any more (different connectors).  I am so glad i didn't because with the CoolStream i can again use this unit and not just for Apple devices.  I have used the CoolStream to stream music from my HTC One M8 and Samsung Galaxy Tab, both using Spotify.  It sounds great. And super easy to set up, highly recommended"
1,"My order just came today - earlier than expected!!! Very nice case - just as described. Only negative comment I can make is about the magnetic closure flap - it feels a bit flimsy. But overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase. Phone can be charged while still in the case. You won't be able to find a phone case like this at your neighborhood mall selling at this great price!  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010NFD0GC?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00"
-1,First off the phone never fit properly in the case. We had to jamb it all together and even then there was a gap around it. Then within a couple days the diamonds started falling out and finally the kickstand broke after about a month. It's a pretty bulky case as well.
1,"Now my mifi works,"
1,"Fits phone good husband likes it a lot. Seems to help with the outside keys as well, easier to turn sound up or down."
1,"Display is as good as the original. I own more than one of these model phones so can make a side-by side comparison. The display is just as clear, bright and colorful as the original. Touch response is identical.<br /><br />Just find and follow a You Tube guide, take your time and don't forget to remove and reuse the speaker from the old screen. I heated my speaker a little with a hair dryer and pushed it from the front and it came out with no problems.<br /><br />The tool kit is pretty cheap, but good enough to perform the replacement operation the one time you will need it. If you plan to do this type of work for a hobby or a living, you should just buy a better grade of tools.<br /><br />Start to finish, 30 minutes."
1,Fits perfectly and easy to install.
1,"Virtual partner function is excellent. Sets it apart from the lower level watches. Great interface. Easily tweaked, has like 54 potential data fields I believe. Can be used for hiking as well with its return home function. Awesome system for pacing and tracking mileage."
1,"I've only had the unit about three weeks, but during that time I've used it successfully on two trips keeping both an iPhone and gps charged.  If the unit becomes fully discharged, it takes 5 or 6 hours to fully recharge.  However, it does seem to hold a charge for several days standing idle."
1,Perfect fit and fits like a coin in tha hand!<br />The battery is really nice and it extended my battery life from 1 day to 2-3 days without charging! :)
1,"I recommend this product, it is effective and reasonably priced.  I submerged it in water with a paper towel inside and it came out dry after 30 minutes.  I even added some weight to it to make sure it was submerged.<br /><br />It is totally worth the money I paid and it is a much better deal and effective than the LifeProof case I had, which wasvery expensive and fell apart after six months and even the replacement case I received fell apart after 4 months also, so I gave up on it and bought the Accmor Waterproof case instead and I am very glad.<br /><br />I was not paid for this review, I don't know anyone associated with this product and I paid full price for the product.  The product was not given to me for free nor did I receive anything in exchange for my review but they truly deserve my recommendation."
0,"The case was in fine condition but the image is shifted and cut-off by the hole for the camera, as well as part of his feet are cut-off by the bottom."
-1,"I would recommend  buying the whole bracket with the screen in it.  It wasn't fun replacing  for the cheap glass to Crack,  in  less than a week after the install.  And the tools pictured were not with the package."
1,I am Ble to always have a few business cards on hand!!
1,Great product
-1,"This item worked great for two weeks.  I was hoping Monet was a good brand after I saw similar adapters were duds.  After two weeks, it died. It took me a while to write the review as I don't drive the Acura that much. Much promise...greater disappointment I bought another unit hoping I receive a defective unit.  The second unit failed within 10 days."
-1,Not good at all. Looked used and didn't even work? Do not buy.
1,"Perfect for protecting the iphone 6.  I was able to put my phone in with the Otter cover, perfect fit and gives you an extra sense of security to protect your  expensive cell phone."
0,Works for me :)
1,"I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase I love the design I got (bark camo) again very happy with what I got I just have two con's, its very hard to take off but does come off and the design on the back feels like one of those wash of f tatoos you'd get at a county Fair or something but I'm holding it will feel less sticky as I use it more , this case fits perfect around my glass screen protected that I bought sepretly and gave the one it comes with to my family member with the same phone but yes one again love it and would recommend to all"
1,"Can't live without my Mophie as I'm in her phone so much on calls and texting, my phone without round die around Noon. Not cool when you got an afternoon of conference calls. Now I never have my phone die, got lots if power snd only charge at night. Worth every penny."
-1,The sound quality is surprisingly bad; it gave me a headache.  I have several pairs of headphones that I paid about $10 for and they sound much better.
1,Good quality.
1,Four stars
1,it good
1,I got it early then it said I would get it and it works really good
1,"This gadget performs as expected, without a lot of unnecessary frills.  On a recent trip to Cleveland, we put it to a good test by allowing it to guide us from our hotel to the sites we wanted to visit.  Samantha generally knew what she was doing.  There were two occasions on our trip when the shortest route wasn’t the fastest; fortunately we had a paper map along as backup. “Trust, but verify,” was my wife’s verdict on Samantha.  I particularly like the feature that shows one’s elevation above sea level."
1,"love it I have to dim the light for privacy but , it works"
1,Happy with my purchase. I recomended.
-1,cheap!
1,"Works great, what else can I say?"
1,It's perfect
1,This Qi charger works great at a fraction of the cost of the OEM brand.  I've yet to be disappointed by Anker.
1,Best non-Apple chargers ever.
1,I have not got to use it as of yet . I know that it is a quality radio . I'm working on my ham license .My Elmer told me that it was a good mobile radio
0,I don't really like the pull-out for the charger or the earphone love the texture tho and the card case only holds 2 without the worry of it popping open.. I do like it tho. I just have more cards then that so I ordered another probably use this for when I only need to carry 2 cards!!
0,"It's okay because of the length only, that part is nice.  But, it is really slow in charging your phone, takes a full 8 hours to charge to 100%, maybe, or more.  But, if you need a long cord while your power is down and you have a convenient wall plug, this will allow you to get further from it and use your phone.  I'm thinking like charging stations where you have one guy sit right in front of all the plugs."
1,Awesome band. Good quality
1,Great case but a little awkward to handle when making or receiving calls.
1,Worked perfectly.
1,"I have tested this unit for a month or so and it has out preformed every dash-cam system I've tested to date. This system requires a micro USB card to operate (record and still shots), which was no big deal for me, as I had an extra. You will need to download an proprietary app to run this camera system. Using this app you set up the camera. I started my test indoors with plugging the unit into a USB power brick. If you don't put the micro USB card in as soon as you power it up it will beep continually until you do. The first major hurdle to setting the camera is to connect to the camera's wifi server. It took about 5 attempts before successfully connecting the phone to the camera.  As soon as the connection is made you can the easily navigate the app and see live streaming of the camera's view. You can then pare up the small remote button that comes with this camera. The button allows you to activate still shots or record. This remote is key to operation as it allows for quick operation of the camera. Once your camera is up and running you can see the awesome quality of the video stream. It is an adjustable stream, so you can dial it into a perfectly clear faster stream rate. I used this camera in just about every setting, I went with 1080p as that offered the clearest field of view.  I took it outside and mounted it in my Lincoln SVU. It wouldn't suction behind the mirror as it has those small black dots made into the windshield, so I had to lower mine, so it is in your field of view while driving.  You should know your states laws about driving with something stuck in the field of view because this may get you a ticket if it is considered an obstruction.  Once I got it to suction on to the windshield, I then made a connection to the power port in the SUV.  I left my cord dangling as I determined that you need to unplug it after use, my unit didn't disconnect from the power like it should have, not a big deal, but something to note. I think is more related to the fact that my power ports don't shut off when the vehicle is turned off.  If you car or truck shuts down the ports you should have no issue with mounting this as a permanent fixture. The first time is operated this camera I had my wife drive as I operated the camera using the app. You can watch the live feed and take still shot from the cell phone app too. Once you are outside the camera's wifi reception area you can only review previous clips and still shots taken. Once you reconnect to the camera's wifi you can then view what was recorded when you are away from the vehicle. The camera has a green and blue light on the back side facing you that stay on while in use, on of them is a constant light, the other blinks. This may bother some people especially for night time driving, but it didn't affect me. The suction cup has stayed in place even in extreme heat, as of yet no cold weather testing has been available. I will update to let you know if weather changes effect the ability to stay on the windshield.  This is an easy to use and operate system that allows you to view the camera footage without taking out the micro USB card. If you remove it and place it into a adapter then you can easily use it with you computer to view and save shots or videos. For me to post a video I need to take this stream and convert it, so I will post that as well.fact that my power ports don't shut off when the vehicle is turned off.

1,Excellent
1,Perfecto
-1,They are junk!
1,I love my new phone case! I wanted the security of an Otterbox Defender but unfortunately they don't make many with nice designs on them (only different colors) so I was really happy to find this one from TrekCases. It's a genuine Otterbox case and they've added the design beautifully.. I'm pleased with my purchase and will buy from this seller again!
1,"Item arrived as promised and in great condition.  This item works wonderfully, very pleased with purchase.  I would purchase other items from this seller."
-1,"Wish it had a hole for the back camera while its flipped open. Edit: I realized the reason my phone was not getting connectivity properly to my wifi was due to this case. After I took off the case, I had absolutely no problems. However, with the case, I had issues staying connected to wifi."
0,I am so gad that you had a battery for my phone.  The battery works fine no problems at all.  Thank you.
-1,Pressing the button would not take a picture. I tried it with two phones. The directions said to download the Camera 360 app if the stock camera app didn't take a picture when the button was pushed. I downloaded Camera 360 but the button still didn't operate the camera. Needless to say I was very disappointed and returned it.
1,It feels very resistant to impact. I just hope it doesn't turn yellow over time.
0,"The Stock A-V85 antenna on my UV-82HP performs better than this one, but this antenna definitely fits the bill if you are wanting a flexible antenna."
0,I would like to know if anyone else gets a single beep when starting your vehicle? It lasts for a second tops. Only beeps once when starting my car.
0,Good!
1,Working  great I would recommend this product
-1,Is not genuine. Korean imitation!!
-1,Worked for a day then simply stopped responding to touch. Day three the screen went black and never came back on
1,"Originally purchased it for use as a PC microphone that I could use without having to wear a whole headset. It worked well but I was limited by the battery life (about 3 hours) so didn't work well for longer gaming sessions. I wasn't too upset because it was only a few bucks. Now I use it while I ride my bike to college. Totals about 2 hours a day. I listen to music from my phone. It works well for this because it allows me to keep one ear open for situational awareness, and also because of how it is nestled in your ear it makes it very difficult to fall out. It sometimes causes me irritation if I wear it for too long, usually over 2 hours at once. But that is uncommon and very bearable when it does happen. I could not reccommend this earpiece more. It is very discreet and I have used it while working (at a bar) to listen to music and very few people noticed it. If you aren't sure about this earpiece I would say you should at least try it. For a few dollars it very well may surprise you."
-1,"This watch is a great idea BUT!  It took a full afternoon of repeated attempts to get the watch connected.  It was cool for 2 weeks then for no reason, the watch disconnected.  I repeatedly tried to connect.  Uninstalled and re installed the watch manager many times.  There is no responsive customer service from Meta Watch.  I do not recommend this watch.  It has been a great disappointment."
1,"Works as expected. Good product, great price."
1,Great picture quality
-1,Watched their installation video and followed the isntructions but  air bubbles don't go away even witha  squegee.  Used 2nd protector. same thing.<br />I've used a few other screen protector brands and this has to be the worst!
1,Perfect fit for the back pocket on a pair of standard men's Levis jeans! Stick one of these in your pockets when you're out and about and traveling and put your cell phone in the other pocket and you're now walking around with more than twice the battery capacity you had before. If your phone is slim enough this charger pack will even fit in your pocket so you can charge on the go.<br /><br />There are a lot of cheaper products out there but this one is definitely the thinnest and lightest one for the price point.
1,Delivery was fast and product met my expectations
-1,won't fit
1,I love my Argon Technologies Bluetooth Wireless speaker. Its seemlessly connects to my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and my iPad. The sound coming from this little device is large and clear. Great product for the price.
1,"Great product, this shield is much cheaper then anything anywhere else and works just as well!"
1,good product
1,Cheaper than apples and works just as nice.
1,"Nice case, fits the iPhone 6 with Spigen Slim Armor Case perfectly."
1,"Best case I've ever bought, thats saying a lot! Fit and finish are outstanding. Quality build and protects the phone like it should."
-1,"Bought it and stuck it in the car port, but did not use it for months.  Then discovered that it will not power up an iPad or iPhone.  Too late to return.  Oh, well, live and learn."
-1,These are absolute junk. Pay whatever extra money and get something that fits your I-pad. By the time you cut these to fit. you have a sharp edge on the sides that catches on everything. Pure and simple trash!!!
1,Like them but would not go out of my way to order them again. They are to worry. They don't lend themselves to being put away!
1,"perfect in every way. Charges with no problems. It does take some time to charge this unit, but it charges phones and ipad very fast."
1,"I like that there are two options to secure the armband since I'm slim and was worry it wouldn't fit my smaller arm. But it did. The touch screen still works under the plastic cover. :) The slot for the earphone was open and easy to locate. It was also easy to insert your phone inside and pull the cover tab over to protect it. There's even a little slot to place one key inside. Only thing is that I did feel a little sweaty underneath it, even thought it was suppose to be sweat-resistant. But overall very good product. The armband did what it was suppose to do and stayed in place while I run at the gym.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest review."
1,Easy setup. Nice design and I like the added led lights while phone is charging. Charges phone about as fast as standard charger. I drain the battery nightly and simply place my phone on top before bed and wake up to a fully charges phone. Cheaper than some other 3rd party chargers and more visually pleasing in my opinion. Great buy.
1,The cable is the Samsung OEM cable and works perfectly.
1,"Anker makes excellent 3rd part products for all mobile devices.  They are my first choice of manufacturer, cable was 10 feet long, is thick and sturdy and works well.  Can't ask for much more"
-1,"Works only one month, even worst than Apple OE."
0,"Packaging was almost non-existent, very cheap. Color was a lot brighter than expected as well. Cover itself seems very flimsy. It fit my phone okay, just doesn't feel like my phone is protected very well. If you are looking for just a case with minimal protection, this one fits the bill.<br /><br />*I have received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.*"
-1,"Complete waste of money. Took forever to ship, opened the package and it was thin, flimsy, and bent out of shape. (There was no way an iPhone would stay in there, but what should I expect I guess)<br />On top of that there was a tear in it! I contacted them to return it, and they said they needed a picture, I sent it. Did I hear a response?NOPE! Don't waste your money please! You worked too hard for that dollar!"
0,"So far it is what it says it is. My biggest complaint is that this &#34;2-pack&#34; only comes with enough to apply once. So after you use the supplied application tools you are left with only a glass screen to put on with no tools. Im not sure if I got a bad box or if they are just cutting corners to save money. Either way, it was easy to put on. Instructions are easy enough to follow. Biggest complaint is not being able to have tools to put on the second screen. I plan to use scotch tape when the time comes. I tried to save the tools supplied by reapplying them to the paper they came on but not sure if thatll work. The blue dust screen I feel is not going to hjold up. They should have supplied at least two of them."
1,Excellent customer service and product.
1,Another great case from elago.
1,Fast shipping. Very good fit! Even come with a little key chain flashlight.
1,Great
1,great
1,"The case is colorful but does not come with a strap. The hole is there but no strap for it. I was expecting it to have one. No biggie, just an FYI."
1,This doesn't work on my phone (Galaxy 3) due to some idiotic thing that Samsung added with the last update. It works like a champ on my husband's phone.
1,I'm very happy with this.  I got tired of all the cables laying around.  This cleans up the clutter and they work great.
1,Products as described and arrived very fast
1,Fantastic product. Works beautifully for beach bumming and long camping trips if you need your iPhone. 
1,You get what you pay for. Very cute though.
0,It's really nice and super light weight but breaks easily mine cracked the 2nd day
-1,If you like looking at a dust ring on your screen by all means buy it. The fact that they left the circle hallow is a fail. A thin sheet of plastic on the circle would of made the case perfect.
1,Convenient and protective.
-1,The item was damaged and I couldn't send it bcck
0,Just received my LG Tone Pro Bluetooth Headset (HBS-750).<br /><br />Was fully charged and paired with my Samsung Note 3 easily right out of the box.<br />CONS:<br />- The plastic is glossy and shows smudges and fingerprints.<br />- Can't use while charging.<br /><br />So far so good. Can't wait to fully test them.
1,good protection
1,"Super happy with this little demon. Cranks power and blows our old USB charger away. Also, it has two ports, which is perfect for our busy, phone greedy family. We always seem to have one or more charging in the car. Very thankful for this well made, efficient gadget with streamlined design, compact size, manufactured with good quality sturdy components. It was delivered quickly, with no harm, because it was packed well in a strong pvc casing. Seems like a very dependable high quality item. I was very lucky to receive this lightening fast usb charger at a great discount, but my reviews are always honest, and I take care reviewing and testing products. I have no reason to make false claims or compliment a product I don't believe in. This one is no exception and I highly recommend. Peace out."
0,has anybody found this case for an iphone 6 plus? and help would be appreciated.
-1,Does not fit Samsung s5
1,My problem is the battery..it gets easily dead.
-1,"They are really long yes, which is convenient. However, after about a months' nightly use my first one has stopped working. I keep getting an error that tells me 'this device is not supported'"
-1,"bad quality,cannot cover the screen,easily dirty."
1,it was great and sounds good.
1,This is a perfect phone to buy if your on a budget or not.
-1,You get what you pay for... it broke the 2nd day I had it
1,I'm happy with the cable.
0,Nice cover for the back but doesn't do anything to protect the front.
1,I bought this because I've recently started working on a building site and didn't want my phone getting clogged up with dust and dirt. But I also work in a bar and decided to test the ruggedness of the waterproofness(?). So I decided to put some paper in it and put the case through the dishwasher there and the case came out unscathed and the paper as dry as it should be. I am perfectly happy with this case
-1,Sux that this took like a month to come in and it doesn't fit
0,Meh...the color is not so great but I only use this for the club when I need my ID and cell phone handy. It'll do for now but I woudln't recommend the gold case. It def has more of a blah brown to the majority of the case...only the pocket is a pretty gold color.
1,great one i like it
-1,"This stuff was pretty bad.  It worked great for the first week, and we had read about the wire shorting out in other reviews, so were careful, but it shorted out pretty quick and became rather touchy as to whether or not it would work, depending on the day or the weather or what the heck ever.  Now it only works out of one speaker sometimes, so we're definitely going to look for a different one."
-1,Good case but takes awhile to charge back up and makes a whining sound while charging the battery pack back up.
1,great speakers. was really shocked by  the sound considering the price
1,"It gets kind of blurry on the edges of the picture when I use the wide range lens but I didn't expect it to be 100% perfect given its not that expensive.  Overall, I really like the product. I would definitely recommend it."
-1,These headphones lasted about a week before shorting out. If I could give them a zero that would be my honest rating.
-1,"This was OK at first, but after 4-5 uses of 1-2 hours each, the right ear bud does not work. I really expected a better build quality from these. My kids' wired earbuds from the dollar store have lasted longer."
1,"Great phone.  This was an upgrade from S3mini, and it meets all needs, except one important one.  Kitkat operating system does not allow 3-rd party apps to write to the SD card, so it is not possible to use ES explorer or other apps to move files from PC to phone without plugging the phone into the PC.  This is a significant downgrade in capability, and I may have to root this phone to fix it.  I will wait till it is out of warranty to try, before I do."
1,"I loved it, perfectly fit for my phone."
1,Bought this case for my husband. So far it has worked like a charm. He likes it a lot and has no complaints.
1,Love the color and smoothness of the case!!!
1,Daughter loves it.  She picked it.
1,"Love it, It's work with Galaxy note 5. It say fast charging when you plug it in. It take about 1 and a half hour to fill it to up from 5-100%. But it dose not work with my Sony z3."
1,Great product and works great.
-1,Plastic piece holds phone on top and bottom. Cracked the first week.
1,Great
-1,"This is weird....it does not fit my HTC1, Its to small."
1,"Flashy, flashy, flashy!!!  I was looking for a bit of flash and this case has it.  The case holds my phone perfectly.  It is easy to grip.  Great price for a very nice case."
1,I like this case.  It's slim and protects the HTC M8 fairly well.  Looks really good on the phone and feels good in hand.  The only negative is that the silicone piece fits really loose.  The could have made it a little tighter on the side but it's not an issue once you have it on.
-1,"first time i &#34;tried to attach&#34; the legs, the base broke into many sharp pieces resulting in a large cut in the palm of my hand"
-1,"Very disappointed with this product. The screen protector was supposed to fit the phone perfectly but instead I ended up having to cut it down as it was 1/4&#34; too wide on both sides, not to mention that none of the pre-cut holes really lined up either. I ended up using all 3 before I got it even close to the size it was supposed to be and looking decent."
1,"Great deal. Didn't realize this came with 3 screens when I got it, which was a nice surprise. The screen was nearly fool-proof for applying cleanly and perfectly aligned with all the hand tools included. There's a link to the video instructions to make the application easy to understand. Recommend this product"
1,Exact item needed and received.....<br />Quick shipping and inexpensive!
-1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY... THE PINK FADES INTO THE WHITE VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
1,"The SoundBot SB735 is a really nice headset. Firstly, in the box you get the headset, then you get a black box which contains a USB a user manual and lastly smaller ear tips. Now the headphones themselves feel very high quality. You have the back, forward, and pause and play on one side. Then on the other you have the volume up, down, and the button to pick up calls. Other then that there is a flap on the left side which has a usb port you can use to charge the device. The ear pieces are magnetic so if you hold them by the end of the body they automatically go in their holder. These magnets are pretty strong and don’t let the earpiece hang loose unless you want them to. They fit nicely into your ears and there are different eartips provided to fit your ear. These are very comfortable as you don’t even feel like they are on. You can even lay down with these and you won’t feel as though they are there. These are very easy to connect to your device as you turn them on then you turn on the bluetooth on your device and then click on the name of the headset and your done. As for range these are great you can be around 25 to 30 feet away from your device and these will work great. The microphone on these is really good and produces crystal clear audio. You can clearly hear the person and there is no audible static in the audio. As for what you hear these are great the sound is really good and clear. You will have no problem hearing the person when using these. If you want to use these for music they are good too. I would place them right above your average headphone, like something that you might get with your phone. These have great bass, so if you are someone who listens to bass heavy music these are great. As for battery life these last a long time you get around 10 hours of battery life if you use them non-stop, but if you use them lightly you can last a couple of days. For a price of just under $20 these a great buy and they sound amazing."
1,Nice case for a low price
1,Great buy
1,Perfect case for my new phone
1,This case holds up to all Maxboost says it does. I was very impressed. Far surpassed my expectations!
1,Exactly as described! ! Fit the phone great.
1,"Great product, packaging is on point and includes lots of extras to install it."
1,"Very good,<br />I bought one before and is excellent, thats was the reason because i bought another to gift"
1,"[[ASIN:B00VH8L1U2 Anker [Apple MFi Certified] PowerDrive Lightning 12W iPhone Car Charger with 3ft Lightning Cable for iPhone 6s / 6 / 6 Plus / 5s / 5, iPad Air 2 and more - Retail Packaging - Black]] So far, it works well. But having been stung a few times by car chargers that fail after a few months' use, I am going to wait for at least six months before waxing eloquent about this product."
-1,"After two weeks, the battery is no longer recognized by my phone (no error message just does not recognize). Boo-hiss. Very disappointing."
1,Great price!  Fast shilling!
1,"Came super fast (about 3 days) and is exactly what I expected, definitely recommended :)"
1,great fact replacement speaker thank you
-1,Tried all 3 charger wires. One of them never worked! And the other 2 only worked for about 3 days each.
-1,"Awesome delivery, fast and received as described and few extra things.  Thanks<br /><br />However case screen cracked within a month.  Booooo"
-1,Mine broke in a couple of days.
-1,Complete junk. Didn't last a full day before the clip came apart and the case doesn't fit the phone.
-1,"Within the first 2 hours, I had to re-pair with my bluetooth headset 12 times.... just sitting, no movement.  The last time it dropped, I turned it off, reseated all of its connectors, started the pairing and got only static.... now the dang thing doesn't even pair. Another example of worthless Chinese manufacturing."
-1,"This is nothing like what you see in the picture. It looks and feels very cheap, especially when it comes to color. There is nothing &#34;gunmetal&#34; about it. However the case does fit the phone perfectly and the buttons feel good, except the spacing will take a bit getting used to."
-1,"Never could get it to work, 2 weeks still not working, Instruction sheet SUPER SMALL ,written by someone who has never had to install one"
-1,Only the mouse worked on me... Keyboard won't work...
-1,Didn't work well. We had to return it.
-1,No one can here you during phone calls.
-1,"Charge cuts in and out, charger is less than a month old."
1,Love the band  exactly like the apple sport band without the high price will purchase all colors received very quickly.
1,"Great quality, no tangle, work great for phone calls. Love the color! I'd recommend for someone who wants a great pair at a great price."
1,"this was a gift for a friend of mine, she says she likes it, the delivery came in a day and a half."
1,Lots of standby power and very comfortable and well made.
1,This case fits like a glove. The phone sits in the case like it is supposed to and it doesn't feel flimsy or anything. The rubber part of the case gives a better feel on the phone and helps with the grip while the plastic part helps with the protection.
1,Very good product only missing a screen cover
1,It looks soooo good on my phone. I get complements on it all of the time.
0,"Purchased it for my wife's new 6 Plus and although she loved it, the &#34;bling&#34; started to come off shortly after she started using it.  The plastic cover is strong, much like any other plastic cover you see.  However with it being in her purse the majority of the time, I believe that caused the bling to to start coming off."
1,"I just got this case.  It's great looking, fits my phone perfectly and has a solid grip.  This is the nicest phone case I've ever had."
-1,"The sound is good, the microphone is horrid. Everybody I call say that the sound is muffled. Would not buy for phone use."
1,"Its prefect for my galaxy 4 , just fit in"
1,Good piece
1,Great case does as it should!
1,Cover fit well and I was able to use the phone without a problem.
-1,"Don't buy no matter how pretty you think it is. This case is flimsy, the edges don't snap shut like they should to lock it in place. The case is heavy too. I loved my old casemate case for my iphone5 but this case was a big disappointment."
1,waterproof
0,Seems to work ok. I do seem to have to re-pair every time I use it so that is a hassle but once paired it works great. I use a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.
-1,Stopped working after 10 uses approximately
1,The product is ok but I don't like the fact that it says USA Seller and it came from China!  I think Amazon needs to watch this more!
0,"Fixed my broken screen on my s3, but slowly began letting dust and pocket lint in under the screen. Had to let it go after two months. Make sure to get the 3m tape!"
1,Works really well. Good purchase. Fast shipping.
1,"Exactly what I was looking for and got it quick.  Great customer service and exactly the product I needed.<br />Thanks, Jim"
1,I love this case. Does not add weight to the phone. It is not bulky. Does provide some protection if dropped. Understand not Ottabox level of protection but I personally do not need it.
1,"My old battery would not keep a charge...at all...I ordered this one, my husband & I watched a video on how to replace it & my husband replaced the battery. Now my phone works great! It is a little complicated to change battery, lots of little parts...be sure to watch the videos!"
0,doe not keep up well
0,"Doesn't work with Windows Phone, but works great with Android"
1,Great!
1,This cord works as well as my apple cords do.
1,Very nice.
1,Perfect wall charger for iphones!  Would buy again.
1,"Hubby and I purchased these to help get us focused on becoming more active.  We were disappointed to discover they do not communicate with Hubbies blackberry or even our samsung tablets, but my S5 works great with them.  Downfall of that is Hubby has to wait until he is home from work to enter all his food and see his progress.<br /><br />I do like that we have a team of others using Jawbone, so we are able to encourage each other and hold each other accountable when we stop following our activity goals.<br /><br />We all had a hiccup this past weekend when the server didn't appear to be tracking properly.  According to my Up I didn't take a single step until 2 pm, but I was up and walking by 10 am that day on a beautiful winery tour.  Our whole team had similar issues that day.<br /><br />Otherwise, neat little product."
1,"Excellent phone! I am using it as a tablet (no phone service) and it's much better than tablets, unless you need a larger tablet to double as a laptop. The size is perfect for my stocky hands, and at less than 5 ounces, it beats even a small tablet, like Fire HD 6, which weighs over 10 ounces. The screen size is the same as iPhone 6 Plus, and for a good reason. Anything bigger than this would be awkward to carry around. The sim card from my defunct tracfone (LG840G, which is not even an Android phone) works in my POSH. It just sees it as a new sim. Of course, if you want to have a cellphone service, you will have to purchase a sim from a service provider (AT&T, T-Mobile, Straight Talk, etc). The screen resolution (1280x720) is quite adequate for all practical purposes; it comes out to about 267 ppi. So far (after a couple of weeks of usage) I would highly recommend this phone, if you want an Android phone (or a small tablet). Note: if you intend to use it only as a tablet, then turn on the airplane mode, so it won't be constantly searching for a cell signal, as it will drain battery. Then turn the WiFi on (in this order)."
1,"Bought this wallet for my fiance,  she loves it!"
1,excellent product!
1,"Your case..product is perfectly fine. However I'm returning since it doesn't fit my husband's phone, even though it looks (on Amazon site) like it should."
1,I have been using these on my Vivofit 2 for months now. I basically never take my vivofit off and have put it through some pretty tough situations--the display still looks brand new. This is cheap insurance and if you have a vivofit you NEED these.
1,Loves it
1,I've had a couple of screen protectors for my Note 4 and this is the best so far.  It does have a gap around the edges but that is necessary due to the curvature of the screen
1,"Best thing I have ever bought on here.  Used hundreds of times.  Saves my life on road trips. Fits ipad perfectly, easy to adjust and mount.  Very easy to use.  Great value!"
1,Kept my phone dry and damage free while working in the Everglades. Very happy with this purchase.
1,Battery works great.
-1,Great thought however it doesn't fit perfectly. I had to use pliers to remove from my phone.
1,work really well in Haiti...charging all I need
1,I love it no problems no complaints.
-1,The unit did not work!
1,"It came earlier than I thought, which is good. It's a very cheap price but the quality is actually really good. It came as it said it would, it's nice and soft and well, clear 😂 I recommend to buy this case if you'd like."
1,Love it !
1,"Worked as needed, arrived with all parts as advertised.  Arrived on time.  No issues."
1,"Great headphones, so easy to use"
1,Works very good !!
1,I have an otter box and this case fits very tight.
1,Great phone! I'm a month into using it and am really loving:<br />how it runs on lollypop<br />the camera and light gestures<br />the battery life ( I usually have &#62;50% battery left by the end of a moderate use day)<br />the voice control.
1,It fit my phone it came right away it has chargers  and stuff
-1,"It has quick charging for all those power users with compatible phones but it started to smell like if it was burning, it got extremely hot and almost burned my hand when i unplugged it."
1,This phone is out of my hand but it's working and the person who receive it is loving it no complain no problem man
0,It works
1,Great Bluetooth works good
1,"Bought 2 of these as they work very well. If/when I lose or put it through the washing machine, I'll repurchase the same one again."
1,"The car mount is easy to attach and release, and once the phone is affixed to the mount, it seems pretty secure - it hasn't fallen off.  However, the combined weight of the phone and the mount tends to close the vent."
1,"Just beautiful!!! These are so pretty and handy!! I can carry my phone, credit cards, ID and cash and I dond have to carry anything else!!  Perfect!!!!  I received a discount on this item for an honest review."
1,Great
1,"Love this cord, works great with my iphone 6, gives a fast charge and is entertaining to watch!"
1,"Really enjoyed this case! The quality is good and the color is nice, but the purple shade is a little bit different in person. Other than that, everything is great! The only thing that would make this better is if it had a wrist strap."
1,"This thing is pretty cool, and keeps getting cooler.  The dev team behind it is quite active, adding functionality often.  It takes a bit to get used to, and there are still some quirks, but almost everything is configurable through a simple GUI, so you don't need a dev background to put limiters on The Force.  My amputee friends from the military love that this technology is being developed on a more commercial basis, and hope that use of such devices will not remain a novelty, but become mainstream.  I have to admit, I'm almost to the point in Outlook where reading my email with this thing is faster than my keyboard.  Which means it's almost ready for mainstream.  I think the price tag is worth it, and I think the configurability from the GUI allows anyone to really love this thing within a few minutes of putting it on.  I have to say, it was a cool reaction I got in my first meeting where I made a fist and a blue pointer showed up on the wall screen to underscore the service flow I was trying to demonstrate.  I was wearing a long-sleeved shirt, so everyone was looking for a device attached to my computer, and couldn't.  It was great."
1,Great product. it fit and was easy to install
1,I do not have nething negative to say about my purchase it came quick which that was a plus
-1,Dissapointed in this product. Really cheap and I am going to have to buy another case. I do not recommend this product. I do not have any problems with the seller.
1,Product is exactly what I wanted!!
1,I'm  very happy with it.
1,"Best $10 ever spent! I initially had issues with pairing it with my older iPhone, but thanks to some reviews on Amazon and great response from customer service I had the headphone on paired with all devices! :) I used it 9-5 every day and it is awesome! Couldn't be happier - perfect for long calls or Skype!"
1,"I absolutely love this case. I ordered one for my husband and when I saw the quality of his I had to have one for myself as well. It fits the phone like a glove and I believe it will do a great job of protecting it. My husband dropped his on concrete and not only did it protect the phone, but there was not a scratch on the case either! I ordered the blue/black and it looks awesome. Also, I have not found that the flash on my camera turns my pictures the color of the case as some people said. And the screen protector seems to be very good quality, not cheap and plasticy like some said; I can't even tell it's there. I honestly like this case better than otter box. Would highly recommend it."
1,Love it
1,excellent - a little pricey but looks and works great
-1,"The case is nice but when I received it, it was broken"
-1,Broke within a month...
1,I love this!  Keeps all the cords and devices well organized!
-1,I bought this charger for my move across the country and it worked well for the week I used it every day. I have used it maybe 3 times since then and now it doesn't charge my devices. I tested the cable and cigarette lighter with another charger and they both worked so I knew it was the charger. not really worth returning at this point but still disappointed with the quality as my $5 gas station charger has somehow outlasted this one.
1,i love it
1,"I purchased this at a discounted price, during a promotion, for my honest and unbiased opinion. I got this for my daughter as a joke. She loved it so much but doesn't keep it on her phone all the time. Her job wouldn't be to pleased to see the language on the case. However, she does put it on when she's out and about. The iPhone 6 Case fits perfect and easy to put on and take off. My daughter is obsessed with phone cases, she has one to match all her outfits, mood or purse. So having this one that's fun is perfect for her because she can take it off easily. It doesn't crack like some of the other cases she has. So when she is in a kidding mood she puts this one on, plus black matches everything. I recommend this iPhone 6 Case from YouVogue"
1,Love it
1,"Cute, but doesn't come up around sides to protect front if dropped."
1,The best case ever
1,Exactly as described.  Went on easily.  No glare and has protected phone perfectly.
1,Worth it. Everyone needs this!
1,"It really looks like the picture, I recommended :D"
1,"Wife and daughter use one of the larger battery power banks, that are good for 3-4 charges, but size is a pain to lug around.  I wanted something smaller in size and weight, just good enough for one charge.  This power bank fits the bill, have already put to use a couple times when sightseeing and smartphone was running low after many pictures, googling for maps, and other uses.  Easy to recharge, extremely satisfied."
-1,I hate it. It looks good but while trying to put it on my phone it wants to reset my phone to factory settings or down load something that I don't even want or need. I can't get it on my phone completely without problems.
-1,front cover broke off right after opening item.  Gave as a gift.  Very disapointing!
1,"It's pretty great, fit's perfect. It was a bit difficult to get on though and the top isn't completely closed it looks like because of how hard it was to put on the case."
1,Awesome thank you fast shipping
1,It´s the best phone ever
1,Like it so far. I didn't get to try it in the shower yet.
1,"easy to use for seniors, even for fat fingers.  SOS button works well (my 2 year old accidentally used it!)"
1,I love it.
1,Remember Matthew 7:21
0,The only problem I have with this is item is pin that holds the clamp to the the case keeps sliding out of the clamp. I have caught it three times.
1,great holder for my iPhone 5s.  Just what I was looking for - to use MapmyRide on my bicycle trips.  My phone is already in a shock proof case and fits nicely in this holder.
-1,Piece of junk do not buy this radio....ive had it in my car for a month and a half and the screen stopped working i want my money back
0,Product comes with one major flaw - the edges are not rounded. This causes a problem in three areas:<br />1. The home key is nestled deep down and does not naturally taper off. This (in myopinion) is uncomfortable and makes touch ID less impactful<br />2. It is difficult to put on a case that will comfortable fit with the tall edges at the end of the screen. (Two cases - both Spigen and different models - did not fit correctly because of this.<br />3. The 'swipe up feature is incredibly frustrating to use because of the added thickness. It worked for me about 33% of the time
1,Love this phone.  I have owned 3 and will probably buy again.
1,Very good substitute for otterbox.  It is more streamlined but seems to give the same type of protection for a fraction of the price.
-1,"did not fit phone, un usable...waste of money"
1,This case is amazing! It is light weight and protects my phone. The built in screen protector is very clear. I am buying this brand for all my families phones.
1,Great case. Would definitely buy again from this seller.
1,Very good
1,great!
0,had to use a bandsaw to trim the clamp so it would close fully on a standard boom style microphone stand.
-1,It work thanks
1,Great value and they really dont tangle up!
1,"Everything went well, fits great, improved touch on the screen."
1,"the stick is amazing. works perfectly with my iPhone 6 and love the button on the handle, it's really cool, i love this selfie stick! Great price aswell."
-1,"I liked having a device that monitored my sleeping patterns and daily steps everyday but unfortunately, the UP 24 was just not designed properly. The small cap/mode button fell out after 3 months and once that happened the silver cap with the Jawbone logo wouldn't go back on properly. I contacted Jawbone and they sent me a replacement and guess what? The same thing happened almost 3 months to the day as well! I'm so over this wristband, its just poor design. In addition, this 2nd replacement wristband its silver cap started scratching my wrist and gave me a bad rash. I took very good care of both wristbands, never getting them wet so I can only imagine how much worse it would have been if I wasn't so careful with it. It's a shame, that they would continue to sell this model and allow people to waste their hard earned money. I'm looking into the Fitbit now."
1,👍🏻
1,Works beautifully with my iPad and also my iPhone
0,IIt’s sturdy and protects well against fall but mine arrived scratched and the design chips off pretty easily even on your pocket. .<br />I keep mine because it was going to be used on a construction site so it was going to get scratch anyway. If you are looking for a case that look good for regular use this one is not the one.
1,Love it! Works great for iphone once I downloaded the software.
1,Great
1,"I absolutely love the JoyGeek Bluetooth shutter remote! This button is perfect for me. I review on Amazon, obviously. With this button I can create review videos with ease! The button hooked up to my iPhone 6 with no problems. And, it's so easy to use! All you have to do is go to your camera app, smile and push the button. If your going to do a video, it's the same process! I love how fun and easy this product is to use. I was sent the shutter button to test out and review. It is such a helpful product! I no longer have to reach across to cut my videos off. I am so thankful for this product!"
-1,It only works for a few months but you can't beat the price!
1,Great case and fits amazing looks great to. Very fast shipping
1,Perfect fit and easy to install
1,My products are good !! Thanks
1,Best case ever
1,The touch/feel of this protector is better than Apple's own glass coating.
0,"It was okay, scratched really bad and really easy to peel off."
1,"Great! This stand is sturdy and does exactly what I need it to do. Fits my iPad Air 2, and my iPhone 6+ even in an Otterbox case. I use it mainly to hold my phone landscapewise at night as an alarm clock. 10/10 would buy again."
1,The speaker & microphone work well. The head band is a little long and fails to firmly hold everything in place.
-1,To big want stay in ear.
1,Best iem's I've ever had.
1,"I love how simple it was to install and I appreciate how well it holds my phone.  My last car phone holder required that I place it in some arms that then clicked to hold it tight.  It was a pain to grab my phone.  Basically, putting it in or taking it out of the holder was a pain.  Not the case here.  It's a powerful magnet and you simply place your phone on it and it stays there.  Then when you want to grab it, it just comes with you when you grab it.  I did receive this product as part of a product promotion, but now that I've been able to try it out, I'm ready to buy another for my other vehicle!"
1,"I didn't even know extension cables existed until I was offered this one for review.  It's perfect when you just need a little bit more length.  It works great, phone charged fine.  You plug this into your phone cord to give it a few more inches.  It's great.<br /><br />I was offered a sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review."
1,It's good..
1,"This phone is awesome, ive had allot of phones but this one is by far the best ive ever had, i owned the nokia 1020 and K zoom cause the camera on a phone is the most important feature, i loved both of those phones but this one is far better, the video's this phone produces are beautiful, if you were to buy this phone just for being a camera you will be extremely pleased, also the specs are good enough to play any game the android market has available, also the body of this phone is very nice, removable back plate for swapping battery, and metal frame are awesome, only negatives with this phone are no memory card slot and no optical stabilization. If you wish to see the video quality for yourself click the link below for my youtube channel.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnWW7mkP6ToWFeUo_VrsKTwCUN5b2Hxqc"
1,fast chargin I used it in a S6 and a Nexus 5
1,great
-1,not good . keeps on falling down
-1,Seems as though it would protect.my phone well...however..touch sensitivity was greatly.deminished.....edge.features no longer worked easily.  Removed it after one week due to frustration
1,Fits perfectly on the phone. All the slots for various ports are perfectly aligned.
1,Product did not work out for me but I was contacted by customer service and offered to try another product of my choice which worked perfectly for my needs.  I ordered a second one for my gf not only because I like the product but their customer service is outstanding.
-1,This was very cheap. The wire broke within three days. Dont waste your money!
1,"Love it, good quality."
1,It still needs you to restart tablet before it will work
1,Great service. Good product.
1,Great band! Just what I wanted. Nice quality & design. Only downside is if you are a small female. I'm not extremely small but I do have tiny wrists. My band is set on the second to the smallest setting.
1,"Luv the Luvvitt.  Great protection, good color choices."
0,I like the concept BUT the back decal does not stay because the side edges keep lifting. I'm glad I order all colors because I had to throw two away. Adhesive needs to be stronger so there is no lifting. The first two I tried were ruined after one day of use.
-1,"Case makes screen shut off when using the voice to text function. I tried it with no case and there's no problem with voice to text and I tried it with my old case , also no problem. So I know it is the new case."
1,It oes just what I wanted it for!
1,Does it's job. Nothing special. I use it every day.
1,works great
1,Great case and works flawlessly with the olloclip lenses
0,It doesn't hold a charge for more than a couple days.
1,"The cover is chique, but lacks the dimple.  It fits like a glove and gives a very good grip.<br />The screenprotector is difficult to use combined with the case...the screenprotector should be a little bit smaller.  The edge of the cover 'picks' on the screenprotector making it come loose in at least one corner.<br />Never the less 5 stars because I bought a nice case and got the protector for free."
-1,"Poor customer service. Unit quit charging and the seller didn't flinch after I sent an email... Go buy a brand called &#34;tenergy&#34;. You will pay a bit more but the build quality, reliability and customer service is superior."
1,"So far this seems to be a very solid case.  It has been easy been east to get on and off, it is lite weight and not bulky at all."
1,"Does it's job well....I have owned it for about 2 weeks now. Has been charging my smartphone well. Charges from about 50% to full in about 2.15 hrs, which is pretty good. I connect my cell phone on the 1 amp port. It was shipped from China, had to clean off the dust, but other than that, no complaints!"
1,"I love this case, I'm watching for it to go sale again. My brother inlaw wants one."
1,Great sound out of a little container. Works good with the phone and my Kindle. It was great to take on vacation to the beach. It shocked me when it paired to my phone. Great buy....
0,cute
-1,This broke after 2 pictures. Huge disappointment.
0,"Just got it. Works so far.  But needed a 3.55mm extension cable so that I could position unit so that it could be seen<br />from front of tv for controlling, monitoring, and pairing.<br />I would have given it 4 stars  but I had to improvise to make it work for my particular application.<br />I needed it to connect to a jack on the back of my tv which is against a wall.<br />The transmitter has a switch and LEDS.  To make this visible I used an extension cable.<br />I would definitely  buy it again  and can recommend it."
1,"Performed as advertised ensuring the phone was protected when dropped, however only issue was with regards to dust buildup between the cover and the phone which needed to be cleaned out every so often as I work in extremely dusty environments."
1,Keeping my screen safe as I write i this review. Solid and smooth surface
1,This product was provided for a unbiased review.<br /><br />[note]<br />I was talking to the company for about a month trying to get the light adapter the sent me the wrong one a few times. But there lovely support time helped me and got me the peace I need.<br /><br />[packing]<br />This product came in a very well cushioned package and did not have any issues with it being damaged. But also I do feel they could have done a better job packing it but it's ok.<br /><br />[design]<br />This has a really nice look to it its one of the thinnest Wallet battery packs I could find. But sadly it will not fit in my wallet fits amazing in my pocket tho can't even feel it. The front has 4 blue LEDS that will like up to show you the battery percentage<br /><br />[battery]<br />This charger will hold 2000mah and it does amazing for a backup charger. I keep this In my back pocket if my iPhone suddenly dies on me. And it works amazingly<br /><br />[charging]<br />So this has a very unique way of charger. It uses to male ends and connects on them the to a USB to charger it's very different then other ones I have seen but it works! Also yes it's supposed to come with a 8-pin Lightning cable<br /><br />Overall this is a amazing charger and would recommend to any buddy who need a quick pocket battery!<br /><br />If you have any questions please feel free to a ask me in the comments<br /><br />Once again this Product was provided for a honest I'm unbiased review.<br /><br />-Hunter
0,Cute watch with many functions does not work well at all with iPhone and has no adequate software for it. So you can not use many fictions with apple products
-1,I bought this cover on Amazon after looking at all the reviews. Today my phone fell face down onto a concrete floor and the screen cracked. The point of impact was right on the side-edge of the case cover near the power button but the cover didn't absorb the impact. I don't recommend buying this cover.
1,Loving this case.  Super easy to put on or remove and has protected my phone from various drops of 3ft+
1,Best case ever!
1,First I noticed that the quality of the parts in the box was of excellent quality.<br /><br />All the parts fit nicely.  I tested everything and all worked as described.<br /><br />Highly recommended product would buy again
-1,Very ugly!!
0,My arm too small for this large iten.... though it fit my Galaxy Note 4 in its Otter Box.  So not the product problem.
0,Looks nice but breaks pretty easily.....
-1,This charger did not work for my Tom Tom Via1535 as stated on the website. When I asked to return the item I was told that I had to pay the shipping even though the product was misrepresented. Don't waste your money.
1,"Awesome case! Hardly notice it compared to my old one. I love my rugged i-Blason case as well, but this is a nice touch when I don't want the bulk."
1,Buy this if you want protection for your phone.
1,Good product
1,Very good amplifier!!!!!! My Vette now is rocking!!!! Very easy to install and very fast shipping!!!!
1,"After years of trying to buy a disc Stylus that worked alongside my difficulty handling a pen properly, (I did fail handwriting throughout elementary school), I've found these extremely helpful in helping me to be able to read my own digital handwriting."
1,Took a little while to get used to the new clasp coming from an up24 but overall I really like it. Tracking has improved.
1,This bluetooth headset is working good. i am able to get a perfect fit for maximum sound quality. Bluetooth easily paired with my iPhone 5. Best
1,fits great
1,So far so good! Tested first in my house in a jar filled with water and day after sailing and in the beach.
1,"It is the thinnest I've ever seen,love it!"
1,"Fabulously simple contraption. Goes on the wheel easy. Pops off really easy. Placing the phone in it & taking out also really easy. Can do it with one hand. One important consideration: if my speedometer was in the center & not off to the side, I would not be able to see it. All in all, really like it for when I'm using navigation or when I need to talk while driving. I ordered one for almost everyone I know."
1,"Overall great selfie stick.  I had to order another phone mount  because my Galaxy Note 4 with Otterbox would not fit.  But,  the stick itself is sturdy.  Would be a little scared to even put smaller phone in mount because the spring is not the strongest.  I ordered a XL RetiCAM for stick  mount.  With that combo,  you will have top-notch unit."
1,"this case is awesome! barely adds any size, but gives great protection. I'd highly recommend it. I've tried 3 other cases and this is easily the best."
1,Fosmon MATT Series Rubberized Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 met my expectations.
1,Really satisfied with this item!!  8 yr old grandson dropped iPod in toilet. Was saved by this case!!
1,thanks
1,"Decent grip once you figure out its supposed to clip in with the phone sideways, so the clip is open as wide as the phone."
1,"Love it. I have the previous version as well. The smaller footprint, and light were great improvements."
1,"Works as advertised. Charger can be used to recharge both batteries included, as well as the OEM battery that was originally in the Samsung Galaxy S5."
1,Exactly what I expected
1,Good
1,Great Case bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it. Took a bit to ship but it was well worth it for the price!
1,"Great ear buds. Easy to work, great sound. Use mine while working out, no problems. Worth the long wait to get them shipped"
1,Great product!
1,My original review was that these batteries were junk....however because of my 1 star rating the folks from Anker contacted me and sent me a whole new kit  including 2 new batteries and a charger... They sent several emails and even called me to make sure that I was happy with the order....  they get a 5 star for customer service...however after testing the battery for a month now the only thing is ...it does not quite last as long as the OEM Samsung....
1,as expected
1,It was what I was looking for and exactly as expected. Can't ask for much more.
1,TPU or die
-1,"Cheap plastics - feels cheap. Scratches easily. Glad this was cheap, it landed in the trash and not on my iPhone. My old Griffin case, is way better - even after 2 years of heavy use."
1,My package  was lost but he responded and called until we both figured it out. I will continue to purchase from him. Recommend to anybody.
-1,Stopped scanning for WiFi and WiFi just sometimes work and sometimes doesn't.
1,Very nice i iwll buy it again.
0,all of them stopped working after a few days of use
1,I received this product free in exchange for a honest review. The case comes in a little plastic baggy. The case doesn't make your phone thicker or heavier at all! This case is super light you can barely even tell it's on there. Everything fits perfect and snug. The buttons function properly and this plastic case is not made cheaply it really is durable! Fits my iphone 6 spot on! Would definitely recommend!
-1,I was able to reuse this about 4 times before it stopped holding a charge.
1,"Is what it is. Does what it is supposed to do. Like it says, doesn't include hardware but I didn't need it in this case."
1,Work great
-1,"I must have gotten a bad one, it doesn't do a very effective job of charging my iPhone 6 plus.  Charge for it about 30 in the charge and the battery only increased for 10%. The two USB port worked better from Acepower worked better."
1,Great case for a great price. Better than expected.
1,"We've been using the Jackery Giant+ for almost 12 months now and we love it. We've used it everyday to charge phones, tablets, run our GoPro cameras at night for extended time lapse settings and so many more uses.  We recently reviewed the new Titan model which boasts an 18,000 mAh battery capacity while providing 2.4A of solid power to two devices at the same time thanks to the dual USB ports.  Charging the Titan only takes 11 hours for a full charge while offering 390 hours of continuous use.  The portable battery weighs in at almost 1lb. and you can note it's premium quality and build upon picking the unit up for the first time.  Jackery is the #1 premium brand on Amazon and they've earned my business. Any future portable charging needs and I'll be selecting Jackery again in the future. Full review here: http://youtu.be/5whV-ky4dPo"
0,"I love the material this case is made from. Looks and feels great. The magnetic feature is AWESOME!  However, if you put in all four cards that the slots allot you the case does not close. I find this very disappointing."
0,"It was not the one to fit the cell phone that i requested. It was also a gift, and it was so loosely fit that the person dropped the phone a couple of times because it wasn't properly secured due to case was wrong side. The last time the phone fell off the case, it broke, and didn't work anymore. I was do embarrassed because it was also a gift to my sister's phone."
1,"Love it! But to be honest, I thought it was counterfit at first because of the package. How wrong was I, I'm writing my review on it."
1,the product is just awesome!
0,"Much larger than I expected. I guess I didn't look at the photo too closely or read the specs, because this is a pretty sizable USB charging unit. I bought it to replace an older Motorola dual charging block I lost, and was bummed that this was so big. (The Motorola one was the same size roughly of the OEM apple charger one gets with one's iPhone or iPod.) This does a good job of charging my iPhone and Acer tablet at the same time though, and tucked behind the bed, it's not really that much of a problem, but will keep looking for the same size dual USB charger that I had before."
-1,"Shipped vacuum sealed without desiccant.  6 of the 12 colors had multiple breaks in them.  They did not ship all the colors shown in the photo.<br />I have only used the filament to add a touch of color here and there in my e3d hotend, and it prints just fine.<br /><br />See attached picture to see what colors did come in.  I even arranged them in the same orientation and put the extra colors off to the side."
1,Love it!
-1,This band is ok. Decent quality. Received it in black as a gift. My GF bought it when they were priced under $10. Has had price hikes 2-3 times since. Not bad for the price but it's getting more expensive which lessens that &#34;pro&#34;.
1,Love this case :-)
1,Great protection for iPhone 6+. Everyone loves seeing me talk on the phone!
-1,The top piece keeps coming off.  I would not recommend.
1,"I love this handy phone. I plug it into my sell phone in my office when I'm working. I heard you can get radiation from cell phones being close to you head. So I use this one to stop that. Plus it works great for using it on your computer for talking on the phone through the internet instead of through the computer {it's mac and pc compatible and works on any cell phone. Hope this helps you make a choice. And YES there is no volume control on it, I guess because most cell phones have volume controls and computers do also maybe thats why. You can adjust it through them."
1,Works great
1,Great product charges rapidly
-1,"Extremely buggy, the app is horrible and is an eyesore. It'll also randomly shut off power to the device at will.  I don't use it at all anymore. I wish I could get a refund."
1,Nice phone for a reasonable price.
1,There was a crack when i got it but it doesnt matter i still love the case.
1,Revised Review:  Had a problem with one of the two working.  However Anker contacted me directly and voluntarily shipped out a replacement without any question.  So higher rating for excellent customer service response.  These do fit nicely inside the holder with Anker charger/converter.  (Earlier review: Shipped two - one worked.  One did not.)
1,Does exactly what you expect / need it to do.
1,Berry good
1,Great quality cables very sturdy wish they were a bit longer but they are excellent for the price.
0,"The cabling between the earpiece and the necklace are really flimsy. It didn't come with small size earpiece cover. But not as expensive as the original design (LG, I think)."
0,Dropped phone with this case on it and it did not protect the phone ...phone broke and never worked again
1,"It fits well and does what it's supposed to do. When I take the case off, the phone looks as new as the day I bought it. I would give it five stars if the clear case hadn't yellowed. Also, when debris does eventually work its way in between the case and the back of the phone, it wears permanent smudges into the inside of the case."
1,great sound. loved it
1,Great phone!
1,"This looks and feels nice. It was worth the money. The only downside is that it only has 2 places for cards, technically only one slot for cards and one for an ID. It works for now but if you ha e more 4 cards you need to carry this isn't for you."
0,This case does protect your phone but the pink stopped looking pink and started looking dirty really quick. For the price I would have liked the color to stay.
1,"Waaaaaay better than the standard Project Fi case that comes in the Welcome Kit. It's easy to put on the phone, and can take a beating. If and when my current case dies, I'll likely get this one again."
-1,Was not a fan of his extremely slow it was couldn't get any thing don't with it
-1,"The first one I received did not work. I'm running Android 5.1 and made sure all the settings were correct so that a picture was taken when the volume up key was pressed(the issue was not the phone or settings). I told the seller I had received a defective one and they said they would send out a replacement. After a big hassle with the seller the replacement finally did arrive and it also does not work. Don't waste your time on this, it's not worth the headache."
1,Came on time and my last one saved my phone so hoping this one does too :)
0,"It is nice and slim, but I don't feel that it is good protection in case I drop my IPad.  I may buy a new one that is padded better."
0,works for a month then stops
0,I purchased two Samsung OEM 2.0 Amp Micro Home Chargers to have extra chargers for travel. One of the chargers worked fine but the one that I took to visit my daughter for three weeks did not work and would not charge my phone. I needed to borrow a charger for the rest of my trip. I will have to figure out how to return the non-working charger.
1,Smooth and slim but still protects well. Great purchase for the cost.
1,It protects well.  No scratches evident since I got them placed on my phone
1,"Although the color of the tassel doesn't appear as dark/vibrant as the pictures, they look great! The case is thin so it doesn't further expand the size of my already-big-enough iphone 6. Worth buying! :)"
-1,Worked fine for a month
1,"Works well, nice size and price."
1,"Selfie stick is built very strong, constructed like I would build it. Highly recommend the item as a great buy, it is truly what a professional would have nearby. Remote shutter control over Bluetooth performs flawlessly, easy to set up on my Samsung android cell phone. I would have no reservations recommending it to a friend. Engineering and materials could not have been mated any better. My hat is off to Fugetek, you knocked it out of the park with this item."
1,Love it.  Only thing I could do with out is the bright blue LED light that flashes when my phone is on the unit.
-1,Not much protection there are so many more cases with more protection and cost much less. I prefer built in screen protectors and this one doesn't have one.
-1,"nice look but 2 days after getting the case, it had dropped on the ground and broke. if you are a clumsy person i do not recommend getting this case it is not durably made at all"
1,Best iPhone case ever!!!
-1,You can not hear nothing with this cover.
1,I have these and the 4.0 version and I have to say I like these so much more.  I like the stiff band around the neck much better than the lose one (the lose one used to get stuck when I turned my head).  These are very comfortable and I hardly feel them at all while running.  They are easy to pair and easy to turn on/off.  The battery lasts a long time (but I haven't clocked it).  I have used them for phone calls as well and the sound is great as is noise cancellation.  The only complaint I might have about this is the location of the multi-function button is right over top of the volume button.  When you grab to adjust volume your tendency is to squeeze so I have accidentally dropped calls trying to adjust volume.  This is just a learning issue for me though and will be fine once I adjust.<br />These headphones are a great buy!
1,"Best glass screen protector I've bought for any phone. It does not scratch, visibility is great,  and the glass was very easy to install."
0,Average case at most! Not much protection just looks nice.
1,I love these tempered glass protectors. This is the third purchase i made on this same iCarez protector brand. It has kept my iPhone's screen beautifully protected since a few years now. Very good quality product. I  really love how my phone hardly gets any fingerprints for regular use; i would need to have very filthy or greasy hands in order to smudge the screen. Totally worth it!
0,In General a good case but my cards dont fully fit bc the pockets are too small
1,The case was exactly as described. It fits perfectly and the screen protector is as good as any other. This was definitely a good buy!
-1,"This is the second screen protector I am buying for OnePlus One. The first one was from OnePlus itself. This one does not have a cutout for the camera which means that it might distort the image slightly, but at least it protects the camera too. Also this is much smoother both in the edges and the cutout. Finally I really enjoy the oleophobic coating, since it makes it easier to type on and keeps fingerprints away. For now I will only give 4 starts, since I only have it for a few days. If it lasts more than two months without any damage it will get 5 starts!    UPDATE: This screen protector proved to be way worse than it seemed... I dropped my phone the other day and even though the protector barely got damaged, my screen was completely shattered..."
1,"I bought a pair of these back in March and only now (late-August) have had a chance to use one of them (the other is a spare). It turns out for my use-case this gadget is pretty-much spot-on.<br /><br />The Steambot Slider works exactly as intended in a Smart ForTwo Pure with the base head-unit which has both a USB and a 3.5mm audio jack for auxiliary device input. The Steambot plugs into the USB (for power only) and the included audio cable connects the output of the Steambot to the 3.5mm audio input. After starting the car I can hear start-up tones from the Streambot from the sound system. It takes me a few moments to start the audio source on my iPhone (I might use the iTunes Music app, the SiriusXM app, or the app for my local NPR station) but once I've started the app, the sound plays through as expected.<br /><br />The only &#34;negative&#34; I have experienced is the 20 second time-out of the Steambot. If I take too long to get the audio app running on my iPhone the Steambot times out and turns off. To turn it back on I have to open the glove box and then unplug/plug the Steambot. This is a slight inconvenience. If the USB and audio port were on the dashboard this wouldn't be much of a inconvenience but in the ForTwo the inputs are in the glovebox so it is what it is."
1,"The original one that I received has great day time image with wide 170 angle ( exactly what we need for rear-view ). Night vision has horizontal lines covering the screen, looks like I received a defective one.  I understand it could happen for any product due to any reason, the most important point is how the company able to handle the issue for satisfying the customers.  Hisgadget Amy was so quick to respond to my concern by sending me a replacement with no extra charge, the new one performs great, out of my expectation.  Great price, great product quality, especially excellent after-sale service. Highly recommended, very happy."
0,Didn't hold up well at all. There are several of these that look a lot alike. This is the cheapest one and it broke really quick.
1,Thus phone is unbelievable
1,It's my favorite case right now it's slim it's nice and it keeps my iPhone protected at all time.
-1,"Returned.  It doesn't pair well.  It pairs.  However, I took it once and try to pair with my friend's phone.  It won't pair.  We ended up not taking the selfie.  :("
1,A bit difficult to put on smoothly but very nice
1,Bought this cause lost my older jawbone era. Love the case it comes with acts as some extra charge. This unit doesn't hold charge as long as my older one. Fits well sounds great. Love the color.
-1,"It's cute at first but the picture gets scratched/worn off too quickly in my opinion. Also, it picks up a blue tint from jeans. Worst of all the case is not even secure on the phone! I dropped my phone once and the case just burst open and the phone flew out and got scratched!!! I buy cases specifically so they can take the brunt of a fall and protect my phone (and its value) and this basically doesn't do anything that it's supposed to!"
-1,"Stopped working after a month. Go with Anker, this product is garbage."
1,"This case is really cute and fits the 6+ perfectly. It's great to have something so cute to hold it and my cards and cash all in one! Girl pockets are hardly ever big enough for a tube of chapstick much less a ginormous phone like these are so it's very useful. It is simple and pretty and the stain resistant material will help it stay looking nice. Mine is cream colored with a nice brown magnetized close flap.There is a small gold bird emblem on the lower right hand corner and the words &#34;Always Together&#34; are written on the close flap. This wallet case has  four slots for your credit cards and a larger pocket for cash and then the holder for the phone. This holder is soft gummy material and is easy to take The phone in and out of. I actually broke my last wallet case taking my phone out. First it had peeled the holder away from the case and then one edge snapped completely off. Since this one is soft it holds it securely but isn't hard to take in and out. You can take pictures through the case as there is a cutout for the camera. There are also cutouts below the phone for the mic and ports so you can charge or talk while in the case. The front easily bends back for comfort while you're talking on the phone.I am very pleased with this case, it is stitched well and should stay looking nice for a long time. It's definitely worth the asking price, if not more, for this quality.<br />I actually received my wallet case free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinions of this case."
-1,i purchased this unit through another site it did not do well at all i hooked it up to 3-160 watt solar panels for a total of 480 watts theyre wired in parallel at first it put out about 150 watts in full sun i got that reading using my killawatt meter about 2 minutes later it tripped my GFI plug but continued to show wattage on the killawatt meter meaning it was still running so the anti island feature was not working i had already pulled the plug so it should have turned off but it did not finally a few seconds later it went up in smoke it was throwing lots of smoke out of the vents. i do have another brand of inverter that ive been running for several months without issues so I'm just not sure on the quality of this brand.
1,"I got these for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter - they fit a little big, but she can still use them without any problems. They are plenty loud enough for her, without getting too loud. Easy to use with the IPad so she can watch her shows."
1,Great☺
1,"Yeah, I really love this phone. Works flawlessly (so far). Not missing anything important when compared to the S6"
-1,Not as expected...slow delivery.
1,This case cannot be beat for the price. I bought it specially because it was so damn cheap. Even if I never use it.
-1,"Its a nice screen protector, but the glue used is sub par. it has already began to raise on the edge of the phone."
-1,"I think it is B.S to charge over $6 dollars to send this back, when I paid a little over $9."
1,Great little case.
1,As expected
1,Really sturdy case!
1,Very good product supported by excellent service
1,I have these in my 2008 F-150 and they sound really good.  I wish I had put an amp on them because I'm sure they would rock even harder.  I am very pleased with the performance and would buy this again.
1,Easy to charge watch and looks nice too
1,llegaron tarde
1,Great product no problems at all and much better price for 2 than 1 at verizon.
1,Works great as intended.
1,"I'm surprised of how easy it was to install it to my phone. No air bubbles at all, I would recommend watching the video first before you install it. I am very pleased of how it looks on my phone as well"
0,Suction cup worked for a while but eventually wouldn't stick to the windshield anymore. I believe this was cause by the heat of summer degrading the plastic.
1,It's fast and Apple certified!
0,"Definitely a cheaper arm band, and my boyfriend who has modest arms has trouble getting this to fit comfortably."
-1,"fake product, i received broken item,<br />please don't buy it under any cost"
1,Received these today and my 8 yr old autistic son loves them
1,Its a really pretty case! The picture does not do it justice.
1,The cord works. Delivered on time.
-1,Cheap crap
1,one of the grands wanted this.  they like it.
1,It's really nice having 2 ports to plug into - and it works great with my Samsung Note 4 phone.
-1,"Had the case for about a month before it started falling apart. The sides rip away from the back with casual use, horrible quality and would absolutely not recommend."
1,"I bought this for my new phone, and love it.  It's very pretty, and looks just like the picture."
0,"Its great..... But..... The sweat depreciates the quality of the product. Also, it begins to tear slowly after so much use. Its basically a cheap sweatband with a plastic sown in design. Well, the plastic is peeling off the hard plastic encasing. Soooooo...... Do NOT spend alotta money on this. Its a great product, but wont last you 6 months. Buy it as cheap as you can get it. Its up to you !"
0,"Really hard to put on, but so far it's protected my phone."
0,Very disappointed with the fit of the ear-piece. Hurts the inside of my ear.
1,Attach perfectly to the phone and seems durable
1,"Nice, just as described."
1,"Nice fit, good protection and just love it!"
1,Great item fast shipping
1,"I have been looking for a car mount for a while now and finally found one that works great! A friend recommended eLander mount and I have been very satisfied with it so far. I like the 360 degree adjustable back and that the joystick is flexible and allow me to adjust what angle I want my screen at. The best part is there is no assembly required, you just pop it on the vents and go. The only issue I do have is that it will fall if I do not secure the back in the vent enough, otherwise I have zero complaints. I highly recommend this product!"
1,Works great and was easy to install
1,It protects the back and sides well.  It is a simple design that functions well.  Nice case that does not add a lot of bulk.  It also makes the phone easy to hold on to.
0,"perfect for what I need, protects my phone -attractive, and holds cards."
1,"I have used I don't know how many car chargers (my first one was for a Palm!),  so it isn't that easy for me to be pleasantly surprised (*unpleasantly* surprised, yes, but not pleasantly).  Hi-Mobiler managed it, with this charger they sent me for evaluation and review.<br /><br />First, it's a &#34;smart&#34; charger, meaning that when you plug a device into it, it somehow 'reads' it to learn what the highest amperage it can handle is, then feeds it just that much power.  I have an iPhone 6 and an Android tablet (and a Kindle, and...), and on multiple-port chargers I can never remember which end of the charger has the 1.0mAh port and which end is the 2.0mAh... and they're labeled in print too fine to be read without pulling the thing out of the cigarette lighter (oops-- &#34;power port&#34;) and holding it up under the light.  It's a pain in the backside unalleviated by heated car seats.<br /><br />The ports on the Hi-Mobiler are each labelled 2.4, which is higher than even Apple products require.  With this charger, though, the labels are just decorative-- plug your device into any of the ports and the Smart Charger will simply charge it, at whatever amperage for which the device is rated.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />[I was offered this charger at no cost in exchange for a fair and honest review.]"
1,Great responses form our guys in the construction field
-1,I would not recommend ArmorSuit. It does not stick to the crystal on the watch. Look for a different solution otherwise you will waste your money!!
0,"it comes in handy, the quality is ok"
1,waterproof
1,Best charger out there. Nice size and great value!
1,"Just what we needed, just as described."
1,"This device solved a real problem for me; the proliferation of adapters for tablets and phones.  I just run the various cables from this box to my devices and it makes everything very simple.  Charging isn't a process to manage, but simply a chore that is easily accomplished.  Great idea."
1,Everything went well and product arrived in a timely manner.
0,"Fast, cheap and worth every penny. It's light and thin as well with decent battery life.<br /><br />I give it three stars because:<br />1) A recent update caused Wifi connectivity issues. I have to turn my phone off and on multiple times a day because wifi will stop detecting all networks.<br />2) The 3.5mm audio jack (headphones/aux) is very quiet. I'd say it would need to be boosted by at least 30% in order to match other phones. This is regardless of which music app, which pair of headphones and which device I'm plugging it in through an aux cable with. I keep my old Lumia 521 in my car for music.<br />3) Touchscreen goes extremely crazy when sending text messages - for every button I press 4-8 more are pressed. This happens on an off and I have to restart the phone to stop it. This doesn't happen in any other app such as facebook messenger."
-1,another chinese junk.. does not hold charges.. i can not even charge my phone full  for 1 single time... drain out too quick.
1,"i really enjoy the case, only problem i had was the stand piece comes off easily, within 2weeks of having it came off but otherwise the cover is good to have it."
1,Great item and it came by pretty fast
0,I had it for a week and the corner tab on the top left the holds the phone in broke off. I would say spend a little more and get something of better quality.
1,Love 'em.
1,Very sturdy and duable. Satisfied with this product.
-1,"this phone is no good ,memory card is all screwed up an other things on it"
1,"This ReGear iCharger is a 30 pin charger for the car. It works fine to recharge my daughter's iPhone 4S. She is happy, so I am happy. We've not had any issues with this charger. Since it is for the car only, it's getting only light use. I received this at a discount in exchange for a fair review, which I have provided."
-1,water got into the case.
1,"I got mine in the mail, and I've been using it daily. It's fits perfectly on the A/C vent closest to the steering wheel of my tahoe. Great affordable product for quality you can count on. You won't be disappointed."
1,Front stage center stereo excellent...
-1,"will not work on my ipad air. Did not know Apple put a chip in so you would have to buy their product, am very disappointed cause I need a longer cable. I wish you had added iphone etc on page when I ordered."
1,Thank you!
1,"I ordered this when I could not find my old one.  Considered returning it when I found the old one; however, I like this one better.  It &#34;talks&#34; to you, and it has features my other one does not.  Makes calling easier."
1,"As described, good chargers"
-1,"DON'T BUY THIS!! It is very cheap for a reason. It only lasted about a week before part of it broke off on the side, and now a week later a lot more on the side has broken off. It's very thin. Cheap made. Sometimes you do get what you pay for..."
1,"Ever since the very first Android “smart phone” many years ago, I’ve owned more phones (and tablets) than I can recall. Looking at a few recent phones, I’ve owned Galaxy Note 3 & 4, Galaxy S 4 & 5, LG G2/G3/G4, Nokia 1520, Xperia Z Ultra (6.45”), and my current daily driver, the Google Nexus 6 (5.96”). Needless to say, I’m familiar with many models, big & small. :) So let’s take that experience and see how the latest low budget phone from Blu fares.  PROS:  + Excellent value as a phone and/or tablet + Nice looking 7” IPS Display + Very bright screen + Nearly stock Android Lollipop 5.0 + Great Battery Life + Smooth UI Performance + Expandable Storage + Decent build quality + Comfortable to hold, despite it’s size + Looks more expensive than it is + Factory Unlocked for GSM  CONS:  - Low resolution cameras & no flash - Mediocre sounding single speaker & voice quality - Display only 600x1024 (169 ppi) - Limited band support (i.e. no LTE) - Some light bleed - Loose Power/Volume Buttons - No accessories at launch  SPECS:  Since this listing excludes a few important details, I’ll note them here:  * 7” IPS+ 600x1024 (169 ppi) Display * 1.3GHz MediaTek MT8382 Quad-Core CPU w/ MALI 400 GPU * 8GB Internal memory / 1GB RAM / MicroSD storage expandable up to 64GB * 5MP Front & VGA Rear Camera (No Flash) * HSPA + 21Mbps / 3G (aka 4G) Band Support Only- No LTE anywhere * 3450mAh Non-Removable Battery * Full-Size SIM Required for GSM Voice/Data (i.e. T-Mobile/AT&T) * NOT compatible with CDMA Carriers (i.e. Sprint/Verizon) * Includes Headphones, Screen Protector, 2 Amp Charger, and 3ft Cable  DESIGN  For the first time, I’m almost comfortable using the word “phablet” to describe this device. It’s got the screen of a traditional tablet, yet has full voice/data functionality in a slimmed down package. I’m going to just call it a big phone.  First, let’s briefly talk about it’s size. This is a big phone, easily dwarfing my 6” Nexus 6. But it’salso a really small tablet. Compared to a Nexus 7, it’s noticeably smaller in every dimension. While you won’t be doing a lot of one-handed use, it’s still compact enough to fit in the pockets of my less-tight fitting pants. That's as far I'll on about size; it is what it is!  The phone has a mostly plastic construction, with bezels that look like they are higher quality than they are. The back has a nice rubberized texture that makes for a nice place to hold. You’ve got a front ear piece that doubles as the single mono speaker. Interestingly, the headphone and mico-USB port are on the top.  Power and volume rocker switch are on the right side, towards the top. They feel a bit loose and have some play to them. And the micro-SD and Full-Size SIM card slot are covered by a door that requires a tiny flat-head screwdriver to remove. Tool included. And yes, I did say good ‘ol Full Size SIM card. You can buy adapters.  While the textures and coloring won’t fool you into thinking this phone is made of high quality metals, it still looks nice. And the phone has a good solid feel. If you give it a firm twist, there is some expected flex. But no noises… yet.  PERFORMANCE  As you can see from the specs, this phone has a MediaTek SoC with Mali 400 GPU. This CPU is based on the ARM A7 architecture, most commonly associated with the Snapdragon 400, and used with some Octa Core variants. So yes, this is rather dated technology, except do note this is a Quad Core CPU. Not dual core as the original A7’s. It also has the benefit of running cool and being thrifty with power usage. We’ll discuss more on battery life later.  That’s all great, but how does it perform? Thanks to a nearly stock Lollipop 5.0 OS, it runs pretty darn good. Within the UI, things are smooth, fluid, and little-to-no lag/stutter is noticeable there. However, when you start opening/switching apps, the slower CPU & limited memory will make itself known. That’s simply unavoidable with these specs. With that said, it’s still relatively minor, and overall, runs better than expected.  BENCHMARKS & GAMING  While I prefer to focus on real-world performance and don’t usually put much weight behind synthetic benchmarks, here are a few anyways:  3DMark Ice Storm Extreme: 1922 AnTuTu Benchmark v5.7.1: 19590 Geekbench 3 - Single Core: 363 / Multi-Core: 1196  Not the best numbers, but how do games run? So far, they’ve all run just fine. Most games will lower details and resolution to keep them running smooth. As a result, you may see some grainy video or more pixels than you’re used to for high-end titles. Also, because this is a “less common” MediaTek processor, you could run into issues where a game isn’t compatible (i.e. SimCity BuildIt).  Temple Run, for example, ran great. Noticed some grainy images at the title screen, but that’s it. Asphalt 8 also ran smooth & was easy to control, but it’s much more obvious the details have been pushed way down.  OS & FEATURES  As noted above, we are looking at a nearly stock Android 5.0 Lollipop OS. It’s currently still only 5.0, it says it’s upgradable, but no word on when that will actually happen. Of course, just being 5.0 is good enough for now. In particular as there is very little bloatware installed.  You’ve got some Amazon stuff you’ll need to hide, they’ve got Opera, an FM Radio, Google Apps, BLU Help app, and not much else. The OS provides some audio profiles, reboot/airplane mode when pressing the power button, and you can even scheduled power on/off via the Settings menu.  They do include the TouchPal keyboard as default. This one is somewhat new to me, although I’m already finding it’s auto-correct to be surprisingly aggressive and incorrect many times. No worries though. It’s easy to disable.  DISPLAY  After using so many Quad HD IPS and OLED displays, it’s a bit noticeable when jumping down to a lower resolution display. In particular, this 7” IPS+ 600x1024 screen. However, it’s not as bad as it sounds. First, this is an IPS display. The colors are nice and vibrant. Black levels won’t blow you away, but they’re pretty good.  As with many LCD’s these day, the white balance is way on the cool side, which can appear as a light blue tint. Light bleed, while minor, is certainly noticeable. In particular when watching movies with a black background, in a darker room. Viewing angles are acceptable. Very little color shift; you’re mostly going to deal with notable dimming as you view off center.  Brightness is way up there. Indoors I rarely needed to go past 30-40%. Which is actual brightness, since there is no pesky ambient light sensor that I need to turn off. Although I do wish it got dimmer. In a completely dark room, sometimes I found it to be a little brighter than I’d like even at the lowest setting.  Back to the low resolution. How does it really look? In daily use, it actually looks just fine. The only situation it’s really an issue is when you try to look at a full desktop website in portrait mode. It’s here where tiny text and some images can look a blurry. You can of course zoom in, switch to landscape, or stick with mobile versions of websites.  Otherwise reading documents, flipboard, & e-books all look great and are quite pleasant to read on a larger screen.  CAMERA  We’ll keep this one short. It’s a 5MP rear camera and VGA (640x480) on the front. There is no flash. Basically, quality isn’t great for either one of these. Even with good lighting, the images will appear soft, grainy, and noticeably low detail. Clearly this was one area that took the biggest hit to keep the cost so low.  BATTERY  For a large 7” phone, a 3450mAh battery sounds like it would be on the small side. And if this had a ton of pixels and super fast SoC to push, it would be. But a low resolution screen combined with a very energy efficient CPU, and it’s really not that at all. So there’s your upside to low specs!   In my testing, I was able to achieve 7 hours 22 minutes of Screen-On Time, with about 12% battery life remaining. That was with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS all enabled. Screen at about 40%, which could have gone lower for indoor use, but I decided to keep it bright.  There was lots of web surfing, reading flipboard, and well over an hour of video playback with both YouTube and MXPlayer, each. Charging was also quick, getting up to nearly half capacity within about an hour or so.  Once again, your results will absolutely vary.  SOUND & VOICE  Interestingly, this phone shares the ear-piece for main speaker use. That speaker grill you see on the front/top of the phone is the only speaker on this device. Yes, it’s the same one used for voice calls. The mic is way at the bottom.  The speaker sadly doesn’t get very loud, sounds tiny at higher volumes, and doesn’t have much detail. It’s simply adequate. Given it’s movie watching aspirations, I really do wish it had another speaker at the bottom for stereo.  The microphone also isn’t the best quality. Test calls resulted in the same mediocre ear-piece sound quality and on the other end, my voice was slightly distorted or muffled at times. Even if I got closer to the microphone, it didn’t change all that much. Although both parties were still able to hear each other and carry on a conversation.  MISSING HARDWARE & BAND SUPPORT  You’re already expecting a few things to get cut when trying to hit a low price point on a big phone. So what are some notable items I haven’t already discussed? First, there is only 802.11n 2.4GHz support for WiFi. No 5Ghz or AC support. It’s still plenty fast, hitting over 40mbps on my router; it won’t break any records.  No NFC. But we do still have GPS & Bluetooth of course. No notification light. No camera flash. With only 8GB of internal storage & 1GB of RAM, you could run into some limitations. Although for memory, that usually just means apps won't stay cached in memory as long, and may take longer to open than usual. And with low storage you'll want to keep as much on the MicroSD card as you can. You've already lost around 2.5GB in system data alone. Most apps are getting updated to support SD card installation. Plus, there is an option in Settings to change the &#34;default&#34; storage location. Once again, up to the app to cooperate.  And as noted in specs, there are only a few GSM bands for HSPA+ 21 / 3G. Also commonly referred to as 4G by some carriers. That’s also the slower HSPA+ connection. Which on AT&T in the Austin, TX area, meant around 4Mbps down & a little over 1Mpbs up. Your results will vary. It’s not blazing, but it will do for most internet tasks.  To clarify, there is no LTE support on either the Global or US (my phone) variant. And will only work with a GSM carrier, such as AT&T or T-Mobile.  CONCLUSION  The Blu Studio 7.0 II fits into what may seem like an odd category for many folks, in certain regions. But for others, it makes perfect sense to combine your tablet & phone needs into one cost effective gadget. If you’re able to comfortably carry around such a large phone and don’t have a need for high-end (or mid-range) specs, I think you’ll be very satisfied with this one.  Bottom line, it has most of the important features needed to keep it useful and they didn’t get too carried away on the budget cutting board. Although with that said, I’d love to see what Blu could do in a higher-end category. If they even simply upgraded to a 1080p display, faster SoC, decent stereo speakers, and keep a fair price, it would be impressive.  In either case, all things considered, this one is definitely recommended."
1,great
1,Great fit and looks good. The only thing is I wish the plate covered the entire back.
-1,"Couldn't believe how cheap this was. Too good to be true? Yes! Warned me it might take 4-5 weeks to arrive from China, actually arrived in 2 weeks! Now the bad news: BATTERY IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS! Doesn't work. The battery light on my phone is red when the battery is almost dead, yellow when it is very weak and green when it is charged or charging. My phone's battery light now shows an exclamation mark (!). Battery does not hold a charge, does not even begin to charge. I took a chance...I got burned!"
1,Very pleased with my Benuo leather case for my iPhone6. Love the feel and look.
1,Ordered this for my wife's phone.  She is very satisfied with the design and the way it fits.  It came quickly in a padded envelope
1,"Provides good charge times but the way the prongs are positioned means it can take up an extra socket if you're using it on a surge protector like I am. Other than that, it's OEM-like in quality for a fraction of the cost."
0,does the job. It's a little bulky
1,Great
-1,"had to return them, their range in a city or any place with any sort of obstacle is about a mile!"
1,Very nice protective screen.  Easy to apply and left no bubbles.
1,I love the color and it protects my phone from accidental dials.
0,Doesn't provide much protection.
1,Fits great
1,surprisingly a pretty good case
1,Solid quality. Feels a lot more expensive than the $10 it costs. Completely charges a iPhone 6 Plus or a Galaxy Note 5 without dying.
-1,"The case itself does not fit the phone, thus disabling the use of the silent switch on the top left edge of the phone. The finishing around the edges of the aluminum face is of poor quality and the case itself looked used. On the packaging it states that it comes with a leather lanyard and that it is made in the U.S.A., but the lanyard was neither leather nor was the product made in the U.S.A. After further research the product was produced in the China. Overall, poor quality and false advisement."
1,"So far no Complaints at all  I have purchased numerous different cables from other vendors for charging a house full if I- somethings, and you never know what you are going to get..  Trusted cables reached out to me asap and wanted to make sure my order was exactly what I expected, and with this Lifetime warranty that is offered, this is a NO- Brainer...  Quality Products with an even better Warranty attached to it..  I have found my exclusive source for Charging cables going forward..  would be 6 stars if that was possible.!!!!"
-1,"This case was very pretty and very functional.  It seemed to be very well made.  However the first night I got it,  I had to take my phone out of the case to charge it.  I was very disappointed in that.  I tried all three chargers and it would not charged in the case.  Had I been able to charge my phone while it was in the case I would of kept it.  Unfortunately I could not so I had to send it back."
1,"Pretty case, looks just like the picture"
-1,"It is not for iphone 5, it has an adapter and that's not what they're selling with that picture."
1,"My product started to peel off in the corners, but I emailed the company and called. They were super nice and replaced my back cover no questions asked!! Highly satisfied with my order!!"
1,works perfect
1,"Just as described, no defects whatsoever! Will buy from you again!"
-1,Worst chip!
1,"I do like this case a lot! After reading reviews and seeing that it splits apart, I am just waiting for that day. In the meantime, I love this case a lot, it is not too slim and can still grip it great. I hate the fact these phones are so fragile and have to hide it, but this case still protects it and can still see the design of this expensive phone!"
1,I got the clear one. Love it. It so thin but good enough for light protection. I normally do not like using the case but this one is really good. It's make me more comfortable to hold and also show the beautiful look. I'd recommended it.
1,"I bought these as a  backup for my LG Tone set.  They actually sound pretty good and are pretty comfortable.  They pair and connect quickly.  However, sometimes I like to leave one ear out so that I can hear what's going on around me (when on a call or listening to podcasts), and they will pull on your ear.  This is one of the downsides of these types of bluetooth headsets with just a cable connecting the two earpieces."
1,"Not sure what I would have done while motorcycling, in Europe, without it.  I can take the micro SD card out of my camera or GoPro, edit the video/pictures and put the cards back in the camera/tablet/gopro or phone.  Great idea/"
1,Works great
-1,it broke within a week of purchasing.  Total garbage!
1,"Works really well but the instructions aren't clear at all, it's sorta self explanatory though."
1,I love my Tempe for camping trips. Hook this up to your backpack or hang it outside / in the tent / wherever and you'll get much more accurate temperature logs than you do with a watch on your wrist. If your very interested in tracking temperature while out in the wild and still want to huddle down in your sleeping bag while you check the temperature outside this is worth it.
1,"I LIVE WAY OUT IN A METAL CLAD HOME. SINCE ADDING THE SIGNAL BOOSTER TO MY HOME AND ONE FOR MY CAR, I JUST DON'T DROP CALLS"
-1,"I bought two of these phones when they first came out (August 2015). So far, my screen has gone black and now my flash doesn't work and my husband's screen has also gone black and he cannot use his phone without an ear piece because his speaker no longer works. Our screens did come back on within 24 hours. I emailed BLU and never heard back. Maybe others have had better luck, but my experience has been less than stellar."
1,"Plugged right in, don't believe all the one star comments"
1,"Great sound, and easy to install.  The quality was top notch for the price.  I wish I would have stuck to my JL's sooner..."
0,So good
-1,Stopped working one month after purchase
1,My 7 year old loves them and can use them with no problems. No more Tangles here.
-1,Not real leather.
1,I really like this case. It fit my phone really well and looks really cute too. I've already dropped it a couple of times and it helped keep my phone from getting scratched or breaking. Defiantly worth the money i paid.
1,"Fantastic.  These have good range, come in variety of different colors, and come with a convenient key chain tag.  I use them with Tasker / Trigger app combination on my android device.  Love how efficient my device has become because of them!  Turns menial, sometimes-tedious, tasks into an even simpler tap of your device."
1,I bought this a few months ago and it still looks pretty good thank you muah!
-1,Didnt fit the droid razor
1,"Excellent Product and great quality, I use it for my ATV and it worked perfectly!"
-1,"No it was horrible, it wasn't the right color of what I expected."
1,The case was delivered on the date it was assigned and it came really early during the day which I liked. The case fits my iPhone 5s perfectly and I love this case.
1,As advertised
1,"Great case. Protects the phone well, even the corners. Has enough of a lip to really make a difference while still remaining thin and durable. Nice product."
1,Looks exactly as pictured and arrived on schedule
1,"Great case.  It fit's perfectly and is really sturdy.  Love the kick stand, it makes it convenient for watching."
1,Awesome product
-1,Crap. Waste of hard earned money!
1,Just as described
1,I have always loved these Incipio cases because I feel they give the most protection to the phone! This case seems to wear down very quickly and I end up buying a new one every other month because of how beat up they end up looking; But I would rather pay for a new case than a new phone
-1,"This cover is awful. The screen cover is gapped, and makes touch screen access awful. Stuff gets under the screen cover making a mess.... save your $  get a life proof."
1,"I initially bought this for a road trip this summer and it was amazing.  We do have an outlet to plug it into in our truck so I could charge both our phones, both our iPads and both of our motorcycle Scala Rider headsets all at the same time!!!  It was perfect.  Now I am using it at my desk.  It really streamlines all the devices I need to charge and makes it less messy and more organized.  Fantastic!! Thank you!!"
1,worked well
1,"Purchased for the GPS for vacation to the Northwest and used the GPS in Seattle, Mt. Rainier, Olympic National Park, Victoria BC, and Vancouver. We are very happy with this GPS. The directions are very accurate and the traffic alerts are very helpful. When there is traffic ahead, the traffic alert will notify about the traffic and potential alternate route. Got updated maps from Magellan and it took about 20 to 30 minutes to update the map.  Minor complaint is that the GPS unit connects to the satellite a little slow when the power is turned on. So you will have to wait a bit to get signal."
1,"JOTO's waterproof case does everything as described! It's a such relief not to have to worry about my iPhone 6+, just enjoy it! Used my JOTO on the water this weekend (I'm 73 & love kayaking). My JOTO is easy & simple to use (important when dexterity lessens!) and I got just as clear pictures as when it's not in the JOTO."
1,I bought this in order to arrange the cables in the office. Solid performance. Exterior finish was great. I want to buy one more for my family.
-1,scratches too easily . I'm on my second in two months and I'm not a over user.
-1,"Well, I started out loving this product.  It charged my phone in warp speed.  Awesome, right?!  Then, the 3rd day I had it, it was plugged in and my phone fell off the counter.  The plug part pulled as it fell since the cord wasn't quite long enough to reach the ground.  Well, the whole thing came apart!  I mean it plug into the phone just kind of disintegrated - it was the weirdest thing ever!  I had to use plyers to get out the last piece of the plug that got stuck in my phone when it came apart.  Very disappointed."
1,Shipping time was fast...phone was just what i was looking for.
-1,I could not get it to charge in my car
0,"I got this phone to replace my Rugby Smart that survived 4 years of rugged use and neglect until the charging port wore out.  I loved that phone!  The Rugby Pro is not that phone.  It's faster than the previous Rugby incarnation, sure, but the charging port cover ripped apart before the first week was over, so it's no longer water-resistant.  I wasn't even being my normally rugged and neglectful self.  Also, callers cannot hear me when I hold the phone between my ~left~ shoulder and cheek, which posture I favor over other styles of passively holding the phone."
-1,"I expected silicone but instead I got a hard snap on case , and the description said silicone 😒 I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was a hard case"
1,Very impressed! High quality and super length! It shipped so fast it was unbelievable !
-1,"These are so annoying!!! When I run they slide out slowly, so I keep having to push them in every few minutes. Also, the flat wire causes for a scratch-scratch sound with every. single. step. Very obnoxious, sounds like a DJ that keeps scratching the disc."
1,I love this case looks really good everything feels great. Really tight fit premium feel also.
1,"I'm very pleased with my purchase of this product, the phone holder attaches easily to my air vent in the car and I have no issues so far. And suction cup to window or dash works also perfectly.  Would highly recommended."
-1,"Doesnt charge beyond 2nd light, defected, and doesnt come with cable for charging! Very disappointed"
1,Nice case
1,Looks just like real wood
0,I didnt probe good this phone because i receive a defective item.
1,Best low priced bluetooth on the market.
1,Excellent Thank You..
1,"This shield works in a different way- it's a bit soft, abrasions vanish after a couple of hours, returning to smooth. As in self healing. The included misting spray is great for cleaning my glasses, thanks"
1,worked great
1,"I received this product in exchange for a unbiased review,the shipping was fast and packaged securely the instructions were easy to follow and this screen protector fit my device perfectly. all ports and speakers work properly, fingerprints are easy to wipe off. i put on a case right afterwards and the screen protector didn't interfere made of durable materials and keeps my screen safe from damage. I have dropped my phone several times since and I also keep it in a large purse nice price for the durability and quantity"
1,Way too heavy to carry around! But a necessity for android phone
1,"This case was definitely worth the gamble. I bought it hoping it would fit my Droid Turbo Ballistic & it does perfectly. I'm probably going to buy multiple in different colors. This case is slim & not bulky & I'm in love with the texture of it. It's not quite plastic but almost like the nonslip grip. The only thing I did not like about this particular case is the color did not quite match up with the picture shown. I was going for a more seafoam green, but it's more of a mint or an aqua green. Other than that I can't complain."
-1,I'm having mixed reviews about this battery one day it gives me 1 day an 10 hrs of use then the next 9 hrs of use I have to remove the battery after charging to get accurate reading I shouldn't have to remove the case then the battery every time I charge the thing it's giving me a headache I'm thinking of returning the battery and going back to my old battery and carrying around a charger this battery cost to much to have to go through that every time I charge it
1,Love it
1,goob seller A+
1,Really useful to have the choice of lengths. Slow to charge.
1,"Was kind of difficulty to put on, but once on its great. ..no scratches!!"
1,"So far its been excellent! It came on time, the specs on the phone Internal storage 4.75GB, Built in storage 9.79GB and the 16GB SD card mounted. It responds to the touch. I love this phone so far!"
1,Covers arrived promptly and fit fine.
1,
1,"This works very well, for only $13 it works great to play my music while driving through the city."
0,"decent units.  i use these as my back up pair.<br />easy to use, comfortable, sound okay. not a lot of volume.<br />the Active2's are far superior and are my go to, more volume and far superior bass response.<br />i would recommend them over these."
1,Good quality at a nice price
-1,Effects the car battery
1,Super handy and light weight. This is great for outdoors use and camping and survival. A must to have in a bug out bag or disaster box. It is covered in a rubber like skin and has rubber plug covers that protect the usb ports from water. It has 2 usb ports to change two items at one time. It can be charged up with an external usb2 power supply or by it's built in solar panel.  It has a D ring included that allows you to hang it off the side of a tent or wall facing the sun so it can charge up. It's water proof so even if it rains when you leave it out for charging it wont be ruined. This solar charger is about the size of a large smart phone and a little thicker. I bought mine at a discount for an honest and fair review. I would say no different about this at it current price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.) Solar power portable.<br />2.) Water proof<br />3.) Rubber guard skin<br />4.) Portable and pack-able.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.) Not enough power to charge my ipad. It will charge all phones and some tablets.<br /><br />Pics:
1,"I bought this from the DeYoung website because it is the only place I could find it for the Galaxy S5.  The case is hard,  it does have a little bit of a lip to help protect the screen. It is extremely beautiful,  the colors are vibrant, and I get compliments on it all the time!"
1,Good product.
1,They are wonderful. I use them to exercise. I sweat alot and they are working just as good as when I bought them.
-1,"These wouldn't stay in while I was running; at one point, the rubber earpiece stayed in my ear while the actually headphone slipped out. Also, the signal would cut out every time I adjusted my backpack which my phone was in.  I really wanted to enjoy these, but I had to send them back."
1,"Just as described, no defects whatsoever! Will buy from you again!"
1,Nice and slim. Sturdy
1,exactly what the doctor ordered.  Lots of length and works with the Apple Ipad.  I say this because sometimes this aftermarket stuff isn't compatible.
1,"To be upfront about this, I did receive this case for free in order to write a review.  That does not change nor influence my opinion on this product.<br /><br />Really enjoying this new case. Prior to this, I had been using an OB case. While I love the protection that case offers, it tends to allow dust under the screen protector. I usually have the phone in my pocket, so dust can occur quite easily. So far I have not experienced dust under the screen protector.  The screen protector does not have the same 'trampoline' feel that the OB case has.<br /><br />Getting the hard shell off the softer part of the case was not the easiest thing to do, but it was not challenging. This is to ensure a good, solid fit, and it really helps ensure that this is a high-quality and secure case.<br /><br />I really like that there are included the three different colored back pieces.  I would, however, like to see the colors match the color of the iPhone itself.  I have the gold color and the colors are close, but do not match.  Since there's the hole in the back to display the Apple logo, you can see the color difference.  I cannot comment on the two other colors and how they compare.  I don't actually care about this, and it does not detract from the quality of the product at all.<br /><br />When changing the back piece, there may need to be a little extra 'attention' to getting all the edges flush, but with minor effort, it's no problem.  Again, the little extra bit of work pays off in that the edges are solid and tight and help ensure that there's less gap for debris to get in.<br /><br />The flaps that cover the slots are easy to open and close.  If I had to mention a detraction it would be that the cover for the headphone slot can occasionally be a little tricky to get re-seated, but it does go in.  Just might take a little attention and not something you can do mindlessly.<br /><br />I will be keeping my phone in this case.  It's great."
1,Love this case!  Very durable and cute.  My phone doesn't look too big in this case.  I've dropped it a couple of times and it still looks great.  I highly recommend this case.<br /><br />I recieved this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
1,Really good sound. I use this in my office and it is a great buy for the money.
1,works fine & costs less than the Motorola unit.
1,A+++!!! Epic seller!!!
1,"The rubber cover never fit just right, but I like it. Trimming a small piece of cloth for between the phone and the caes would keep the phone scratch free. The case fits exactly to the phone, so daily dirt gets in there and scratches the back."
1,So far so good. All of the batteries works well for this note 4. No problems thus far.
1,Great!
1,Best one you can buy!
1,"Base on other reviews I was not sure about the product; yet I am glad to have made the purchase. The case is incredibly resistant, and it also looks well made."
1,Works as intended and doesn't feel like it is going to break.<br /><br />I can't use it on my car's air vents because this is too heavy for them. Sucks for me but not the product's fault.
1,love it
1,"Fits great, looks nice good price"
1,"I love this player as a great accompaniment to my Nokia Lumia 1020. It charges perfectly, connects easy, and has great sound. Definite fan of this product for sure."
1,Not bad at all.
1,Cheap phone for a senior... It works and works well.  .. If you loose it you wont care due to the price. .. Only bad thing is the weird charging cord that reminds me of technology from 10 years ago.
1,Wokrs great
1,"The product was exactly as described in the ad and arrived sooner than expected.  My iPad and Bluetooth printer fix snugly and th ere is space to carry headphones, etc. in the outer pocket."
0,Had it a short time and it's starting to show wear
1,The magnetic holder is super convenient and has great holding power.  The suction mount is stronger and more stable than similar products I've used.  Very happy and would recommend this to anyone.
1,"This is my first time using a glass screen protector for my phone and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />I opened it up and found a nice thick piece of glass that is free from any scratches or dust. I was able to get it installed on my phone quickly and easily, since the cleansing and drying cloths are already included in the package I had everything I would need.<br /><br />Once I got the screen protector on, I loved the fact that it is crystal clear and it didn't even look like I had added anything to my phone.There were no bubbles and I could still use my touch screen just like before. I really like knowing that I have the added protection now in case of bumps or drops. I received one to review and I can say with 100% certainty that it DOES WORK. Unfortunately for me, I dropped my phone shortly after putting the screen protector on. Luckily for me, thanks to this screen protector, my phone was completely unharmed. Very glad to have it!"
1,"Outstanding item.  I've bought 2.<br /><br />If you have a phone case, you can easily adhere the (thin) metal plate to the inside of the case, if you are worried about applying it directly to your phone.  The magnet (that clips to your air vent) is strong enough to make it through your case.  I have a semi-thick plastic case on mine and it works great enough to hold the phone in either straight-up or landscape, without problem.  In addition, in straight-up position, the magnet is strong enough to hold the phone while plugged in for charging as well.  I use it in my car and carry an extra magnet in my bag for travel (for rental cars).  Works so well.<br /><br />Would only suggest not to use this if you keep your credit cards in your phone case, for obvious (magnetic) reasons.  But if you do not use your phone case for storage of your CC's.... this is an awesome product."
1,"Even though it's rubber and flexible, it fits like a glove and protects the iPod!"
-1,Mines stop working in a week
1,Good for the price
1,Love this little product! Great sound and buying more!
1,These are clearly not worth the list price (before markdown) but for super cheap they are great.
1,"Great cover, dropped my phone from around 3ft 3 times so far and not a single problem.  All buttons and holes line up perfectly with 100% of screen viewable.  Backing has minor gripping compared to all metal or plastic cases."
-1,Cheaply made rubber like outer covering. Would prefer the thicker PVC vinyl covering which is smooth and easier to handle.<br />Will not re-order.
0,"First of all, I want to point out the following pros and cons. I actually bought mine from Best Buy because I wanted a decent dash-cam that I can return if I disliked it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cheap<br /><br />2. Not hard to install, and with the very long cable it can go anywhere. You can mount it traditionally on the front of your vehicle, or all the way to the very back of your rear windows. Whoever put this together put a lot of thought into the size of the vehicle of the customer. It's long enough where I was able to stuff it under my center armrest/storage (where carpet meets plastic), and it still had 2 to 3 more feet as it goes back up my rear seat to my rear window.<br /><br />3. Much better performance than I expected. I normally expected that half the time the camera will be offline due to some crappy memory card error, or software bug, or resetted back to some unreadable foreign language that most of these obscurely branded device manufacturers tend to have. But as long as you have a reliable connection to your cigarette lighter, you should be fine.<br /><br />4. Large recording capacity for its relatively low micro-SD card capacity that it came with: Out of a 8GB memory card that was included, I got more than an hour of recording, which completely embarrasses my front-mounted Abeo HDVR (my mirror-cam) that has similar performance and night/day quality, and yet can only record 2 hours while gobbling up all 32 GB of my regular SD card. At least, if securely connected, the H50 can film directly in front without suffering from heat issues (so far) or constant pause-records.<br /><br />5. The author of the manual speaks English. In fact, the manufacturers of the device all speak perfect English. The manual is clear and understandable, and there is little &#34;foreign terminology&#34; for everyday things you buy in the United States (TransFlash instead of MicroSD) If you mounted the device in the back like I did, I didn’t need to turn my head around to look for the green light to verify that it’s working. When you start your car, it will say “Have a safe drive today!”, followed up a few seconds later with… “Continuous recording begins now!”. The website was horrible however, and it took me hours of going through the support page before I realized that the avi converter is in the included microSD card.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. One chance to &#34;get it right&#34; on the mounting. But I will admit, I shouldn’t have assumed that the manual was all-inclusive. And those adhesives that came originally on the plastic mount are ungodly strong. This was one incident that completely annoyed me as I was mounting the plastic mount onto my rear windows. My intent was to have a “car interior cam” that is still facing me, but can view a wider angle on the sides of my car as well as acting as a witness in the event of a car accident, by showing that I did everything I can to avoid crashing.<br /><br />However, the clear plastic mount only goes “one-way” (you won't be able to plug it in if you reverse the camera, without bending the power cord) and I never “test-mounted” the HD50 by making sure it was facing “the right way” before permanently mounting it. What ensued was a hilarious debacle of frustration as I pulled out a flathead screwdriver as soon as I got home to “pry” it off, causing the mount adhesive to rip off a portion of my rear window’s plastic tint along with it (about soda can sized). It didn’t matter to me though, my tint was falling off anyways. And if some idiot tailgater with those high-beams or HID things pull up really close, they can tell that I am recording them because I positioned it right over where there was no more tint.<br /><br />2. Uses its own proprietary format that must be converted using it's built-in format-to-avi conversion software, there is no online software version you can download. You must search for it inside the memory card's file folders, and hopefully make a backup of both the executable and the .dll file onto your PC. Also, and this happened to me at least once, but constantly fiddling with the settings and downloading your driving videos off of it will sometimes prompt your dashcam to force you to reformat it as soon as you plug it back in. You will lose everything else you didn’t save that was on the memory card. But from what I heard from Googling, it will also install the necessary software like the avi converter through the formatting.<br /><br />3. Requires a PC to change settings. Handling the micro-SD can be pretty tricky, especially since it’s a black one and if your car’s interior is also black. However, there is a micro-SD converter, two different types that you can use. A converter-to-USB 2.0/3.0 and a standard sized SD-card that you can slip it into the back and then plug it into your PC. Which are also black, so don't drop any of them. I am certain that changing settings using the PC software will force your camera to format it again.<br /><br />4. By default, a hyper-sensitive bump/event notification and you need to use the manufacturer’s software with the memory card plugged into your PC to make it stop. It’s a elevator chime-like sound, and it will get annoying pretty quick. Each time your car goes over a pothole, speed bump, ant carrying a pebble, or a relatively smooth up-and-down inclination it will do that “bong” noise.<br /><br />At first, I thought it was really funny how it was converting unpleasant noises into much nicer ones. But if you drive a stick like I do, and you had a slightly rough start from a red light, it’ll bong to that too. Even a downshift from 5th to 4th to overtake a grandma on the leftmost lane will make it go bong. Swerving around a accident occurring right in front of you, and it’ll bong to that.<br /><br />5. Does not have a internal battery. It requires a direct connection to your cigarette lighter port for it to work, or you can have someone hardwire it. It will make your rotation and usage of your OTHER car appliances a pain. For example, I have four “car-appliances” and two cigarette lighter “splitters”.

1,My son has a Lg Optimus.<br />He is always dropping his phone and has has even got a small chip on the corner of the glass.<br />I purchased this for him to put his phone in so that it will be well protected and easy for him to use.<br />He has no problem accessing any features of his phone now.<br />This case is light weight and i love that it has a viewing window on the front of the cover so you can see the clock or notifications.<br />It is stylish and he loves it.<br />His phone now is safe and sound against drops .<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. However I don't just give glowing reviews to a product just because i received it free or a discount. If my review helped you in any way please click
1,Very good quality!
0,"If all you plan to take with you is a credit card and ID, this is a great little carry case.  If you are hoping to use it to carry cash as well, don't expect to carry much or closing this will be difficult.  It does hold the phone securely and I was able to take photos with no problem.  It worked for what I needed it for which was something small to carry on vacation, however I did use a little bigger purse to carry my extra cash, cards & essentials.  For now it's back in the closet, will re-access later."
1,"Extremely well designed case, as expected from BlackBerry.<br />Useful, elegant, protects well the phone. Real leather. I do recommend it."
-1,I purchased this case and it did not  fit my phone.
0,Goes on pretty easy... easily scratched and marred...
0,I ordered these by mistake. They get caught in my hair and come off easily.
0,The case is excellent and just like the supcase one I was replacing.  Unfortunately the HOT PINK looks more red to me than pink.  I should have ordered the white as I started to do.
1,"bought this as part of my husbands birthday gift and it arrived on time, product is great...you can change colors to match with your clothes."
1,Awesome product. It comes all together. All you have to do is put your motherboard and parts back in it. You don't have to pull your old home key and buttons off your old phone. I had mine rebuilt in a15-20 mins. I know how to replace my glass but if you don't this is the product for you. Clear brand new looking image. I would give this more stars if I could.
1,Works great.
1,My daughter loves this selfie stick.  She had purchased a much cheaper one and it did not work very well.  This selfie stick has a solid feel and seems very sturdy.  The clamps appear very secure.  The blue tooth paired with her iPhone very easily and quickly.
1,For the price and quality this is the best but I have found for a glass screen protector! I will buy more and recommend this product. It also comes with cleaning wipes and tape to take the lint off before applying the screen protector
1,If you have some USB devices that you utilize in your car then you need this.
0,Very Stylish and extremely durable/ portable<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Stylish<br />- Discrete (not gaudy/ loud/ or annoying)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Magnet is not powerful enough to hold in place all phones (my 6&#34; phone constantly slips)<br />- Does not work well with phone cases
-1,"Galaxy S6 Active, if you don't know, is a heavily durable marvel of a phone with a bit of extra coating -- but not so much that it's heavier than any other case.  Unfortunately, this charging station is so ridiculously finnicky that you can have the charger perfectly lined up and have the charging light at a perfect solid green and still have no charge.<br /><br />I've left my phone on this for over a half hour.  I come back to a 5% battery.  No seriously, it was 10% when I put it on there.  Even when you spend five minutes lifting it up and putting it back down over and over to ensure the light is green and the phone actually recognizes it (these are two separate things, by the way -- the light can be green and your phone won't know there's a charger there), you still need to be certain that it's doing anything by monitoring it.  I did both of these, still 5%.  It was plugged directly into an outlet, too, so there was zero interference or loss of power.<br /><br />I was looking forward to this product and had my hopes up.  Unfortunately this is worst product I have ever purchased.  The wired cord that comes with it is significantly more reliable, works every time without the wireless base, so it's definitely the charger itself."
-1,"one star<br /><br />I hate to give a one star...Took the phone to be repaired by a professional... Long story short, I was sold a bad screen & requested a refund."
1,Excellent case for my LG G3 with an additional cover. Well pleased with this case.
1,"It fits my Apple Sports watch so much! I actually like the look of this more than the original Apple Watch Space Grey with the Steel Band and that costs $1200 after tax! This band is really well made , very comfortable and looks so much nicer . I love the stitching detail."
1,cute little case
1,"fits perfect, looks nice too, very classic and outstanding."
1,Nice
1,"It fits the phone well and the rubber sides do not easily bend back - I have the clear one which is actually a little bit different model than the colored ones. However, after several weeks the sides turned a brownish color, which is not very attractive. After about 6 months it bothered me too much and I purchased a different case (leather one from Apple - love it). Also, the back is not scratch resistant like it says - it is plastic after all so I never expected it to resist scratches. Overall, the case protects well, especially for the price. But if you get the all clear just know it will change over time."
-1,I wish this case was made better! Both layers are a hard plastic that does not work well with each other. Me and my husband got this same case for different phones in different colors and we both had the same problem. Our phones kept popping out the case. Whether it was a corner or one of the sides for some reason it wouldn't stay put. I honestly think its because the case is 2 hard plastics together vs. the alt silicone/gel base and hard plastic cover. We loved the idea of having the kick stand and the cool look but being functional is always top priority! I mean what's the use of added features to a car that doesn't drive??
0,that's nice and simple to assembly.
1,Love it
-1,This battery was not an original Samsung and caused the phone to turn off and on sporadically. I could not use it.
1,perfect
1,This is an all around win win situation! My order arrived on time as promised. Extremely easy to apply. No glare or distortions. So relieved that my phones screen is now protected. I have recommended the Pleson tempered glass screen proctor to my friends.
1,"Great battery.  The unit charges 4 usb items at once.  It's been great to keep both my phones, Ipod, and any other device I need to top off charged while in airports or on planes, or in business meetings where power is unavailable.<br /><br />Great customer service.  15 months into use, the unit still held a charge, however it would not output power to my devices.  Emailed Anker with the issue, and they are sending a replacement free of charge.  Thanks Anker!"
1,"Fits the lg g2 vs980 version good, the strips were not as vibrant as pictured."
-1,The product broke after a week of use
1,I order this for my boss to find different jobs. He liked it so much I oder anther one for his other truck.
-1,"HORRIBLE,  waited an insane amount of time and the tablet doesn't even stay in. It's loose and very poorly made! The Stylus cushion fell off within days! Definitely got what we paid for!"
1,does its job well
1,Fit well. Dont plan on taking it off though
-1,Poorly made but I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Product is exactly as described. It fits the watch perfectly and looks great.
-1,"Followed the instructions, destroyed my phone, cost me $400 to get a new phone. Bad idea! I have replaced screens on kindles successfully, don't use this kit."
1,holds a charge for a long time and charges my phone rapidly
1,works well and protects my phone! very happy.
0,It is a so so transmitter. The sound quality is mediocre and all channels have noise. There is no dingle channel where the sound is very clear.
1,Great product. I love it.  It charges my phone quickly and looks great too.
0,"I love how adjustable this is, and it seems like it would be very secure, as other reviewers note ... if I could get the thing to latch properly. The first time I tried to lower the lever in the back to anchor it down, the lever popped off, and I couldn't get it to work at all. After fussing with it a lot for about a week, it finally randomly stuck, and I was not about to mess with it!<br /><br />I used it happily for over a month and loved it, but then it just popped off again - I didn't hit a bump, touch it, or anything, it just let go, sending my phone for a ride while I was driving. I can't get it back on for the life of me.<br /><br />So I took a closer look at each piece, and it turns out that the latch looks defective. The plastic parts that should poke into the little holes of the stand, anchoring the joint in place, are warped and useless. One side is just straight, flush with the rest of the part, and so doesn't do anything, and the other side looks like it was melted and bent inward, resulting in a bulge way too big to fit in the hole. I have no idea how this thing held on for a month, and don't expect it to again.<br /><br />It seems like an awesome product, but I'm disappointed with the defective workmanship. I'd still consider another one."
1,Good for the money
1,Dad loved it
1,"Great looking ,durable case. I bought one for myself then a second for my daughter after really liking mine.<br />Fast service.<br />Would do business with them again."
1,"nice looking, holds phone well, stash a credit card and a few bills when going out!"
1,Worked like a charm.
1,"This case was so easy to put on my cell phone, fits like a glove. I have only had this cell phone case for a month but, I would have no problems recommending this cell phone case to anyone."
-1,Cheap plastic. Tore very easily. Does not stay in place.
0,"the inner plastic shell snaps on really tight and the outer rubber gives it a good grip. Unfortunately, the bottom charging port cover doesn't align quite right with the phone and the top headphone jack cover is starting to tear after just a couple uses."
1,Love it! Great fit -a gel case not a plastic case like I thought.
1,Great product
1,This case is great! Its super slim and fits perfect and offers great drop protection.
-1,Broke after 2 weeks.
1,"Really great stylus.  I especially like the more narrow tip.  One small disadvantage when compared with a broader-tipped stylus is that I have to press and hold the &#34;back arrow&#34; on the lower-right of the device to get it to work (this is a Galaxy Note 4).  With the broader-tipped stylus, it was more of just a tap.  Anyway, given the choice, I'll stick with these.  Oh, and I also like the included replacement tips."
1,"It's pretty bulky, but I lived with that.  The kickstand is pretty flimsy and broke after a few months.  It did it's job, for the price it's not bad but I ordered a different one as a replacement."
1,I love this device!!!
-1,"Should have listened to the poor reviews on this item. Did not work from the first attempt. Dont waste your time or money, please."
1,Husband loves if.
-1,This was just an iPhone part
-1,It was too big
1,"Nice phone.Amazing long life battery and sweet custom os color, white and orange, looks cool.<br />It's will be 5 starts if Blu developer team update phone to Lollipop as they promise in june."
-1,"My items has stopped working after day 4. I reset, and reset, and deleted app, and reset and charged, and blah blah. It won't syn the correct time anymore. It will count steps but I won't sync with my iPhone 5. I was excited for something so cheap! BUT I got what I paid for. :("
0,"tiny metal ring where the lanyard clips onto has already come off, and a bit of color is fading, but otherwise decently made."
1,Fits great. Not too thick. Easy to take off but stays on securely. I've had 2 othe glow in the dark cases and this one glows the brightest.
1,I received a discount on my order for a fair review and this is one of  the best car chargers I had thus far. I am normally picky about what chargers I purchase but this one charges my phone really fast. I don't really have time to charge my phone from the time I get in the car till the time I get out. I recommend this charger to anyone that needs to go from 0 to 100 really quickly.
1,This was for my husband's phone and he loves it.  Would order again.
1,"Nice case. It protects well, fits credit cards and more. Love the color and everything about it."
1,okay
1,Great product
1,"A super thin metal plate inside my phone cover and that's it. The magnet grabs and holds the phone in place. It's strong. Everybody that sees it, thinks it's very cool."
0,Wonderful case except in putting in on one day I broke a clip off and now it's hard to keep case shut.
1,well
1,Great headset sleek and sharp you'll love it.
1,I think I've finally found the place where I'll order all chargers from now on.  Really nice product!
1,Easy to put on and just what I was looking for.  Price very good in comparison to Apple product.
1,"Love it so far, no complaints!!"
1,"Perfect fit, stylish and gets alot of compliments."
1,Great product
-1,has no button to take the picture sucks
1,I absolutely loved it and it looks like the exact picture!
1,Excellent graphic and very durable
1,"This antenna Is a great upgrade,  with it I am able to pick up transmissions out to about 50 miles away."
0,This item stopped working after 3 weeks.
1,helps reduce clutter
1,Works very well...
1,Ok
1,The item works fine I would go in another one .
1,Works great!
1,Good product.
1,Stylish protection for your phone.
1,Tha box alone is worth it
1,"I Love it, highly recommend had the case before phone arrived so it was ready. Once in the case which was a job but completely understood for what kind of impact it can take. I dropped my phone within 3 hours and was in shock cause it landed face down!!!!! But it was perfectly fine not a scratch or anything very happy with my new case Thank you"
-1,item received broken.
-1,I ordered mine and it has a sharp ring to it when I connect my phone to it and it won't stop no matter what station I set it too
1,The sound is clear and it performs as well as any other name brand device.
0,"The car mount is made well and holds my phone (iPhone 6) firmly. But, the ball which allows 360 rotation caused the phone to be too far away from the vent grip. After a while, due to the weight of the phone it leans forward. I would say overall a good product which does the job."
1,This is what I wanted and it worked perfectly and continues to work perfectly.
1,Works awesome
1,"Great case fpr me.  Most of the time I carry my phone in my pocket and the aluminum is light, thin and protective.  Perfect."
0,Came on time iPhone look good with it.!
1,"Excellent quality of stand and packaging, well made, included lightning cable built in, which was a pleasant surprise.<br />Would buy again and strongly recommend.<br />Just waiting for watchOS 2 so I can use nightstand mode on the Apple Watch while charging, stand should be compatible with feature based on the angle it is held at."
1,This is my 2 koolkase and I absolutely love them! They fit my phone perfect and look exactly like the picture! I won't use anything else from now on.
1,"Great, better than the original"
1,best phone I've ever had
1,"This is a great little stereo kit. I put this setup in a cooler for a float trip and now I will have to order more because several people I know want me to make them on.  Pros: - Kit includes everything you need to wire up the amp and speakers, plus has an aux hookup for phones, iPods, etc. - Speakers are decently loud and clear. As long as you don't play bass heavy music and have the volume cranked to max, these little speakers sound decent. - The amp is really small so it can fit in tight places (such as a cooler), or on an ATV or motorcycle.  Cons: - The volume knob it comes with is not very good. If you barely touch it the volume goes up drastically. Also a normal knob would increase gradually from 8 oclock to 4 oclock with 8 being off and 4 being maxed out. This knob maxes out around 11 oclock and the rest of the way does nothing. It doesn't get louder. This isn't a huge deal, just something I wanted to point out to people. - The waterproof bag that is meant to hold a cellphone or iPod is pretty small. Any modern cellphone in a case will probably not fit in the bag. You will have to remove the case most likely. My Galaxy S4 in a case wouldn't fit in the bag unfortunately.  Summary: This is a great kit for the money. If you are expecting super loud music that is as clear as a concert you are looking at the wrong product. I would like to remind everybody that the speakers are about $10 a piece and you truly do get what you pay for. I do believe that most people will enjoy this product if they keep in mind just how cheap it is. This kit works great for someone looking for some music in their boat, atv, or cooler. If you need something cheap, that doesn't sound too bad and is decently loud; go ahead and get this product. You won't be disappointed."
0,"Nice, rugged case, but the rubber is a little too grippy, so I found it to be a little too hard to get in and out of the holster.  Sure, you don't want it to fall out, but it should be a little easier to get out."
0,"The Good:  It works.<br /><br />The Bad:  First and foremost, no mounting screws.  I spent an extra hour or two trying to find screws to fit this stereo with the adapter I had to use to install it in my Ford Explorer.  I finally found some that fit, installed the deck, and it slid back inside the dash when I finished because the screws I scrounged up don't fit exactly right and are too loose.  What the heck, you can't even include a set of screws with a stereo?  Very annoyed by this.  Secondly the MP3 navigation system is abysmal.  Good luck trying to figure out what's in what folder...  it just puts all your MP3s in a huge stack and you get to have fun guessing what might be where by entering in numbers from 1 to 700 etc etc if you have a big memory card.  And what's with the radio having good sound and the MP3s sounding bassless?  Wishing I spent the extra money to buy a better unit."
1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjw2-Hn6fVs
1,This works perfectly.  Holds your phone securely.
1,works great holds a charge for me all week
1,Perfect fit for me.
1,"I've never owned a selfie stick honestly, so this is the first one actually but I will say this much, the photobomb selfie stick is really convienant for me to use, there's no extra wires attached to get in the way. And the photobomb selfie stick completely supports my iphone when in place so in not worried about my phone falling and getting damaged because it's securely held into place using padding to so now scratches occur while placing it into the selfie stick. I totally love the photobomb selfie stick and will be using this everyday. I also highly reccomend purchasing one if you haven't already, not only is this a great item I got it for an unbeatable price with the exchange of a review and last but not least the shipping was super fast. Thanks"
-1,WAY TOO BIG
1,Works exactly as expected
1,Great buy
1,"Stylish and comes with an ink pen inside which is great for those at the moment, quickies or to sign a check, but who does that anymore? Anyway, you have to give a firm push when using this stylus. It doesn't sense the pen or rather the screen fast as I'd like it to...like the note4 phone. But it looks good and matches my<br /> Pwr+ Silver Metal Pivoting Flex Ipad Stand Holder."
1,"I got this free for testing and review purposes ,  I really like it High quality"
1,"Came quickly, good quality and husband likes a lot.  Thanks Cell-Nerds!"
-1,The colors on the case were smearing into other colors when I got it. Not worth the money.
1,"exactly what we needed, received in a timely fashion."
1,It didn't come with the GPS software CD.
1,It was excellent. I love it
1,"I have to say, this product is a amazing. I have been using iCarez products for a few years now and it's never disappointing. The installation was super easy. My tip's on installing is a choose clean room. Pre close the room windows, and doors 1hr before installation, Dust floats everywhere around. So the less you move,and good lighting so you can spot any dust before in the pealing of the installation the better it will go. Mine was 99.9% perfect. I would recommend this product over anything! : )"
1,"Efficient, while not the nicest design. But the &#34;excess&#34; in texture and decoration makes it easier to grasp, TBT..."
1,"This mount is great! Not too bulky, works amazing on cars with shorter front windows, bigger phones work perfect on this, iPhone 6Plus and Galaxy S6! Doesn't work on my dashboard but having it on the window is no problem! I stick it on my bathroom mirror to hold my phone and listen to my music when I shower, its great, now My phone doesn't get wet. I like how the swivel feels so secure, doesn't wiggle around while driving. Love how the clamp works! some crack easily but this one seems so tough."
-1,Broke the 4th day I had it and second using it
1,Looks cool and works well
1,It's great the have a 90 degree cable. I love it!
1,Love it
1,Love
1,"Awesome screen protector. :)  incredibly easy to apply,  and that's coming from someone who has no hand-eye coordination."
1,"I was a bit worried when ordering this as I read some of the comments stating this case did not fit properly. There were also comments stating the back of the phone needed to be removed in order for the case to fit properly. I found neither of these statements to be true.<br /><br />The case fit snugly with the original back on the phone and all buttons worked properly. I think the reason for the reviews stating the case did not fit is simply that this case is for the 1st generation Moto E released in 2014. If you are unsure which case you have, you should check your model number to be certain before ordering.<br /><br />I am 100% satisfied, and received my case one day earlier that expected. Would recommend to anyone with a 1st generation Moto E that needs more than just a soft silicon case to protect against drops."
1,I love this case but wish it had a handle connected to case for carring
-1,Only received half of the case. Very angry! !
1,"Worked well, easy to install and does protect screen. You do have to wipe down the protector a lot."
1,"Used this for two years before the rubber sides started detaching from the metal backing. Dropped my phone many times, but this little beauty protected it well! A job well done."
1,I like the service it's fast<br />And the products are awesome prices can't ask for less<br />It's the first time I buy from amazon<br />I love it
1,"This case is very well made and designed fitting the phone beautifully. This case offers a very high level of protection for both phone and screen from water as well as dust, dirt or accidental damage. The case is both easy to fit and remove. When fitted you are still able to utilize all buttons and ports- afterwards just ensure to properly fit the protective seals so that the case remains waterproof.Overall this is a very well made and designed case which is both easy to fit and remove. The case provides a very high level of protection from water as well as dust, dirt and accidental damage. Highly recommend."
-1,"did not like them, every time I plugged it into my nav system a message came across that it was not charging so I sent them back"
1,Simple to mount and use.  Works great.  Excellent price (on sale).
1,For me daughter.  She loves it.
1,"I love this case so much. It's wonderful, but it's slightly cheaply made. The printing doesn't line up on it very well, but regardless I love it. The shape hugs the frame and its so adorable. I've gotten a lot of laughs and compliments from it. Thank you! :)"
1,good!
1,better than expected!  5 stars!
1,Works great and it's pretty rugged.
1,It Works Just Like The Original...I Love Anker Products!!! This Is My 10th Item Bought From Them With Absolutely No Complains..
1,Good case
1,It's working out very well.
1,"Great price. I thought phone would come on, when case was opened up."
1,The cord is super long and it works great!<br />Exactly as expected.
1,I love it!

1,"Tried the Freefly VR at my friend’s house and I was absolutely blown away.<br /><br />We used it for mobile vr gaming so it was tethered to the pc and trinus gyre with moonlight used to stream to a galaxy s6 phone.<br /><br />The ease of use is a good plus. I’ve also tried the homido before, I can say without a doubt that Freefly is a lot better and I mean a lot.<br /><br />It’s easy to calibrate, more comfortable, looks very professional, awesome customer service and fast replies, you get a free controller with it, and I can go on... The only thing that the homido has and I wished Freefly had was a way to adjust the IPD, I’m not gonna lie that is a really good feature.<br /><br />Hope the next version of Freefly will have this as well! Although I must say the lenses of the Freefly are very big and a very high quality! Thanks for an awesome product guys."
1,Sleek and stylish.
-1,Obviously it is a cheap case but it looks more cheap in person than on these pictures. I ended up just throwing it away.
-1,Too much hissing
1,very useful
1,Cute! Cheap! & fits!
-1,"Poor, feel apart after first use"
-1,Design peeled off 2 weeks after in use
1,"This was a gift for my daughter due her frequent traveling.  Its a very significant piece of equipment but she is enjoying, plus she likes being able to help her friends by charging their devices as well.  This is long lasting even after most portable chargers are dead this one is still going."
1,The case does exactly as I had hoped.  I have taken my phone in and out several times and have had no problems putting it in or removing it.  It won't hold a lot of cash but it serves my purpose and keeps everything handy and together.
-1,Had to return.
1,"Great price, easy to use.  I thought I ordered the blue unit, received the green one instead."
1,Long lasting and a great product.  I recommend it.
1,"My daughter loves this case! It shipped fast, it's cute and is sturdy so it will protect her phone from normal teenage life. the price was outstanding considering how durable the case is!"
-1,Does not work.  Can't change the channel.  I am sending it back.
1,I receive it on time I  working good with that  SamsungTelephone
0,These cables are okay but they are loose fitting with some devices.The wire is kind of flimsy. I would not call them premium but they didn't cost a lot. My kids are careless with them usually stepping on the ends or the puppy chewing the wires so they are a big help.
-1,"The back is not that great, the glue has already started to detach. I have had the phone a few weeks! Also the battery dies constantly. As a matter of fact as of this moment .....the phone will not turn on at all...I have no idea why! I tried to take the back off and that too is a pain! I would not purchase this phone again! I actually would like my money back for this one!!!!!!"
1,"Perfect solution to hold my iPhone 6 Plus with case in my 2014 Hyundai Tucson. Sturdy, too."
1,The charger is great in terms of how easy it was to manage multiple devices for more than 1 person on a long international trip.  My only complaint was that the on/off switch stopped functioning about halfway through the trip and I had to unplug it from the wall whenever I wanted to turn it off.
-1,"Don't waste your money buying this phone. I could use the phone only a year. its a total crap, no signal at all. I paid 165 dollars to fix broken screen. 4 month later I got trouble finding mobile signal and a week later no signal at all. After contacting customer care, they told me I again have to pay about 150 box to repair my phone signal problem. I'm so upset and thinking to buy another phone, absolutely not from LG."
1,Great cords
1,Worked just fine.
1,"This little stand is so handy! I look up recipes a lot on my phone and refer to them in the kitchen. I am constantly having to wash my hands and pick up my phone to read/view what to do next. With this little stand, I can sinply attach my phone and put the stand on my counter. I do not worry at all that my phone will fall. The suction is very reliable and strong. The pieces were very easy to assemble and stay together well. I have also found my son using this to put his ipod on while he watches videos. This is a nice little device to have around. I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange of an honest review."
-1,dont get it
1,As Promised
1,Great product!  No problems. Don't buy anything else. This is all you need.
-1,Fell apart after a couple of days. But worked well while it lasted.
1,"Fast delivery. Amazing case, fits my phone perfectly and gives it an even more simple yet attractive look. Caseology always delivers."
1,My son loved it.
-1,This case broke in less than a week. The only reason for giving it two stars was the team design on back was pretty cool.
1,great charger just like the one that comes with a htc phones
1,I had a little feedback on the phones that I ship to members of the family and this phone was very very good they loved it no bad complain Thanks
1,I love the length ....
1,"Have not used it much yet, but appears to be a very handy power supply."
1,"If you want a clear case to still see the true look of your phone while still having some protection against scratches and small drops at a reasonable price, this is the product for you. It's cost-effective, fits perfectly, and still allows you to see the actual iPhone itself. The built in caps for the audio jack and lightning port are great as well to keep dust and lint out while the phone is in your pocket.<br /><br />This case won't be the most rugged or perfect case you'll find, but for the price it works as expected."
1,Exactly what we needed and works great!
1,"This is an absolutely gorgeous case. My hubby has been whinging about having a hard time finding a cool case for his LG, and this one fit the bill. He likes that he can get it in a color besides black ( I picked out the blue for him). You don't have to put this on your phone as a whole new case, your phone just pops right in. It's sturdy and withstands some pretty bad drops- he's a klutz- it went down the stairs last night and his phone is just fine. LG's have the most dainty little screens- they will shatter if you look at them funny, so that was pretty impressive. It sticks to his magnetic car mount and will stay open if you want to use it as a kickstand. The quick circle opening is great, you don't have to open the case when you want to check the time or see who's calling. It also has a handy dandy slot for your ID or credit card so you can take just the necessities when exercising or walking the dog or whatevs.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount necessary to facilitate my honest review. No other forms of payment were or will be received."
1,"Ive had this charger for over a year, it is very durable. It is starting to get bent by the charger part (from over use), it still works, though!"
-1,Rubber on the case started to take the screen protector off the phone
1,Love my power backup :D
1,"I'm fine with this cable being a little on the heavy side, and not really wrapping up as nicely as the other &#34;regular&#34; cables.  I'll trade the portability for something that's going to last.  But this didn't last.  After only a handful of uses (4), the Lightning connector broke right off in my phone.  Luckily, I keep a multi-tool in the car, and was able to get it out.<br />These cables aren't cheap, and I was hoping this would be the last one I'd have to buy.  The regular Apple and Belkin cables lasted much longer than these.<br />Very disappointed.<br />****UPDATE****<br />Okay, I have to say their customer service is great!  They explained the situation to me, and replaced both of my cables (only one broke so far, but they replaced both just in case the other one broke) and explained the situation to me.  It seems that there was a fault in the initial production run that caused the breakage, but that's all worked out, and the updated product works as it should.<br />I'm giving this 5 stars now, because they obviously care about their products and want to ensure that they stand behind them.  They've gone above and beyond to make sure things are right, and I appreciate that.<br />I'll update this review if I find anything worthy of an update, but I'm very happy with this cable so far.<br />Love it!"
1,Nice and fast shipping
1,"Update 11/2: I dropped my phone pretty bad with no case on and I got two hairline scratches across the phone and when I removed the screen protector there wasn't any damage on the phone!<br />I am so happy to switch from a plastic protective firm to a glass protector. I had a misconception that glass screen protectors had a complicated application process, however applying a glass protector isn't different from applying a plastic screen protector. I say it's a must have for the chance that I could drop my phone and the screen protector would take all the damage and the screen protector would pay for itself. I like how the protector doesn't change the clarity or feel of the LG G3 screen. Plus, this screen protector covers the bottom bezel which makes the screen protector less noticeable.<br />*Sample provided for review. I was not compensated for a positive review."
1,Great smart watch! Own the original Pebble and this is definitely a step forward! You won't be disappointed!
1,"Love this product, very nice."
1,works great
0,I ORDERED THE WRONG ONE I WAS TRYING TO ORDER THE GLASS COVER
-1,Bought this in advance of a trip to Europe to charge multiple devices with one charger versus carrying multiple chargers.<br />Didn't work. Now I'm back and I can't return.<br />Don't waste your money on this.
1,Excellent!
1,"Great and excellent product, protect excellent the iPhone Screen."
1,"Works great, save me many plugs. Been using it several months, taking it to trips and people were amazed on how many slots I had. No problem so far, and based on reviews I bought 2 ahead of time, and they are both still good."
1,Very nice
1,"I'm very pleased with this little subwoofer solution.  I needed something that would be compact and out of the way, plus I really just wanted a little bit of bass to round out my listening experience.  This seemed to be a really good fit for my criteria and the price was definitely right.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because the sound could be better.  The response could be a bit tighter, it's a little flubby or loose in the low end.  All things considered, though, I'm still very impressed with it.  It's plenty loud and it really brings out the punch in a kick drum, which is mainly what I wanted.  Just make sure you take some time to mess around with the settings (don't forget about the settings in your cd player!) to find the optimal sound for you.<br /><br />Also, I purchased the BOSS Audio KIT2 8 Gauge Amplifier Installation Kit which provided me with everything I needed (and more) to get my subwoofer set up.  Set up was easy enough that I was able to take some tools to work the day that it arrived and install it at the park.  I've been using this for over a month now and I would recommend this to someone who just wants a tasteful amount of sub-frequencies in a small foot print."
-1,Super cute but it broke way too easily. You get what you pay for
1,I am extremely pleased with the product!
1,"Fits perfectly, easy to install."
1,Lost my charger for the shuffle. This came in just 2 days and did the trick. You gotta love prime.
1,I purchased this battery replacement for my nephew as he is no longer able to charge his phone through a cable and relies on charging batteries outside of the phone and switching them out.<br />For the price and fact it's a Samsung battery it's a great deal. I haven't heard any complaints from him on it not working in a month.
1,"Decent case... I've had this a couple time... they last me 4-6 months.  There is a button on the top, and the opening for the button makes the case weak in that area... It eventually cracks and I have to replace the case.  I've bought cases from other manufacturers as well, and the problem seems to be more with the design of the phone than the case."
-1,This is not a fast charger like it states.  Very disappointed.
1,"So far, so good!  I installed this and tried it out a little over the weekend.  Very low noise from the bluetooth device plugged into one end, MUCH lower than any plug in adapters I've tried.  Plugged my phone into the other side and it seems to charge very fast.  I only took one star off because the power input wires are SO short, only about 4-5 inches!  This made for slightly tougher installation than I was expecting, as I was installing this in the dash."
1,"Great screen protector from a great company. Invisi Shell's customer service is one of the best I've encountered. The screen protector itself is very easy to apply--instructions and everything you need for a successful application is provided. One small flaw I would comment on is the cutting of the protector, as it is not perfect (no matter how much I've tried to align with the phone screen, there is a tiny part of my phone screen that still sticks out). But it rarely ever bothers me, because it's such a small difference. What I love the most about this Invisi Shell screen protector is that I don't even notice that it's there. The screen is so clear, and it is so responsive to the touch. Everything considered, I don't think I will ever be purchasing screen protectors from another company. Thank you, Invisi Shell!"
1,Second Magellan purchased works great.
1,Looks great on the phone and was a good price. Seems fairly protective. However I do believe that it adds a bit too much weight and bulk to the phone. I'm considering looking for another product.
0,"Seems too wide to slide in the side of my Samsung GT-N5110; otherwise, it works fine."
1,The best glass you can find. I can hardly tell that I got the glass on my phone.
-1,"Durability is bad. My screen spider webbed 2 days after having it. Do not remember ever hitting it on anything. So it was lightly tapped or had pressure on it. I contacted the seller. they said they would fix screen for 30$. While nice they offered to fix, 30$ every 2 days is not my cup of tea. But, while it did work, well after the bt notification setup with no instruction. Looked at youtube video. I did like the watch. Liked that my wrist vibrated and I could see who is calling. My phone does not come out of my pocket easy so I loved this. could respond to txt also. really liked it. I would use this and support it if it did not break so easy. BTW if it spider webs. you can no longer use it, touch screen does not work. had to take battery out to shut it off.<br />so my 2 stars is solely on durability, well and screen size was a little bulky. but that is a touch screen, could get used to that. I personally would like a smaller, not much, just a litter smaller screen, just to see who is calling, texting and such. thats just my preference"
1,works perfectly.
1,Nice product works great. It fits my phone perfectly and the color is just the way it looks. Love it!
1,"Really great case, i've already had a couple close calls and its saved my phone every time. The built in screen protector is responsive as well. The case looks great and does its job perfectly."
1,Great product.
1,Thinner than the original but so comfy and love the color exactly as it looks in picture. Nice soft silicone bought this color and two in green so far.
1,It's an otter box. It doesn't get better than this.
-1,Don't buy this item!  Had less than a week and the elastic pouch expansion has already ripped half way thru.  Don't waste your $$$$!!
0,"It works with my samsung, only thing is it falls if I do jumping jacks. I will only use for office, since i hate getting up and drop my phone! lol Why 3 stars? It falls off my ear, it's annoying."
1,Great
1,Works great. It charges my iPhone and iPad faster than the conventional wall charger does. Most of the time I just use this!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a portable charger!!
1,Used it hiking over the summer. No problem charging my phone and other items. Wish they had changed the placement of the grommets so that the pouch could be shielded from the sun by the 1st solar panel. Still gets 5 stars.
1,"This is a great idea for anyone that has multiple devices.  We travel quite a lot and it's very convenient carrying one charger.  However, this charger is slow and is best for overnight use.  Great value!"
1,"I like the way it feels in my hand, and the protection it gives my phone, it's what I need. Also I had a outterbox before this case and that thing was huge, but now that I have this case it's sleek and perfect"
-1,"Simple design works well and clips your phone quickly and easily. Despite what some have said, it does swivel to hold a phone vertically which is how I use it, so I can see more of the route ahead of me.<br /><br />Update: I liked the product functionality initially, but after 2 years, both units I ordered have failed...the first one failed in the first year and the other one in the second year. The plastic just breaks apart and the rotating portion separates from the base and it's useless."
1,"The card sleeves are a little bit tight. Can't fit much more than ID, CC and one or two more cards, but the whole point of the purchase for me was to slim down my wallet, so I'm not complaining. The magnet that secures the iphone case to the wallet portion is really strong and reliable (after two weeks of use). Overall, great value, and I would recommend it."
1,just a back up if i lose the original one
1,Receive in time states. Great to have and helps to organize
-1,I love bb! However I wasn't warned that the phone I was  purchasing had a glitch and  now won't even turn on
1,"I just got my Otterbox Commuter case for my iPhone 6+, and I'm very happy with it. The case is strong and sturdy, and I know my case is protected. One little thing I didn't like is the fact that I couldn't keep my tempered glass screen protector, and had to use the one they provided with it because the glass protector makes the phone thicker by a sliver, therefore making it hard to insert the phone in. This case does not have a installed screen protector like the Defender series but like I said they provide a screen protector that comes layers with two guide films to set it in place. I'm so glad I got this case because not only is thin unlike the Defender, but it's sturdy enough to protect the phone from bumps, drops, dust and scratches. I highly recommend this case, and I'm glad I ordered it. The seller is super fast in shipping the items, and the quality and workmanship of each product is epic. The cases are 100% genuine Otterbox, and they come in original retail packaging. This is really an amazing Otterbox case to enjoy and be proud of. Thank you. :-)"
1,A++++++
1,"This is the perfect case for my Galaxy S5.  I have had it for a few months and the case has not had any discoloration.  I like the fit and the sturdiness.  I have dropped my phone a few times, face down on hard surfaces.  So far, the case has protected my Galaxy.  I would purchase again."
1,Works great so far.
1,Nice Phone so far.
1,Love them!
1,"I grabbed these based on the price and some reviews. However, I had fairly low expectations based on past purchases of several brands of stylus.<br />What a great surprise- these styli are solid, a nice length, and write nicely. Despite being a little thinner than I expected, they have a decent heft.<br />They stylus end seems a little flimsy but works just fine. Personally, I prefer this design (stylus on one end, pen on the other) to the 'penpoint-through-the-stylus' style. All in all, a very satisfactory product and deal."
1,Lot's of positive compliments on the design.  The case is also sturdy enough to take a fall.
1,It was what it is as it describes
1,"Great introduction to VR. My wife and friends all loved it. There are many apps, but not quite enough content at the moment. For anyone looking for a cheap way to experience VR - you're in for a treat. Minus one star because you need to hold it."
1,"I purchased the MAXX Case from iThrough when my husband and I got new phones. Having previously had covers similar to this, I knew we would like them. We also knew we wanted a kickstand because we had one before & loved it. They are so convenient. The case fits very snugly which is GOOD because I had a case that didn't and eventually it would come off and I'd have to put it back on. I like my case. I had never had a white case before and probably won't get one again simply because it go dirty so quickly. I got the blue one for my husband and his doesn't look dirty at all. I solved the problem by simply taking it off and washing it. Since it is removable, that is fine. The second piece is the black part which is where the kickstand is located. They look to be just as durable as the ones we had before and they lasted longer than the phones.<br /><br />Although I am a product tester / reviewer and test several products each week, I purchased this case on my own without a discount. No matter which way I'm buying products, I always pre-test each item and give my honest & unbiased opinion."
1,As described and arrived earlier than it said. Great product .
1,excellent product!
1,nice product. i highly recommend this to others...
1,Love the length of the cords and works really well. I would defiantly suggest other people to buy this product.
1,Great price for this charger. Product was as advertised. Works well with my iphone. Fast shipping. I will recommend this charger to my iphone friends Thanks again!
1,"Great, even sold a few people on buying them.  The only problem was that after I got mine, there was a promotion for $12 off and I would have bought 5 more but it would only deduct the $12 once, so I settled for one (and to order 5X would have cost 5X the shipping."
1,Ordered this product as a replacement for the original which I lost.  Arrived a day early and I've been using it for a week.  Pink/purple color makes it very easy to find and differentiate from other power cords.  Works great so far.
1,Finally! Someone figured out how to make a true &#34;universal&#34; phone mount. This device uses a clever magnetic system that securely hold your phone in place regardless what kind of phone case you may have.  No double-sided sticky tape on anything like on other mounts.  Simply put they got it right!
1,It works.  Very simple to setup and to use.  Audio quality is excellent.
1,Awesome phone
1,"My wife and I both had Lumia 1020's, unfortunately a friend dropped hers and broke it. I gave her mine and bought this... to this day I still can't comprehend how it only cost me $40. It's obviously not a high end phone, but for the price... it absolutely cannot be beaten."
1,Interestingly too big for the phone selected for but he's happy with it. So all's well!
1,It's ok
1,Met expectations
0,"As others will mention, the fittings are backwards. Its fine if you replace all wires otherwise it'll reverse the polarity and sound terrible. I chose to cut and splice back together. A pain for a cheap product, but they worked just fine once swapped."
0,"Got these, they took quite a while to ship from China. Yes they actually ship directly from China. Out of 10 pieces only 5 will actually stay closed without tape. They are fairly flimsy and very likely will open if you just toss them into a camera bag. The price is cheap and while I'd prefer the type that actually ships with the cards these were the best I could find that weren't crazy priced.<br />Just be aware that they are not very secure and can pop open."
1,Arrived as expected.
-1,Broke on the first day i got it.. i needed it for a concert and i couldn't use it. Wanted to love it tho color was awesome
0,"Seemed more shoddily assembled than the OEM headphones which came with the phone.  Both sides are noticeably loose in the cabling causing lots of rustling noise while in-ear.  Sound quality is fine, just lots of rustling while moving."
1,excelent
1,"I bought this phone for my 11 year old daughter. It was an add on to my other qualifying purchases so it only cost $5. It's her first cell phone so I thought it would be a good learning experience for her to handle and maintain the cost of her minutes.<br /> She was really excited to receive it. It holds a charge all day and she plugs it in at night. It does the three most important things to her: Text, play music, and make calls. The camera isn't the best quality. After about 2 weeks of use she did say she had difficulty receiving texts from her friends-almost as if they are dropped but the sender (her) was not notified. She doesn't receive some pictures her friends send her but that is to be expected with 3G rather than 4G. After a few drops we've discovered it's pretty sturdy. We've since gotten a case for it.<br />  It's been a great learning tool for her. She monitors her minutes and uses some of her allowance to purchase minutes. For now, it's a great little phone for her and she's pretty happy to have it. I'll upgrade her when she's 13. :)"
1,I was looking for a protective case for my iPhone 6 for bike rides when it needed a little more protection against bumps than usual.  The phone fits perfectly in this case with its thin case (Belkin Grip Case / Cover for iPhone 6) still on.  It's also very easy to get in and out of the pouch.  Exactly what I wanted.
1,Works great
1,Very good protector for new 3ds xl
1,loved it
-1,Mine stopped working after 6 month
1,That is a great Android cellphone I ever seen. Great experience!
1,Purchased it for a friend and they loved it.
1,I bought this for my fiancé. She absolutely loved it. As soon as I showed her this little surprise she immediately put it on the phone:) great price btw. I'm super happy with the product.
1,Good unit foe my boat but distorts at high volume good at mid to upper volumes
1,"Durable, looks good, visible scratches on clear plastic back (Don't care though.)"
1,I love it. It protects my phone. Cool color
1,Great for a portable fish finder. Make sure you use the strap too tie off the excess cable. Mine got caught in the motor propeller. It only came loose one time. I used it on aluminum boats with up to 10 HP motors.
1,"I like it, my only gripe is the small opening for the headphone jack. Some of my headphones don't fit, any headphone connector larger than iphone oem headphones won't go all the way in the jack with this case on. It feels nice and looks good otherwise, its the best one  I found price wise."
1,"I have struggled with several different screen protectors from various companies designed to fit cell phones, camera screens, tablets, KIndle readers, etc. This was, far and away, the EASIEST screen to install. It practically installed itself. NO BUBBLES! I have almost ALWAYS ended up with bubbles trapped under the protector, no matter how careful I was. Due to the construction of this screen protector, the bubbles were automatically forced aside during installation. I have also had problems with protectors that dull the sensitivity of the touchpad interface. If anything, this seems to enhance that sensitivity. It certainly does not block it.  It did not interfere with my Spigen Tough Armor Case at all.  I would eagerly purchase this again, and again, and again. In fact, I think I will buy one for my wife's phone right now....."
1,This is my 3rd try to find a good case for my Galaxy S5 and it is has met my needs and expectations.  Wow!<br />I really like it.
1,"im surprised by the exceptional quality of this car charger. the included usb cable is also well made. top port is for standard charge. the bottom port provides a faster charge. small, sleek, and works well!"
0,would spend more and get a solid one. Not too happy
1,excellent quality products
1,great buy
1,Good case. Came early
1,Awesome product! Exactly what I wanted!
-1,"Had for 2 months, screen failed. Worked good up until now.  Just started repair process with Garmin, will keep you posted on how it goes."
1,"UPDATE: enviCAR reached out to me following my initial 1 Star review with genuine concern as to why I was unhappy. They have AMAZING customer support and honestly care about their product and keeping their customers and critics alike, happy. After returning the product and receiving a full refund, enviCAR followed up wanting to know more details as to why I was dissatisfied. As I mentioned in the my original review below, while the design and build quality are sound, they simply do not work with my vehicle. enviCAR generously offered a free mount (which they shipped to me VERY fast) in order to give as a gift to someone with a more favorable vent configuration. Well done enviCAR for truly earning my respect and this 4-Star review. Keep on keeping on.<br /><br />I have a 2013 Tucson and an iPhone 6 with no case for reference. Up front within reach of the driver there are two possible vents to use. When using the one to the left of the steering wheel, the phone sits awkwardly low and his partially obscured by the wheel. There is also no room to rotate the phone to landscape mode. When using the vent to the right of the wheel (which is rounded, not flat) the mount connects but is forced to tilt the face of the phone towards either the wheel or the passenger. The phone also blocks a portion of the ignition button and still does not have room to rotate to landscape mode. The construction and overall design of the mount is solid and packaged well, but it simply does not work with this vehicle. Also, with so few mounts up front, sacrificing a vent in cold weather months to avoid excess heat being applied to your device is not an option."
1,excellent charger
-1,The instructions are vague and there is no diagram naminng the various buttons purpose. I still am not sure how to switch between AM and PM.
1,Really good phone case.
1,Easy to apply screen protector
1,great colors; sturdy!
1,"Very good headphones for the price.  I use it for listening to music at work and video chat.  So far so good, I have no idea how long they will last!"
-1,Good!
1,"I love these! I bought two of these and loved them so much that I bought a third. They are super long, which is really handy. I have one plugged in behind a couch, and because the cord is so long, I can sit anywhere on the sectional and still have my phone plugged in and by my side. I also have one of these by my bed, so I can plug in my phone and hold it comfortably while it charges (instead of having to awkwardly lean over the side of the bed to avoid straining a shorter cord). My wife and I have had these for probably six months now and used them daily--they are still in excellent condition. I highly recommend these.<br /><br />Also, they charge our phones very quickly."
1,Awesome case..
-1,About 2.5 weeks the stand was broken. Cheap!
-1,"junk, never even worked"
1,"Nothing new in this watch, same as the other watches.."
1,I am pleased with my purchase
1,This product does its job well. It extends far enough to take the picture how you want it to and the pairing process was extremely simple. The thing I like the most is how portable it is. I would recommend getting this selfie stick if you need something that is quick and easy.
1,I love this case! The two piece cover fit perfectly and are super durable. Such cute colors and design. Will definitely order more cases from this company.
1,Works great with galaxy S5 even with my spigen neo hybrid case. The top flap cardboard separated at the velcro point but I glued it back together. Magnet on the side even works as a button/trigger. Only issue is that it's very uncomfortable after 5 minutes of use
-1,Not what I expected
1,Works great!! Definitely worth the money. It's not the loudest but it will do the job.
1,"You can see the quality and durabilty of this product. A good cable is always important too, it's not just about the charging usb outlet either."
-1,It doesn't protect enough of the phone.
1,"It's now the year 2015 and the iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard is still working as intended and in use since my purchase in 2007.  I am still able to connect to my iPhone 5, iPad 2 with the latest OS version."
1,Great adapter.
1,"I bought my Galaxy Fit refurbished from best buy and I love it so much. It does everything I want it to do and some. You've just got to realize it's not the other Samsung smart watch as in you can answer text but only certain phrases that YOU designate. It pauses, skips, and starts music."
1,great one i like it

-1,I couldnt get this to fit on my galaxy s6
1,I like the case.  Hopefully it will protect the phone like advertised.
-1,Do not get fooled; it's not working with Nokia Lumia ( Icon or 930 ) as advertized
1,"Works perfectly, original Samsung product."
1,"These are very slick headphones with a lot of verbal feedback for what you are doing at any given time including telling you about caller information if you use them to answer calls, power levels, etc. The instructions are actually pretty poor so it's best that you get this sort of feedback to help you navigate their use more effectively. For the record, the &#34;pairing&#34;/&#34;power&#34; button is the little button in the center with a phone receiver on it. This isn't made clear in the instructions. However, the phone functions are clearly explained.<br /><br />The sound quality is actually very good, though it does vary based on how they are put in your ears. The manual makes it clear that fit affects sound. If you get a good seal, the sound is excellent with good bass and treble. If they're not in properly, the sound will come across as more muted, though certainly not poor by any stretch of the imagination. The high notes are especially rich. Bass was good and not muted, but it may depend on your sound source and type of music. I listened to U2 and it sounded quite good, though the songs weren't especially bassy.<br /><br />The headphones design is slick and elegant and whether or not you like it will depend on how they happen to fit your ears. My ears are average for a woman and they fit me fine. In fact, I liked the fact that they are smooth plastic better than a rubber/silicon ear bud design, but there is no adjustment possible. If they don't fit you, you're out of luck. I wondered if the lack of alternate buds related to the fact that they are waterproof or maybe it is to ensure that people put them in such that the sound quality is good. I would recommend putting the cable behind your head rather than having it hang down in front of you because there is less &#34;pull&#34; on the buds out of your ears. That being said, I tried them both ways and in front didn't cause me any issues even when I shook my head to see if they would fall out.<br /><br />I didn't add up all of the time that I played music through these without recharging and I didn't listen for more than 7 hours continuously, but it didn't seem that recharging was necessary at frequent intervals. I'm sure they'll last long enough for most needs based on my rough estimation. They also seemed to have some noise cancelling effects, likely based on the position they take in your ears.<br /><br />Note: I received a sample of this product in exchange for my assessment.I played music through these without recharging and I didn't listen for more than 7 hours continuously, but it didn't seem that recharging was necessary at frequent intervals.

-1,"The case is snug and pushes the volume button all the way down, so I cant use the item :("
1,"Good charger for my iPhone!  It hasn't had any problems yet, and I have used it for about a week."
1,"Love this thing. It stays put! If in doubt, get this one. You won't be sorry."
1,Great case!  I love it.  I've dropped my phone several times and it's held up great.
1,The case looks exactly as the picture. It arrived on time. Is pretty and looks great.
1,"works as expected with Ipad and iphone. I do like the braided cable, since I have broken 3 of my previous cable due to intensive cabling...."
1,Great protection for my phone and really easy to clean. Seriously best phone case ever.
1,good for price
1,Love it . This usb matches my phone case. I am glad i ordered it. It works perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy 5 sport. Thank you will buy from again in near future.
1,Good..
1,Perfect!
1,Grey and blue colors are very stylish and chic.  It gives my Samsung Galaxy phone a sexy new makeover. Cover is very sturdy. Made with durable materials which protect my phone from falls and other elements.  Case arrived with a hand held mirror in the storage compartment. You can store a credit/debit card or even an ID with the mirror or remove the mirror and store 2 cards.<br /><br />I purchased this case when I travelled out of the country so I can store my card in an inconspicuous yet safe location. I would highly recommend this product!
1,"Installation was easy, with clear instructions, cleaning cloth and alcohol swabs provided with the screen.<br />My phone's original screen was prone to finger prints and smudges and was difficult to clean.<br />With this glass screen protector, no more smudges and easy to clean."
0,"Good product working fine. I ordered it thinking that I will change it myself, but when I saw the ribbon cable attaching the phone body to the cover my hands started shaking. Finally I took help from someone who had done this in past. Looking at the sweat on his forehead I felt its always good to know what you can do , but more important to know what you cannot, ;)  Revising review on 11 nov The battery stopped holding juice after around 6 hours of normal workday no videos or extensive screen usage . Time to move to new phone"
1,"Works great! Never had a problem of the suction mount loosening or coming loose, even in direct sunlight! Will hold an IPAD Air 2 but you will need to put it in a case or use foam to fill the empty space."
1,"I'm going to be as thorough as I can because I was extremely weary of third party bands at this price. I counted on reviews from people when searching, so I'd like to help anyone else out in the same sense. My band arrived on time with some other Amazon items, the band itself was inside a small plastic bag along with a screwdriver and the blue pin removal tool to take out links.<br /><br />The band looks great, feels great, and exceeds my expectations at this price point. I have a 42mm space gray Apple Watch Sport, this band makes my &#34;cheap&#34; Apple Watch look more up scale. When in actuality it was cheaper than an official Apple Watch Sport band.<br /><br />I put it on to judge how many links to remove and the adapters click into place as would be expected. I even shook it around a bit over the softness of my bed to make sure it wasn't going anywhere. I decided I needed to take out two maybe three links. I started with two and the first pin popped right out using the built in tool. The second didn't budge and the tool broke so easy it's kind of laughable. I ended up getting the pin pushed out with the pin part of a name tag, though it was a struggle. I got it reassembled and I'm pleased with it. I really actually need one more link taken out but with the tool broken I'm either going to have to see if a jeweler will do it or order a separate tool.<br /><br />Since most likely everyone is concerned with the band and not the tool, my rating reflects that. Overall I am very happy with the band itself, the only way I could be happier is if they would send me another tool to take out the one more link I need."
-1,Did not work with my 97' Buick. Not sure if it was due to my car or due to the fact that I got a jip piece. Pretty disappointed
1,I am now able to charge all devises in one location. Also like the fact that it sits flat on table with a cord to plug in.
1,Works as described. Very handy.
1,Excellent Apple Watch Stand and great value. The stand matches my 12 South stand for my iPhone  6+ and the look great together and keep stuff off the counter.
1,Good screen protector
1,My son loved it!
1,"This is such a nice cover, fits well and is secure to hold since has Matt finish.  Love the color, it's striking on the black phone!"
1,very good
1,great one i like it
1,Great product
-1,no instruction manual-radio ok
1,"This case it's fantastic and heavy duty. Very protective, I have dropped my phone many times with this on and my phone is perfectly fine."
1,"Nice looking case.  Snug, looks like good corner protection without too much bulk."
1,Very handy.  Keeps all your chargers at your fingertips!  Can charge multiple items at once!  Replay great.
1,excelente
-1,"It's a Minion case, but offers very little protection for an iPhone.<br />I'd skip this unless you're very careful with your iPhone."
1,I got this before a trip to Disneyland so that we could keep our phones charged durning the day. It has become one of my favorite accessories! It can charge my iPhone 6 several times before it needs recharged. I use it on the go and also just when here is not a outlet close by to plug into.
0,"The case worked fine, but I left it by itself in the car while I took the phone inside, and the plastic of the case warped in the south texas summer heat. Now unusable."
-1,"There is nothing to doubt amazon's shipment but the product can be better. The quality of the band is good but I cannot remove the link to fit my wrist. The original size of the band is too large for me  and I spent half an hour try to remove the link and I failed, I almost hurt myself, so don't buy this band unless your wrist is large or your wanna enjoy the process to fight with the link."
-1,Bought for my wife. Looks good for the first 24 hours then it started to shed. The damn beads are every where and it is peeling. The beads get stuck to your face your hands and everything else. This product is over priced nod it's really crappy!!!!!!
1,Cheap and sounds decent. My stock haed unit is okay but I need a 4 channel to really enjoy these. One surround had a dimple since the packaging facility at Rockford put all screws in little baggies and the bag got wedged under the surround and on top of the spider. Only cosmetic as the speaker works perfectly. Also found a home depot receipt in a box also. Lol buried treasure. Thanks seller for not including anthrax.
1,"These headphones has the latest bluetooth 4 technology and comfortable in ear design with interchangeable earbuds. Also these headphones works with iPhones, Android Smartphones, tablets, iPod touch, and other Bluetooth devices.<br /><br />The package includes a pair of headphones, a USB charging cable 6 ear buds.<br /><br />I was amazed that these headphones has a small button called multi-functional button. It also has a HD voice micro phone that you can talk through, and volume + and - button which you can use it to skip songs. There are more functions that you can't even imagine them."
1,Great product!  I'm using it now to write this review!
1,Works well. Just used it on trip from Chicago to Milwaukee to Green Bay and back - no problems!
1,Great case good quality
-1,"Work for a couple days, maybe a month if lucky then stops."
1,It's a nice phone case.  It's not bulky yet it provides ample protection for the phone.  Looks nice too.l
1,Good. I like the corner bumpers. Easy to hold. Good protection when dropped.
1,"As described and highly recommended... A little shy on the edges but I understand why. It fits fine with an Otter Box and probably would with any protective case which fully wraps the bezel. The product arrived with a holographic seal and I feel quite comfortable purchasing from iMacket who not only cares about customer service but offers an excellent customer experience. The glass installed flawlessly on my Note 4 without any bubbles or halo whatsoever. - Nice job! iMacket has obviously taken the steps to implement great quality control throughout design, materials, manufacturing and packaging... and I truly appreciate that. - Thank you!"
1,good value
-1,I liked it but bad quality. I used for 2 week and it broke so easily
1,Love this case! Looks good and does the job. Fits perfect and gives all around protection. I didn't think I would need/use the kickstand on the back but I end up using it all the time.
-1,"This worked great for 3 days. I took it with me to a tennis tournament where I knew my phone usage would be heavy. For the first 3 days, I was able to fully charge my galaxy s5 about 4 times. On the 4th day, I noticed that the device wasn't holding a charge and would only charge my phone for maybe a minute before it automatically shut off. If this worked like it did in the beginning, 5 stars for sure."
-1,Worked at first but then wouldn't charge my phone anymore. Not a good product at all. I'm very dissatisfied.
1,Good slim case. It works exactly as I expected. Provides small amount of protection without adding any bulk. No problems so far.
1,"Great product it's light and for my iPhone 6 perfectly. I recommend this for anyone looking for a light case, this won't weigh down your iPhone either, get one today!!"
1,My daughter loves this case for her new phone. She loves the hidden credit card and cash compartment!!
1,excellent
1,Good product.
1,"Looks great with a Apple watch, IPhone 6 plus, and a full sized iPad 4 with smart cover on.  Holds everything great, looks clean and organized, and the magnetic watch charger does a good job at holding the watch securely in place.  The wood has a really good look to it.  I'm impressed"
1,"Pretty sturdy case, I like the dust covers."
1,Very good piece of equipment. I use it every day while riding and have been very pleased.
1,Great phone case. Was delivered promptly
1,I have bought two other portable chargers to give my phone that little boost of power needed on long trips And this unit has easily done the job!
1,"Use it every day, totally great"
1,LOVE IT... It's everything I need.
0,the data was not so accurate
1,the glove really protects. I've dropped the phone like 4 times since I bought it and the phone is fine.  only problem is the button on the side for volume is hard to push.
1,Works well. Bettter quality than you find at the discount stores.
1,"Amazing customer service, I have the one for My iPhone 5s and now that i'm getting a 6s plus I couldn't not buy this! Looking forward to putting it on when i get it!"
-1,"Don't bother buying this! Left ear piece works, right ear piece does not!!"
1,good
1,The case is great. I would buy it again.
1,It works.
1,Nice but back clip broke after a few months.
1,Love it. Charges my phone quickly.
1,"The camera needs work; the zoom doesn't go that far. Other than that, I think it's a pretty good phone compared to my last one."
1,Work good.
1,"Great case, fits nice and feels high quality"
-1,"This watch did not match the expectations I had for a smart watch. The display looks not as clear as shown in the pic here. The rubber cover for the USB is of very poor quality. It can rip off after few months or weeks. When synched with my iPhone 5S, the watch freezes. Calls can be made through it. Quality of call is ok. Photos and Messages can't be accessed it requires another application to be installed."
1,Easy to use. Battery meter and a fast charger for all your devices. I got mine last week and plug it to my car port and right away got the measure of the battery so I can even use it while it's off. Of course better to use while your car is on.  Definitely a must to get!!!!
1,"I really can't think of how to express exactly how excited I was when I got this solar charger, but even so,"
1,very useful
1,"Best Case ever. All buttons and accessories (Headphones, Chargers) fit and work perfectly with the case on.  Slim design but not cheap. Has a nice smooth texture. Extremely light. Hand Strap fits well (does not include a hand strap but most any strap will fit on it. Extremely satisfied. Totally worth the deal. I would pay 25$ for it (base price). :):):) shrek approves too."
0,"It looks nice.  However, it was a little bulkier than I really was looking for, and there is no wiggle room for the closure if you have a lot of cards/cash in the slots."
1,Love it I use it everyday and it charges my phone to
1,Great sound quality
1,"Cute, functional and protects my phone well."
-1,Good but feels cheap. Also phone only stays in wallet by cheap magnet. The phone falls put easily
-1,Flimsy and gets dirty really quick. Like discolored
1,"I like it very much. It has room for an Ionizer (smoker) to get rid of bad smells, a 1A USB charger port for my new Bluetooth Sunglasses for listening to music from my iPhone and answering/calling, a 2A USB charger port for charging my iPad. Did not get a full score as I was unable to find a cigarette lighter that fitted without removing the outer part of the lighter and I have to hold it in to make it work/get power. Reason for missing start: It seems the metal sleeve in the charger is a bit too tight, but I have had trouble with a couple of other double-plug chargers as well, but it might be me that is unable to find one that fits and no problem with the dimension of the charger. If so, please correct me and it will get a full score. The adjustable angle will make it fit in just about all cars: A nice feature."
1,"Does not work to transmit audio from a TV (or other item that has an earphone jack) to my iPhone 6+.  The seller was very helpful and after trying several steps, and communicating several times, accepted the return.  The seller's concern for customer satisfaction is exceptional."
-1,Thought it was for the Vista
0,I did not like this case that much. The screen protecter became cloudy and allowed moisture under it.
1,"Great item, protects the phone well and doesn't hold oily residue like the plastic screen protectors."
1,"I bought this case for my wife's phone when we both upgraded our phones to the Edge+.<br />I had no trouble installing this case on her phone, other than it being a rather tight fit.<br />Once installed, it fit like a glove.  It has nice rubber sides contributing to a good sense of security the phone won't slip out of her hands.<br />The &#34;sparkles&#34; on the case are all recessed so it doesn't interfere with it laying flat.<br />My wife absolutely loves this case, and so do I, knowing her phone has a good degree of protection.<br />Great case, and highly recommended!"
-1,"I'm somewhat disappointed with this Bluetooth. I had one of these before and used it for years with no issues. I bought it at Walmart. This one however cuts out a lot for no apparent reason. When working correctly it's good but that's not often. If your looking for a small Bluetooth, I don't recommend this one."
-1,"Broke after using it for 2 days, not made very well at all. Very cheap."
1,Provides decent protection while keeping the phone slim.
1,"Great case, sturdy, and conservative looking!"
1,Just what I needed at a great price!
1,Works as advertised
1,Ever since i first tried these i have looked back since. They are slighty sponge-ish so when it takes hits itll mark it but never damage the screen. Just peel off and apply another. Fantastic covers.
1,Love it
0,"I love the case, it's super cute and protects my phone well. However, the sides becomes gray, dark, blueish, very easily when placed in pants pockets, etc. So now the edges are blackened, if I could clean it, it would be perfect."
1,Very good.  Thanks.
1,"This is a small form factor, well designed phone charger. I keep it in my work bag just in case my iPhone dies and I can't get to a power source. This is small enough to put in your pocket but, you will know it is there. It will juice up an iPhone 5 from 1% to 100% in about 30 mins or so and only once. But, that is exactly why you would want this. This is one full backup charge in a small package."
1,great
1,I gave it Four **** Stats because the Case is Great But if you have a Tempered glass protector the case pushes agents it and makes it bubble on the edges I have iloome Screen Mate Super Thin. But I LIKE the Diztronic Full Matte (Soft Touch) Get YOU One YOU Will Like It.
1,Everything on this order was fine. I got a great product at a great price. Well packaged and fast shipment.
1,Works well and a lot cheaper than the original Apple version.  Seems sturdier too.  But bear in mind it's a few inches shorter (36in vs 39in)
1,I love it!
1,"Was as described, shipping was very fast."
-1,"I purchased this case after having decent luck with the last redpepper case, I wanted a waterproof case for my Note 2 and vendors that meet this criteria are few and far between.  I wasn't pleased with the shipping time but was willing to give the product a shot since the first case was ok.  I received the package last week and within the first 48 hours the side button rubber was failing and the button had fallen out rendering the product not waterproof.  Then within another day the front button was failing and again rendered the phone case useless.  I would avoid buying if at all possible, at this point it appears there is zero quality control going on in China.  Unfortunately the big water proof case vendors do not make a product for this phone so it looks like I will be keeping it high and dry for now."
1,Very good product from Maxrock .Thanks
1,"Thanks, great"
0,"Telephone is awesome, but it broke after some days, it doesnt even charge now.."
1,Good product and easy to use
1,"I bought my daughter this phone case and she loves it! It is very cute and made well but it is a little heavy, other than that it is great!"
-1,they are not what i felt they were going to be do to the feedback on them the sound were just ok and plus by turning them all the way up they are not loud at all. i'm sorry i have to give them a 2 star.
1,works fine good shape
1,Good seller and product
1,Love it easy to use and the bamboo goes with my wood.  Delivery was quicker than expected.
1,2nd one purchased
1,it's really nice!
-1,Very small phone mount not sticky at all and no 3m tape either had to file claim to get refund. just a bad seller and product
1,Love this watch!!  I'm not a serious athlete (50 year old mother of 3) but I've run for years. So much fun to see maps and charts of your progress. Synchs very fast. Charges easily. Comfortable to wear. Lots of functionality.  My only criticism is that the programming is antiquated and difficult to understand.  It would be nice to have clear menu drops downs when you log into your Tom Tom account.
1,Does what it does
1,"From the moment I installed this product in my vehicle,  I fell in love! The Samsung Wireless Charging Vehicle Dock rocks! I have a Samsung Note 3 phone that has a wireless flip cover and I needed a Qi wireless charging dock for my car. The charger works every time I place my phone in the dock and I've had no problems at all.<br /><br />I love the fact that I can charge my phone easily and wirelessly. I also love the fact that the Qi Wireless Charger rapidly charges my phone. I've had others Qi wireless chargers that worked when they wanted to and charged very slowly.<br /><br />This is a high quality, very effective and nice looking product and I highly recommend it."
0,"The Samsung Galaxy Avant is okay I guess. I've only had it for a month, but the touch screen is laggy - oftentimes you have to press on a tab or icon more than twice to get it to do anything. Also, a tab will crash when surfing the Web. Don't ask me why. The phone looks and feels really cheap. Every time I press the home key button, it feels like it's about to come off and makes this annoying clicking sound. The battery life, as other reviewers have mentioned, sucks, especially when watching YouTube videos or listening to music. It drains really quickly. The sound quality of the receiver isn't that great, and the built-in speaker is so-so. But you get what you pay for, right?"
1,Tech Armor screen covers are outstanding.  Easy to install and no bubbles.  I would strongly suggest giving this product a try!!!
1,My oonly issue is where is the first package i ordered? Had to wait an extra 6 days and still im waiting on the case that goes with it. Package is cheap to say the least but its here and on my phone. And unlike other screen protectors this one is actually for my phone and not a universal one advertising as a direct fit.
1,Product does what it's supposed to do.  Easy to apply on phone and haven't had any issues yet. This was purchased for my fianc&eacute;es phone.  Compared to the one I have on my phone this is a little thinner but I also paid around 23$ for mine.  For the price it seems like a quality product.
1,Works very well and is as small as a deck of cards
-1,I ONLY GOT 2 1/2 MONTHS SERVICE FROM THIS PH IT'S SITTING DWN AT HOME NOT TURNING ON OR CHARGING WHAT CAN I DO? CAN I GET ANOTHER PH FR U GUYS?
1,It really works under water
0,"Easy to apply.  Cracked and dont know why ,wasn't dropped or anything.  Screen is ok so guess it worked"
1,"Great item so far. Shipping was faster (10 days from Etronixmart) than what was listed on the order (2 months) which was a nice bonus. The buttons on the GPD XD also feels nice, similar to a 3ds xl but with double analogs that feels really smooth like a ps vita as well. All in all great device."
1,Works great with my iPhone 6. Use it to link to computer for backup.
1,"I LOVE IT, ITS SOUNDS LOUDER THAN OTHERS HEADSET I HAVE, THEIIIIIRRRRRRRRR GREAT"
1,Matches perfectly with the set from my Infiniti DVD system. Worked great out of the box.
1,Nice!
1,Excellent.
1,Works just as I needed. Great adapter.
1,Excellent Thank You..
1,"I have had this product in my phone for about a week now. Like with any battery, you want to set it up for its lifetime by getting it a full solid charge before using it in your phone. With my original phone battery, within five hours of idle time in my pocket it was at 40% battery. This battery averages to stay around 85% idle time in my pocket within five hours. I am not a very heavy smart phone user on the average day, but when I do use it, I use it a lot. So far I can say that I am thoroughly impressed with the improvement of the battery life by purchasing this product. If things change within the near future I will update this review accordingly. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is having battery issues with their S5."
-1,"I bought 3 of these in July and let them sit in the packaging until August 31.  When I went to charge them, only one of the three charged.  I will not make this mistake again."
1,"Love this! I was looking for a well made and secure way of keeping my phone accessible while out on my bike. There are tons op options but this one caught my attention. It has the normal adjustable retention clamp that holds onto the phone just like every other product. But this one adds in another way of strapping it in as an added layer of security. The clamp itself has a strong hold and would do fine alone, however I love the peace of mind the extra layer of protection gives me. The straps are kind of a stretchy rubber that feel strong (no worries of breaking) and hold onto the corners of your phone. I have an iphone 6 and it fits great! I don't use a phone case or cover and it still holds strong. I've tested it on a samsung galaxy with case and it still fits fine. The swivel allows the phone to be turned and twisted however you choose and can be tightened so,it won't move. This is an awesome product and I would have this over any other!"
1,Love it! Just wish it would charge a little faster
-1,I have anger issues and i hate smart phones period. I get mad cause texting i can't tell what button im hitting so i throw my phone alot. Already been threw 4 screans. So this case pops off really easy and well yup screen #4 case didnt do s***.
1,"I like it so far, there are a few things I want to monitor regarding performance before I can say I'm actually having problems. It was a good price compared to retail and some Amazon ones. After all this time it still is working, but one of the ear buds cable stopped working properly."
-1,Doesn't fit the screen and wont stick to the contour of the actual screen
1,Just as expected
1,"It did the job while I used it. The only issue is that my house key falls out if I adjust it while running. Also, if I go for longer runs, I get a rash from the sweat salt grinding under it. I switched to a FlipBelt, but that is just my preference. Feels good to have my arm free of it. I guess it would be perfect for you if you were just going on a walk or some activity where you didn't sweat."
1,Tough case
1,Works very well.
1,It Was OK ...But Doesn't Cover THE WHole..Face Of Phone ...
-1,Did not fit the way we were expecting them to.
-1,When I just bought it I loved it because it's so difficult to find this specific color in cases.<br />However the case turned terrible after only THREE days of wearing it. The color started coming off and the rest turned very dirty and impossible to clean. DON'T BUY IT.
1,Nice product! As described & pictured.
1,"Haven't had a chance to try the product out yet, but visually, appears as expected."
-1,It does not attach correctly.. It looked nice but the case was loose and the plug wouldn't connect to the phone.
0,It will work.
-1,All but one cord has stopped working and takes hours for it to fully  charge my phone or tablet
-1,"It dont work good , coudnt see a movie or netflix or youtube."
1,"*This is an update to a previous review.  The Alaska Life has amazing customer service and will do what it takes to make sure you are taken care of as a consumer.  After reporting an issue with my product, they responded and got the product replaced immediately.  If you are stuck on making a purchase between a few different products, be assured that this choice comes with excellent service to support.  Can't go wrong.  Looking forward to the future products ahead."
1,We love this phone mount! It works perfectly clipped to the vent so we can easily detach it and use it in whatever car we're driving. It's strong and sturdy and flexible.
0,NOT REALLY SUPPORTABLE
1,I finally received my anker 10ft today.. excellent condition.. works very well ... overall I am please with my purchase.. Thank You!
1,"amazing fit, seems sturdy, plus you get a leather picture or card holder with purchase. it is not 3-d its just printed to look like that. Coolest phone case i have ever seen."
0,Great phone case. But no screen protector. Said it would have one.
1,"I do not like hard plastic or bulky covers. This cover is jelly soft, fits perfectly, does not detract from the look of the phone and does not add any additional weight or thickness to the phone."
0,The pen to draw on the back doesn't stay in the clasp and dangles around on the string..but I love how easy it is to write on the back and erase it
-1,The item was broken within couple of weeks after a small drop.
1,Good!
1,"iLLumishield for the Nokia 1520 is easy, easy, easy to put on. The first time ever that I've done the dry method without messing it up. It's beautifully clear and the surface is SO super smooth to the touch. I like this much better than Armorsuit that I had on my Lumia before it.<br /><br />The edges do not seal down completely due to the curve of the glass on my Lumia 1520, but with the protective cover on it hasn't been issue to deal with either.<br /><br />I thought I had something great before, but Illumishield is much better. So much better."
1,"I have had no issues with this watch, unless it searches for the satellite signal a little too long for my patience, but it never lets me down! Also love the app and how it syncs with my phone."
1,"Works well, but no instructions."
1,These are the best headphones I have ever owned!  I cant' rave enough about how lightweight and durable they are.  I did a lot of research and found that this was the best deal and offered the most comfort.  I had to have a noise cancelling wireless headphones for what I planned to use these for.  This product delivered way far above what was expected.  I would easily purchase another pair without hesitation.
-1,can't charge for more then 10sec's even with a 2 amp USB
0,Very good ..::;thank you
1,It was a gift.  They were happy with it
0,Didn't fit my Samsung tab 4 7 inch I had to trim it.
1,Worked perfectly in my 04 Corvette.
-1,the pressure of the water cracks it in like 7 ft of depth
1,"Works well.  The shipping is slow though.  Ship from China.  The material looks cheap, but didn't affect the functionality.  It works well."
1,Great!
1,"it came on time and it also came with an extra screen protector. I loved it, it looks cute and classy on your phone and actually it's cheap. I would absolutely purchase it again if I ever loose mine."
1,Works perfectly.
-1,"It has been almost a month since I started using them. At first they worked well, but now the sign that says &#34;this device is not compatible with your device comes up often&#34; and sometimes I have to move the wire around several times in order for it to start charging."
0,Very plain
1,"This wall charger works very well with android phones! However, if you have an iphone, you should consider another option."
1,great holder!
1,"This fits my iPhone 5 perfectly and the armband adjusts so that I can strap it at any position between my upper arm and my wrist.  I use my iPhone when flying, so with the addition of the optional strap extender I purchased (Amazon), this allows me to mount the armband to either my arm, or just above my knee when strapped around my leg (sitting position) while in my flying harness.  The key slot is a nice feature, but one I really don't plan on using.  For someone who uses it for running or at the gym, it does make a lot of sense.  Price was very reasonable compared to the other two brands I had purchased and eventually discarded because the phone either didn't fit, or they were a hassle to use."
0,Not good quality but good price
1,i really liked it<br />but on the second day it broke<br />but i could still fix it so its ok
1,just as described.  The band works well.  I would order another if needed1
1,It works just as quick as my wall QC 2.0 quick charger and OEM fast charger for my Note 4. I have to take a star off as it does not fit very well in my lighter socket. About 1/2&#34; of the shaft sticks out and doesn't always provide a constant charge. I have to be careful as dips and bumps can knock it out of contact with the lighter socket power. I've since rigged something up to keep it locked in place. It's not pretty but it works.
-1,One of the buds died a few days after buying the product
1,We absolutely love our new Garmin.  It was a replacement for an old Garmin.  We went for all the bells and whistles this time. The cool factor is the split screen when you approach a major freeway intersection and it shows you which lane to be in.<br /><br />We got the one with the case because it is a convenient way to store it when not in use.
1,"Nice item. Charging the phone is a little annoying, have to take plug out of bottom and the charger doesn't go in all the way."
1,"I really do like the Silicone rubber texture feel of these Wirelessky cables<br /><br />- 15 inch is a great size but compared to my 4 FT Galaxy S6 OEM Cable it’s a huge difference so make sure you know exactly what you want to do with it… Still great to plug in to USB Hubs or Portable power chargers<br /><br />- Seems to be easier and more flexible than some cables<br />- The Micro-USB end is smaller more slim than the OEM cable (as you can see from the pictures)<br />- But the USB End is just a hair bigger<br />- Great cable, that Should fit through almost any case, slim or not<br />- Seems durable but only time will tell how truly durable it is"
1,Easy to install and stays put pretty well. Hairline scratches are unavoidable thought.
1,"My favourite....<br /><br />2nd case ordered , it is protective and holds 4 cards and a IOttie metal square to hold on IOttie vent car clip.<br /><br />The 1st case was not bad,  It took allot of abuse from me and when I was at the beach it took a sand beaten..Could I have continued to use it sure, but it was time to get a fresh one..<br /><br />Note: I dropped my phone a few times and thought each time it is done in ...But each time it was good as new.. Edging was enough to keep out good<br /><br />For the money spent this is a great product"
1,I wish u sold these bulk.
-1,It's waterproof but the buttons don't work that enable you to take pictures.
1,Works great!
-1,"UPDATE 3/31/17: This phone turned out to be refurbished, not new.  Also became a total dud, cannot recommend it after all.  First of all, we found out it was a rooted device and no efforts to fix that could ever get the phone to update.  Then the touchscreen had issues.  Finally, after 18 months (and out of warranty, of course!), the phone simply stopped booting up one day.  It would only cycle the LG logo over and over.  I sent it to LG based on their instructions, who knew it was out of warranty but were supposed to let me know how much to fix it.  Instead, LG just sent it back to me with this note:  &#34;ESN Blocked. Aftermarket alteration to phone voids warranty. ESN and color of phone do not match. Refurbished unit or non LG label.&#34;  Total surprise to us as we thought we were purchasing a brand new LG phone based on the vendor's description.  We have replaced this with a Motorola G4 and hope to have better results all around.  Buyer beware!<br /><br />PRIOR REVIEW: This was purchased as a gift for my son's 14th birthday and for starting freshman year in high school. It was factory sealed, perfect condition.  We got him an otter case to protect from oopsies. He's very happy with the phone, especially loves the bigger screen, battery's long life, the quality camera. He's in marching band and his phone is his lifeline to keeping up with his schedule and communications with band friends.  We had to have the AT&T store fix the access point (we use GoPhone) to use the data plan, but now all is working fine. This phone will probably pass down to his brother or me down the road."
1,works welll!
0,"Overall good product, battery life seems to diminish after prolonged use."
1,"Very Good Quality, nice feel connectors.  Impressive cable!"
1,"[[VIDEOID:337a5584853242682937739abbe38f92]] I was sent this case by G-Hub UK for my honest opinion on this case.<br /><br />I am really impressed with this case, it's worth every penny.<br />It's really light weight, a great style with high quality production, the cut outs are great and the grip is second to none.<br />Great value for money, would definitely recommend it to all!<br /><br />Check out the video review on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPBFj113Tzo"
1,This is well made. Well designed and can charge either or both an iPad and iPhone. My guess is it has enough juice to charge an iPhone at least 3 times before needing a re-charge. Would I ever use the flashlight? Perhaps it would come in handy when traveling or when light is unavailable.
1,Love it.  Awesome.  Like the life time warranty it comes with
1,*NOTE*<br />some of these WILL fit the surface pro 3 kickstand to attach the hinge.<br /><br />Thanks!
1,"This armband is really comfortable, unlike my last one which was scratchy and made my arm sweat. The front plastic is thin enough that all of the touchscreen buttons work."
1,Everything you need to replace the ear speaker and headphone jack on a Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The repair was quick and easy. Thankful for this kit so that I didn't have to buy a new phone! It's well worth the $10!
1,Very good
1,This car charger seems to be very fast charging. I feel that it is much faster than my apple wall charger. I love how there are two ports incase my passengers would like to charge too. The white and grey is very stylish and I love the blue led which indicates it's charging. Very nice product!
1,Exactly what I needed!
1,Great tool added to our team.  Communication is a dream now and we do not have to use our employees personal cell phones.  GREAT TOOL!  Thank you.
-1,It was broken in the first week... It is not a good material
1,Works fine.
1,Great
1,Fits the phone and protects it well! My husband accidentally dropped it on cement and his phone was fine. The best cases available.
1,I love this wireless charger i use this one daily and never have any issues with it i bought several other wireless chargers and all broke within 6 months or less i have this one almost a year now and it is great it has three coils and finding the &#34;sweat spot&#34; is just a think of the past this one you can just drop your phone and keep it moving I find the blue light on the unit to nt be distracting when I sleep at all great for a night table.
1,This extra battery give me the extended life I needed for my LG G3 phone.
1,"I put this in my wife's car as a replacement for another kicker combo set-up. Could not find the same woofer must be out of production, now I see why! This is brand new and still being made, excellent dual sub-woofer. Makes my wife's system really kickher..."
1,"Sturdy, basic and subtle.  A great cell phone protector."
-1,Absolute trash.  This cable feels cheap and does NOT charge any faster than a normal $2 cable.  Don't believe the hype and save your hard earned money for something actually worth it.
-1,the plastic part of the screw breaks easily
1,Works great
1,Just what I needed
-1,"Cute phone case but cheaply made, it broke a few months after I bought it."
1,"LOVED IT,NEEDED A CORD"
1,I like the color and everything
1,"Works flawlessly.  Original battery had reach end of life, you would need to charge the phone once, sometimes twice during the day.  Now with this battery based on my usage i go all day and sometimes til the next morning before charging.  Also the NFC chip works just like the original.  Some other batteries on Amazon got bad ratings due to lack of the NFC function.  This battery is definitely worth it."
1,Excellent product that works exactly as advertised. I wish the cord was a bit longer as the AC receptacle in the car that I am currently driving is located in the center console away from the dashboard but it's only a minor quibble as it still stretches sufficiently for my needs. Product arrived much faster (12 days) than was estimated. This cord is much better than the stock cord that came with my 265W so I would highly recommend this product to any Garmin users stuck with a bad power cord as I was.
-1,"I spent the extra money on this glass screen, because I expected it to withstand scratches (as advertised). This evening I knelt down to tie my shoes and my phone slipped out of my breast pocket and skidding about 8 inches across the sidewalk (screen side down). As I said I was only kneeling, so the total distance the phone fell was no more than a few feet. I picked up the phone and was surprised (disappointed) to see a long scratch mark across the entire length of the screen. I tried polishing it with the included cleaning cloth, but to no avail - the scratch is permeant.<br /><br />Save your money and purchase a different screen protector - that way if it gets scratched you can just replace it without losing the bank."
-1,I used to give this a 5 star.  I had one and loved it.  Finally it cracked when I dropped my phone on cement.  It was still a 5 star item as my phone was not damaged.  I then bought 3 more of these.  2 for an iPhone 5S and 1 for a 6 plus.  I could NOT get a single one of them to install and besides my previous cracked version I have installed older non-glass protectors as well.  All 3 are ruined.  I went to The Anker website but the form they have for problems is long and complicated including pictures.  Multiply that by 3 and it's just not worth the time.  Hence the one star review now.  A 25% success rate is not good.  That's too bad because I did like the protector.  Now I am using the protector that came with my Otterbox and my daughter has a non glass protector on hers.
1,"I've had this for about 3 months.  The case itself is unobtrusive, and I've noticed no degradation to the phone's performance.  My phone dropped 3 feet out of our truck and onto a paved parking lot today.  It bounced around several times, and I was cringing with every bounce.  The case protected it 100%, with no cracks or scratches whatsoever.  The case saved my $500 phone, which is why I bought it, so giving it an enthusiastic 5 stars.  At first I thought I'd got what I expected with the screen protector.  It was all scratched and lifting at the edges.  Finally I decided to just take it off ... and ... MY BAD; there was a thin cover over the screen protector!  With that taken off, the screen protector performs just as well as the Zagg protectors I like to buy, maybe even better."
0,Nice case but it didn't fit the phone that we bought it for
1,Great product works fine
1,"Works great for overnight charging, as it doesn't charge as fast as a plug in connection."
0,"Great! Sound quality is really good for earbuds. Battery life is fairly long. My only issue is the odd shape of the buds, which make it hard to fit in my ear and stay there."
1,The original one they sent me did not work well. I had to resync every single time I got in the car. It was annoying but I lived with it. I left a review stating my dissapointed and to my surprise they contacted me and sent me a brand new model. The new model works completely different and ended up being EXACTLY what I was looking for. It syncs automatically when I get in my car after just 2 seconds. The sound quality is unbelievable. I could not be happier!
-1,This is a great idea. But. Using two cords at once they each do not hold the connection. Ok for one at a tie but that is not what I ordered it for.
-1,"The product looks great, but the case cracked just by removing the phone from the case. You need to remove from the case to charge with most of my cables and my dock. Not impressed"
1,"I actually really love this new way to combine my Wallet and IPhone 6+<br />I had a Metal Money Clip which I used and loved, but after 3 scratched credit cards I had to replace it, I threw in the towel.<br /><br />I like this one for a few reasons.  * The Pictures here are very accurate.  A tad heavier than a plain plastic case.<br /><br />1. Great Leather Feel, so much better a feel in my hand vs. plastic.<br />2. The Clip magnetically snaps. It doesn't move unless you move it. But cleanly is great for a stand to watch videos.<br />3. Good Tough Guy Look and feel. None of those clasps that Women uses for their purses.  This is simple and tough!<br />4. I keep three 20s in the lower part and my 2 credit cards and Drivers License in the top.<br /><br />My funny comment is after I put it in my Pocket, I for the first few days kept thinking 'Where is my Wallet'<br /><br />This keeps everything in One place, and for those like me who put their wallet in the bathroom, closet, kitchen, dining room and random places only to find you are now late for work... You get me.  IPhone 'Find my Phone' works in 1 minute, madly searching your house, pants etc... take forever and frustrating.<br /><br />Simple, Amazing Quality Leather, Slim and Cool.  I absolutely recommend this for anyone who doesn't have that<br /> &#34;George Castanza&#34; Mongo huge wallet.  And really do you ever need that 8&#34; of Wallet in your Pocket.<br /><br />Go Slim, the Ladies Love it!"
-1,"Junk. Threw it out within a day, never stayed put."
1,"Great screen protector! The fit is perfect, although it does take extra effort to align correctly with the phone &#34;Close All&#34; and &#34;Return&#34; icons at the bottom. It covers the entire screen perfectly. I did see some reviewer state that it did not. I don't know if there are variant versions of this screen protector; mine did cover the entire screen. This complete coverage can be a plus or a minus when using some phone cases. For example, there are no issues with the screen protector edges raising when using the Samsung Galaxy S6 Case, Rock Touch Series - Ultra Thin Premium Leather Flip Case. However, there are issues when using another case, such as the Galaxy S6 OBLIQ [Slim Metal] Thin Bumper Fit Armor Scratch Resist Metallic Finish Dual Layered Heavy Duty Hard Protection Hybrid. Most cases that ride on the topmost part of the chamfered edges may cause the screen protector to raise up."
-1,"The volume buttons are not properly placed for the LG 740 Volt phone. There is also no indentation between volume up, and volume down functions. The belt holder also blocks the volume down button, disallowing screenshot use. I would give it zero stars, since I can't use it with my phone."
1,Love it....
-1,Crap. Two of the 3 cords stopped working within two weeks of use. Only good thing I can say is they ship fast
-1,This is meant for running and obviously you sweat in it. This sweat seeps in and not a good thing for your phone
-1,Not dust proof. Not well made. Noticed plastic near buttons was giving way within a month. Ripped totally off in three months of typical use. Tons of dust gets behind and makes the see through back a terrible idea unless you like seeing the dirt smudged on your phone.
1,"Great product, high quality and a fantastic length; not frustratingly short and not comically long. Well worth the small fortune it cost to have this sent to NZ."
1,"Looks classy and great on my blue iPhone C, seems to be a very sturdy protective case, light up feature is awesome the front lights up as well. Lovee it my new favorite phone case!!!😀 and it also came very quick in the mail. Gotta love Amazon right !! Had all my friends amazed with the light up part and it's very sleek on the phone with good  buttons that are actually easier to press then the phone without the case."
-1,It works to charge iphone 6 but won't work with speaker dock with 30-pin... Disappointed.
1,The best purchase ever made online. I would definitely recommend the seller to others.
0,difficult due more to size then product -
1,Perfect fit and finish simplified a dreaded install
1,GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT
1,happy
1,Cool product
1,Great quality
-1,Didnt work when i got it...
1,Ok!
1,My favorite going-out case. Wish it didn't have the antenna hole. Very sharp and well-fitting. Love the coffee color combo.
1,Came quick and was exactly as posted
1,I love this watch and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for connectivity on the Android platform.  It is a little bigger than a regular watch but my regular watch doesn't show me emails and texts so it is definitely a fair trade-off.  I would buy this watch again.
0,Screen was really cheap and broke in a month with normal use
1,The cases arrived quickly and were exactly what I expected. Good colors and fit snug. Not a lot of protection if it drops but it's enough for me. I would buy this brand again for my next phone.
1,"These are the best earbuds I've ever used, and trying to use any others feels dull after using these for months. Their quality is great, volume is perfect, and are comfortable on the ears. That being said, the only inconvenience is that I haven't had mine for even a year and they've stopped working. However the price is cheap and quality great, so I will willingly purchase new ones every 6 months if I have to. I highly recommend these earbuds."
1,"I have very skinny arms, but I measured before I bought it. My arm is about 9&#34; around, so this did fit it (just barely). I like the open face of it and the strength of the silicone. It's not as bulky as other brands."
1,"Product looks great and was SUPER easy to put on. Love the big sticky screen cleaner to get all the dust off. If I have to get another screen, will definitely purchase the Poweradd screen protector again!"
-1,"Not sure if I got a defective one or not, but takes very long to charge and runs out very quick."
1,It was great. I love it!!
1,good case
1,"perfect fit, and heavy duty, great case for the note 5, pair it up with a glass shield and your phone is protected for everyday use."
-1,Think might be able to fit around my wrist. Good for someone with child sized arms.
1,"Worked great after I cracked the screen on my iPhone 4.  go to youtube for general instructions, proceed carefully and the rest was pretty easy."
1,This is a super thin case with lots of fun color choices!  Won't make your phone bulky and I've had it bounce off the parking lot more than once with no damage.
1,"Bought for my son after he saw I had another vendors model, he wanted to take it and I needed it for work when have long days on a call with support. This model charges his phone 4 times with juice left over, although he charges as soon as 1 bar is missing if around power.<br />Owned a couple months, so far it has held up, will update if fails prematurely, expect 3-5 years of use."
1,I have had the charger for three days and it works very well. Charges all my devices and is great for travel. Definitely worth the money. If anything changes I will update the post.
1,"Bought two of these maybe a month ago because all the other ones I had bought before them had fallen apart. Figured if I bought two I'd have a backup for when the next one breaks.  I am happy to report that now, one month later, it is still working! Who knows for how much longer though lol"
1,The iPhone 6 Armband comes in a little cardboard container. The whole thing is really thin; almost paper thin. There are two separate wraps for this product. One is for your arm which is big enough to fit any arm. The other is for headphones so they aren't dangling everywhere while jogging. My phone fits perfectly in the spot for it. There is a clear case so you can see your screen at all times. The armband is very comfortable to wear and does the job of protecting the phone and also allowing one to carry on with the tasks being done without worrying about the phone. It is sweat proof and also has a holder for keys and cards. I love this product it's light as a feather and fits me perfectly. I definitely recommend. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.
1,"I purchased one and liked it so much, I purchased another one for my husband as well :)"
1,Nice
1,"I would give this product 4 or maybe 5 stars, however; after about a month and 8-10 uses, the bluetooth won't pick any of my devices up any more! Sometimes, it starts out okay, but the signal gradually fades and then the signal is &quot;Out of Range&quot;. Again, I'd be very pleased with this product if it lasted, but it didn't.<br /><br />UPDATE - After reading my review, Patozon sent me a new pair of headphones for free. I only received them today, so I'll reserve judgment for the moment. Although I can't speak for the new set yet, I can speak for Patozon customer service. They didn't hassle me. They sent me one email, apologized, and informed me that they were sending a new set. Excellent customer service.<br /><br />UPDATE #2 - My new set of headphones has worked flawlessly, to date. I'm very happy with the purchase and would not hesitate to buy from Patozon in the future."
-1,The phone doesn't work properly in the case. It is too big and bulky so when you actually try to use your screen or even turn up the volume it wont allow you to.
1,Love it!
1,works just as advertised.
1,Great phone
1,As advertised<br />Recommend
1,These wireless earphones gives a great quality sound. All the music sound and the voice during call can be heard smoothly. The earbuds are soft and comforting. I don't have to adjust it in the ears again and again. t was provided to me as a free sample to test and I recommend it to everyone.
1,"MFI certified and braided.  Also comes with tech armor's awesome lifetime warranty.  No competition.  A braided wire can withstand 10x the punishment before there is damage and the data connection was flawless.  It does not feel nearly as flimsy as the OEM wire.  Plus since its backed by the lifetime warranty I wont ever need to buy a replacement cable.<br /><br />Personally, I highly recommend the 6ft version as you can always coil it up, however if you get the 2ft version and find that you need more length, you can't add to it.  I personally prefer the black cable as it does not appear to get as dirty."
1,Huge bulls fan it fits good ! I love it !!
1,I am pleased with my purchase of the Dynamics Wall Chargers. I need extra because I want to plug my phone into outlets in different parts of the house without having to move the charger around. These work just like the ones that come with my phone. They are made better than the ones found at local discount or drug stores. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
1,The product got delivered as described in the product description..
1,Love the case! The only thing is that other chargers besides the IPhone one doesn't fit and you have to remove case to charge it.
1,"Works well although not the highest voice quality when speaking.  Another nice thought would be for this to come attached to a phone holder since most people use one anyway. Then, you wouldn't have to stick it on the dash somewhere."
0,"Fits the cigarette lighter thingy just fine, but the actual rig is very heavy and I have to prop it up or it almost rips the whole face of my console off. Before I propped it up it would bounce and wobble which made it. Very difficult to use.<br />The clip to hold my phone (lg g4) baaaarely fits with the small case, will not work with wallet case. After a LOT of driving the clip portion came off the mount. It's a Ball joint system held on with a plastic nut, so just tightening it from time to time will solve that.<br />LOVE the charger ports, and the extra lighter port on the mount itself. However I had to buy a new charge cable, the one they send will &#34;harm my phone&#34; according to said phone. All in all I love having it, with a couple small modifications."
1,nice
1,Love this case and carrier. High quality and not big and bulky like some are.
1,"I've had this on my phone for a year, I rarely remove it. My phone is in like new condition because of this case, its the best case I've ever owned for any phone.<br /><br />If I had to choose a con, it would be that it makes a large phone slightly larger and boxier, but that wont matter when you realize your phone is in perfect condition every time you remove it."
1,Works great! Don't have to use a bunch of different wall outlets to charge a bunch of devices.
1,Works perfectly and arrived earlier than I expected. Highly recommend!
0,The case is absolutely adorable and I loved it but I had to replace it after about 3-4 months of use!  But hey if you don't remind replacing cases often it was definitely worth it for the designs offered!
-1,Charged my phone only a few times then stopped working.  I would not recommend it.
1,Great product. Delivered as stated  looks new.  I'm a heavy user and phone last all day and night with power to spare. I purchased<br />Purchased one for my wife and she gets 2 days out of a full charge
-1,didn't fit my phone at all. It said it fit my exact brand and model. It's huge and I don't have a glass cutter. I just tossed it
1,perfect fit
1,Product is accurately made and fits perfectly on the phone. Looks very nice and seems very durable.
0,Volume is too low and not adjustable
1,EXCELENTE
1,Great part and easy to install
0,"Upon receiving the product two of them were the correct size (for iPhone 6) but one came for the iPhone 5. The protector doesn't cover the entire bezel, just enough to cover the actual display. It's fairly straightforward to put on as long as you make sure to clean the display and make sure no dust gets in."
1,Pretty cool!
-1,"Love the look and the idea, but the hard casing that fits over the soft bumper part did not stay attached on one corner. It just kept popping out. I finally just broke down and bought an Otter Box."
1,My husband is very pleased with the cover.  Great product
1,I love this case.  It took me a long time to choose one but I love Speck and will keep buying their products.  I have used it for a couple of months now and dropped my phone here and there with no issues.
1,Better than I expected for the price. I feel my phone is protected and the rubber on all 4 corners is pretty thick.
1,"Between everyone in my house, we use a lot of headphones and seem to go through them pretty frequently because we were buying inexpensive ones. I had the opportunity to get these and so far they work great and feel they will last a while. I use them for online lectures for school, and I listen to them with a bunch of kids running around and I can honestly say they do a good job at canceling out the outside noise. It's not completely silent but it's definitely not distracting. The only thing I would have liked to see with these is extra ear buds (or whatever they're called). You get one size, so it's not easy for my kids to use because it doesn't fit in their ears very well.  Other than that, they are a good, quality set of headphones and are comfortable to wear. **i did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback."
1,"Great phone case/cover at an amazing price! It's durable and fits my phone/ports perfectly!<br />Honestly, it offers the same protection but with more durability than my last OtterBox case."
1,"Excellent, Just That I Need, Faster Charge"
1,For the rather unusual reason that a average consumer would purchase a &#34;fake&#34; IPhone is completely on you.  The phone looks and feels the same. As my iPhone 5s. Like many others I have a &#34;little thief&#34; that likes to take my phone. So now I just give them the fake phone and they're amused for hours. 10/10 would possibly recommend
1,"does everything it is supposed to.  Keeps the phone secure on my dashboard, in my line of sight so I don't have to take my eyes off the road when using navigation or navigating music."
1,Love it! Very easy to install and provides a great protection.<br />I recommend it.
1,I really like this case.  I bought it for my Samsung Galaxy Note 4.  My husband wanted the Otter Box Defender for his phone but I found that to be way to bulky for my needs.  This case meets my expectations.
1,Perfect for the upgrade.
-1,Rearview camera never worked. I actually purchased two one for me and one for my co worker. I waited to long to hook them up to get a refund. But now I got some cool license plate decor..<br /><br />PS my coworker's never worked either.. But for 12$ we didn't feel like asking for a refund.
1,Love it!  Word of recommendation; I recommend the phone battery case with the wireless receiver already install; for this to work great; I have the Galaxy S4 and just order my husband for his iPhone 6.
1,Works fine
1,"Works very well, let's see if it lasts."
1,I love it  bought a second one. May buy a third. Heavy duty.
1,This is a great product!  I love being able to solar charge the battery and use that power to charge my phone. The lights are great to understand the charging/charging function. It is a great compact size and feels extremely dourable. The two USB ports are great options and it charges my phone quickly. Wonderful way to being power with you on be go.
0,"5 for 99 cents!  They provide scratch protection but not crack protection. For the price, they are not but but they will need to be replaced once a month if you want a nice looking screen.  Spend a little more and get a nice glass one."
1,Works great for holding my Magellan GPS or my iPhone on the dashboard.
1,Product was and still is perfect comea in a couple days as informed all in all a perfect buy it charges my phone at least 4 times from 0% to 100 i have a galaxy
1,"Love this case, perfect fit, great material, great price! Exactly what I was looking for."
-1,Its not working properly. can't even charge 100% of my iphone6. n the small round switch is broken. so this is useless. i cant even use it anymore.
-1,not a good case for me
1,Slim case that shows the beauty of the iPhone but not slippery like other clear cases I previously owned and the ports are high enough for all types of lightning cables and all types of headphones and the speaker holes are exact
-1,Did not work at all!!!
1,I liked so much it's very cute and received on good time
1,I've only used it once but it's performing as expected!
1,Cheaply made but adequate for the price.
-1,...cheap stuff...if you put the metal piece inside the case and not glued on the outside it won't hold....specially on heavy duty cases...
1,"I mean, they are pretty cheaply made- you can tell that right away. However, the sound isn't bad and they get pretty loud. I've had them for about a week now and haven't had any noticeable trouble. I'm most likely going to return them at the first sign of any issue because there are more credible headphones at a similar price. But franky, for the price I paid, they're not as bad as everyone is saying."
1,This case has saved me from a shattered screen more times than I care to admit. I get lots of complements on the design too.
1,One month.......good so far.
1,nice unit  works well
-1,It's too heavy for kayak use.  It weighs 10 pounds.
-1,Did not fit my iPad ... Not even close! So disappointed!
1,Loved this case! Sturdy and very fashionable!
1,Love it! Its amazing. Its heavy and keeps phone super secure!
1,Works great!!
1,This little charger can be used so two devices can be charged at the same time. Very convenient for people always on the go.  Compact and actually works. Sleek design.
1,Has saved my phone several times. Usage for 2 years without issue.
1,AMAZING PRODUCT! FAST SHIPPING! THANK YOU!
1,Works as expected with a Toshiba tablet running Windows 8.1.
0,"Connects to Bluetooth pretty quickly. My only observation is, I hit the button and nothing happens. So I hit the button a few more times and it finally takes the picture. I'd give it a 80% performance rate."
1,Great for all us narcissistic Americans that think other people want to see pictures of us that we took ourselves at bad angles in poor lighting at events we think are cool. Mates fine and works. Technology is nuts!
1,Product is very good and satisfactory.<br /><br />This seller's items are always welcome.
1,"Great case for the money.  Being clumsy I've already dropped it a few times, but no damage done. Looks really nice on the Gold 6 Plus."
-1,Cheap product and not worth any star in the evaluation
-1,"DEVICE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE STYLUS, CLEARLY NOT AUTHENTIC BECAUSE OF THIS"
-1,It was not what I expected I thought it was the phone case but I was wrong
1,Received a replacement from the seller and it is working very well.
1,Works great. The smaller tip works much better for drawing.
1,"This is a well made selfie stick that feels solid in your hand, and it stays feeling solid when fully extended, supporting the weight of the phone without difficulty.<br /><br />To extend the stick, simply pull out as many sections as it takes to get the length you desire and give them a little twist to the left.  Fully extended the stick is about 3'.  To collapse the stick, give the sections a little twist to the right and push them down.<br /><br />Included in the package with the stick are the remote with battery, phone clamp to use with the stick or tripod, mirror you can attach to back of clamp, small tripod, stand for the  camera, and a GoPro adapter which in my case came without the thumb screw.  But that is not a problem for because I don't have a Go:Pro.<br /><br />To use the stick you screw the clamp onto the stick after deciding if you want your phone to  be horizontal or vertical.  The clamp is designed to give both options.  The photos can then be  taken using the Bluetooth remote.<br /><br />Although I have mixed feelings about remotes since it something that can be lost or forgotten, this is a nice one.  I like the fact that it has an on/off switch so that battery doesn/t get used up prematurely.  But if it does, no problem.  It is a common CR2032 and widely  available..  Amazon has pages and pages with buying options.<br /><br />The  small tripod is also nicely done.  Take the clamp from the tripod and screw it on the tripod, then take your photos with the remote.<br /><br />Finally, if you don't want to use the tripod, use the kick stand.<br /><br />With three options, selfie stick, tripod, kick stand, this is most complete selfie stick package I have seen, and everything is well made.<br /><br />A nice sleeve is also provided for storage.<br /><br />Sample provided at a reduced price for purpose of review."
-1,Did not fit my HTC 8xt phone  :[
1,I loved da watch although I wish i could surf the internet on it.
1,"Perfect for cutting through the clutter, finding your stuff and getting out the door fast. I found Tile through their crowd fund campaign and bought four in November 2014. I liked my first set of Tiles, and probably used them once a week (mostly to find my keys to get out of the house faster).<br /><br />When I saw that Tile was coming out with a new version that could ring my phone, I jumped fast. Since I've upgraded to the new Gen 2 Tiles, I literally use them everyday. Seriously, a huge game changer, couldn't be more stoked."
1,I could not have bought the perfect car mount for my Mazdaspeed Miata. My car is compact and has a smaller windshield than regular sedans. I was forced to forgo my rear view mirror attachment because it limited my view of the road- that's how small it is. I took a chance with this mount because I liked a reviewer's video showing how simply you could place your phone on to the mount without having to pry open a clamp; I really appreciate the one handed aspect of it.<br /><br />You can tighten the swivel head to be looser or tighter and the suction cup base is both suction cup and sticky to the touch.
1,I love the case already . Shipped faster then expected
1,Works great over my cracked screen
0,It's ok. It doesn't go around the screen as much as I'd like but it's working so far
-1,Has a hard time connecting with anything I try to connect to it.  I had to cut power to it and re-connect power to get it to reset/work at all.  Super frustrating.  Sending it back for refund
1,Love It!!
1,Works as promised. Amazing charger!
1,I love it
1,This case is fantastic!
1,Awesome for women with small arms!
1,"nice and small,"
-1,Okay
1,"I have had this case for a few months now and it still looks quite new.  In general, I am careful with my technology, but this case has survived a couple of falls (and successfully protected my phone).  The case is fairly thin, which I also appreciate since my phone spends most of its time in my pocket."
1,Great
-1,repeatedly turns on and off.
1,love it
1,"I have nine grandkids, ranging in ages from 1 to 10 yrs. I have anywhere from 3 to 5 visit for a sleep over at least once a month, plus other visits. I needed something charge all the tablets and phones...this is perfect. I have color-coded USB cables so every one knows who's is whose."
-1,my daughter had it 2 days and dropped her phone. the phone case broke. don't think it was worth the money
1,"Overall, this is a pretty good charger that does the job. If I could recommend an improvement would be to make the cord just a little bit longer.  Similar to other Amazon Basics-branded items I have purchased the components of this set are not the lower-quality replacement charging components we have all purchased at some time in our lives - it appears to be very durable, and I don't think I'm going to break off an end after pulling on the head to take it out of the cigarette adapter in the car.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good-quality and economical charger for your car I would recommend this one."
-1,"Phone case was ok, plastic is not very strong. The clip holder assembly was completely worthless, the phone would get stuck inside the holder and not come out. I will not buy this product."
1,Received package today. Thank you. Case fits securely and doesn't bulk up the phone.
1,great
-1,I was very dissappointed in this product it didn't work the directions couldn't really read it.
1,"Great buy and great price. Works just fine, almost no problems what so ever."
1,I like having the option of changing colors!
1,"Works great.<br /><br />Word to the wise, Amazon is full of &#34;genuine samsung&#34; batteries that are fakes.  Nobody is going to fake an Anker brand battery, so you are much better off with this.  It works at least as well, if not better, than the original battery when it was new.  Fits perfectly too."
1,Worked great
1,works well... does get a little weird if I have my phone in my right leg pocket and bluetooth in my left ear... I really like the fact it tells you when the battery is low! I have had some that just went dead without warning..
1,"This case is as good as they come for simple cases.<br /><br />I don't like bulky, otterbox type cases. This case fits PERFECT, the button covers do not hamper pressing them, and the case doesn't feel cheap at all. It even helps with grip, and keeps the phone slightly flat off the screen when placed face down.<br />Now keep in mind, it's more to protect from scratches and such, not so much dropping. If that's what you're looking for, don't hesitate.<br /><br />CG"
1,"Bought this case for my girlfriend so she could have a protective case without the cost of brand name cases. Upon arrival we opened it up and put it on immediately, the two piece design made it super simple to put on. All of the ports, and camera are not blocked in any way. The case also does not make it hard to push buttons, unlike other cases. After dropping her phone several times on hardwood flooring, it's held up very well to the abuse it has taken on. Of course the plastic was a bit slippery out of the box, but easy to get use to. Overall, we would and have recommended this product to our friends."
1,So far so good - love the heavy duty nature and old school feel of this cable....  update:  I bought a second one - I love this so much..... retro and cool.
0,"I love the extra room, but, the strap broke and the zipper is difficult."
-1,Cables suck. Doesn't charge iPad  air or iPhone 6plus.
-1,The mesh on the front part where the speaker is started to fall apart after the first day of using it. I just slowly unraveled day by day. I hoped that after a while it would stop but it never did. The buttons on the side are also impossibly hard. Eventually I returned it for a refund. I think there is a reason Otterbox discontinued this case.
1,Such a great deal! Awesome quality too.
1,Very classy!
1,Adjustable and comfortable. Once in a while it'll pinch my arm when I'm strapping it in. The key doesn't slip out which is great. The phone fits in the case and the opening holes match up for the iPhone ear phones quite well.
1,I used this device at extreme conditions (below 0ºC and above 4200m) for about a month and it performed extremely well. I really like this product!
1,Did exactly what it said it would. Note 4 charges under &#34;fast charging&#34;. Loved this product. Got it for $8 too with special code.
1,Just perfect .<br /><br />That is what I need .
1,"I like the holder / mount, it is small, flexible and  doesn't take up much space and looks nice over the dashboard of the car. the problem is that I'm afraid that for the long term the sticky gel pad will wear off or collect dust, the other problem is that it can only hold the phone horizontally which means that I have to keep my screen rotation option on which uses more battery on my phone."
1,This case is durable without being too bulky. Most of the ports are easy to get to except for your mute slider. It's not too hard for me because I'm a female with small fingers but for a guy or someone with larger hands I could see this being hard to get to.<br /><br />Otherwise I have zero complaints and really love this case! One of my favorites!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.
1,The Apple certified USB cords arrived on time and work very well.  I recommend this product.
-1,Short memory
1,"Actual JL grilles.  Works good as a protector for the sub, but it dents easily."
1,"Great product, but I have only used for 3 days since the first one came defective.  They replaced it right away for me by the way."
1,"shipping was fast. My daughter splashed my son with water and it was puddled up on top of the speaker, and it still works fine."
1,"Great product. I love that there is no adhesive. This means I can remove the protector, clean, then re-apply. No screen diffusion at all. The only con I could possibly have would be that it doesn't protect the entire screen (leaves the edges). Other than that, great product.  Side Note: Crazy fast shipping. Like literally ordered it Sat @ 4. Received Sunday @ 12. Crazy fast!! Thanks"
-1,It didn't fit the prevail as I bought it for my daughters boost mobile prevail.  She was soooo disappointed.
1,"This is my second one of this type.  I really like the window feature, although it does scratch easily, I will still purchase another.  Color is great too looks just as good in person."
1,Best cables I have ever seen or used. Both my phone and tablet charge faster.
1,Perfect fit and a lot of protection. Exactly what I was looking for!
-1,I purchased this in March and now it's 6 months later and it does not charge properly. I have used it 2x as I typically charge my phone in my car. I'm not sure if it was a good device from the seller from the beginning or if it was defective device.
0,"I ordered 2 of these hoping that my short battery life was just a result of an old battery (it's not, I think it's too many apps that automatically run). When I went to install both of the batteries, I noticed that the bottom base plate was on backwards. If you look at the bottom, you'll notice 2 protrusions, one on the left and one on the right. They aren't the same length though, one is longer than the other. Since there are the 4 contact points on the top where the battery actually connects with the phone, it's very easy to tell which direction the battery should be placed in the phone. But the bottom black base plate that comes on these batteries is attached in the wrong direction.<br /><br />It's a simple fix, but annoying nevertheless. Since they're just attached with some cheap glue, I pulled them off, reversed them, and pressed it together for a few seconds, hoping the glue would still be useful. The battery then went into the phone with no issues."
1,works so well
-1,This case Has no way to properly apply it to the phone without scratching it. I could t even use or return it to get my money back. Piece of crap.
1,"LOVE being able to charge my phone, find someplace random, and think about himself and his thoughts.  Please keep me informaed; I'll contribute in any way I can."
1,as expected
1,come on time and performs as promised
-1,Are not remove easily
-1,Was not impressed poor pitcher quality
1,"Excellent product. Works fantastic! Works fast. The only thing wrong with this power bank is that it does not come with an AC adapter. If it did, I would give this 5 stars."
1,"Love this amp...thought I damaged  it, ordered another only to find the amp protected itself.  Now I have two.  About to up grade so I can use both"
1,"Excellent for adding Sirius to our motorcycle! Love, love, love it. Worked perfect for what we needed."
1,"This was exactly what I wanted, fit perfectly on my phone, and came super fast!"
0,Grate
1,Great
0,Button stuck and I had an open microphone when I was talking.
0,work as expected BUT!!! it makes little noises while plugged in. Like an interference noise. It´s very annoying if it is near you when you sleep.
-1,it broker after 2 month
0,Got it for the husband.  He liked it but was not too impressed.
1,Love the stylus and the fact that tips are replaceable.  So glad I came across this product and highly recommend it.
1,10 cent piece of plastic. It does a good job but scratches easily. Really the military film shields are the way to go.
-1,"The product I Thought at first was petty good. It started with me getting a chip on the corner of the glass. I figured, I paid a premium for this just in case this happened.... Right?.... WRONG!. Contacted them via email. Was told to go through their website. Long story short, my Amazon order number was not recognized. Emailed again, was referred back to the website.... Same thing. Emailed again.... Nothing. 2 weeks later, still nothing. I contacted Amazon about this issue. Amazon gave me a full refund.... They stated they cannot make a merchant honor their warranties. If your outside of 30 days and your wanting your &#34;lifetime warranty&#34;. Good luck! 6% seem to get the same treatment. This should be illegal. Can't claim something to get the money, then totally ignore what YOU promised. Thank God for Amazon, otherwise I would have just been held up for 15 bucks! Plus the iAnder one works for privacy way better at shorter angles and a lot darker without having to darken the brightness on your screen."
-1,Didn't work out the box. Why take the chance?
1,Its nice but too big
-1,"Great small size. Good feel, a little slick, but enough grip.<br />However, the &#34;leather&#34; starts peeling away from the corners after just 1 week of normal use (in & out of pocket)"
1,"I originally purchased a different case for my new Galaxy S6 Edge+ but was not at all happy with it, and subsequently returned it.  Looked at this case and decided to give this a try.<br />The case arrived in 2 days.<br />Putting this case on the Edge+ phone is a bit tricky, due to it's snug fit...Especially with a Zagg screen protector on however, once I got the case on, it fit like a glove.  It's exactly what I was looking for with this phone.<br />It feels great in my hand, and the case doesn't interfere with the functionality of the Edge screen.  The rubberized texture gives just enough grip to give you a feeling of security that it won't slip out of your hands.  I purchased the red case.<br />This case looks stunning, and really contributes to the overall appearance of this great looking phone.<br />Fantastic case, highly recommended!"
1,"Within five months I was unable to charge the device because the charging port no longer works.  Update 23/09/15   So as of today, i've decided to change my initial review of this product from 2 stars to 4. This is owing to the stellar customer support & service i received from the guys at Anker. They did not hesitate to ship me out a replacement almost instantly and constantly kept in touch to ensure everything was working perfect with the product. I figured that a defective one somehow got away in the bunch, (given that all my other anker devices worked perfect) but they completely made up for it eventually. Gr8 Job!"
1,"Love the solid connection these make, stays solid in the phone. The issue I have had is that on the long cable the springs failed and now the cord doesn't stay in the phone well at all. The other 4 have not had that failure yet.<br />Owned for about 1 month prior to failure."
1,Works great and provides great protection!
1,these work great and have great sound.
-1,"This came in waaaaaaaay too late. Like about two to three months late, when it said something like a week to two weeks. It wasn't even worth the purchase, either."
0,"Pros:<br /><br />Charges Quickly<br />Holds Charge quite a while<br />Sounds Great<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Must have a strong Bluetooth Signal otherwise sound is quite choppy<br />Have to be in close proximity of the Bluetooth,"
1,this is a good product you should buy this product is awesome. it arrive early . i give 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
1,good material
1,"Fast Shipping / Good battery, very useful - Recommend it."
-1,Broke down within a few weeks of use. The product needs to be sturdier under everyday normal usage.
-1,"Don't buy! This worked well for a couple weeks, and now when I plug my phone in to charge, it won't charge. It says something like this accessory isn't supported. I'm so frustrated, and it's too late to return it now."
-1,"Wayyyyyy to expensive for a piece of plastic, rip off, found one for $1.50 at rc711. com."
-1,This product was ok at the beginning but I love changing cases but out of no where the back screen protector started cracking easily so I don't recommend it for ppl who drop there phones constantly because this product will NOT protect it it is cheese and doesn't last long
1,I think it's been a month already and this USB cable is still intact and working well. Seems like it's a really good quality charger.
0,"It's super cute, but kinda big and heavy to take it everywhere. It charges my phone one full charge, I don't know how many charges it is supposed to complete. I gave it 3 stars because is cute :)"
1,Very durable! Highly recommended.
0,"It protects pretty well, the top and bottom are still exposed but the sides are enclosed.<br /><br />The soft feel is great and makes the phone easier to keep in your hand, but it's also a problem with the light colored ones.  The first time I put it in my purse it picked up dark soil, and no amount of scrubbing would remove it.  That won't be a problem for a black one, but my pink one immediately became very dingy looking."
-1,This case blocked my phone from signal
1,It's just really hard to take off if I need too. I guess that's a good thing lol
1,Very happy with our portable power pack.  My husband has a classic car which he drives to different car shows so the power pack comes in handy when traveling.  I like that it lets us know when it is running low on charge also.
1,"Now I don't come across a lot of cases for the LG G4 phone but when I do I test them. This is a nicely made case and looks great on the phone. The case is actually 3 pieces, a top and middle layer and a hard plastic bottom layer. I feel that when you have multiple layers it actually provides more protection as they are able to absorb more of the shock. They also usually break apart but if nicely made like this case the pieces snap back together leaving your phone safe and the case easily put back together. I love cases that have a kickstand, after all these phones are becoming more and more for the younger age groups and they use phones to watch videos and play games. So if you are constantly dropping your phone or just want to play it safe make sure to pick this case from Joto up, for the price you can't go wrong.<br /><br />I did receive this phone cases from Joto at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review."
1,"Overall, I really like this case, it completely covers the phone. Although I have not dropped my phone, I am quite confident this case would do its job. The holster provides a tight, secure fit. The &#34;cons&#34; I have are less about the quality of the case, and more about user preferences. For me, the main downside is that this case does add width to the phone. If you have smaller hands, be aware that using the phone with this case often becomes a two-handed affair. The volume and power buttons are flush with the case, making them hard to find by feel alone. I've had this case for about a week and still struggle to find these buttons.<br /><br />As the pictures show, this case covers the charging and headphone ports. Since I use the charging port more than I use the headphone port, I do wonder how long that cover will last. After charging the phone, the port cover takes some time to return to the &#34;covered&#34; position (the port covers do not snap back into place, but the eventually return to a covered position).<br /><br />In short, this case will certainly protect your S6 and the included holster feels of solid quality. The cons I've mentioned might be user-specific, but thought they were worth pointing out. I thought about returning the case but I have not yet found something that is: thin, has a builtin screen cover, and a holster (only used-sporadically)."
1,"The second day I had it on, I already got compliments about it. People didn't know what kind of Applewatch I had, because it was rose gold. It is a nice rose gold, stays on really tight. It's still flexible so you can press both of the side buttons easily, but I do not fear it coming off of my watch."
-1,Not sticking properly to the mobile on cleaned mobile surface.
1,"I love this product!  I had the 1st version and passed it down to my wife.  Yes, the batteries last for a year!  For the new version, the addition of the back light, timer and strap lock make this the best fitness band on the market today.  For the price and features, I would recommend this over any other fitness band."
1,This phone has lasted me for over a year and has maintained it's speed and responsiveness.  It even got the lollipop upgrade after which everything worked perfect.<br /><br />The battery life is fantastic and hasn't gone down much over my year of ownership.<br /><br />Iv'e dropped it a number of times and it only got a couple minor scrapes and scratches.  The screen is still perfect and great for reading articles and responding to emails.
-1,"Within 2 hours of m review of the product, The retailer has contacted me (Via Text, phone, and email) to offer a return. Mind you, i ordered the product on march 27th and it is currently August 30th. I am amazed at this service. Sure i may not be happy with the product, but i am amazed by the dedication of the team behind this product.<br /><br />Here is my new more in depth review.<br />Audio: This device lacks in terms of audio quality. The headphones seem to focus more on highs and mids (which i prefer), but even then, the sound is distorted, as if listening to a small speaker which has been place in a cup.<br />Comfort: I understand that comfort can be subjective when dealing with in-ear equipment, but i find these to be incredibly uncomfortable. I have tried using different sized rubber on these things, but i can't seem to wear them for more than 15 minutes before i begin to have a headache. I believe this is due to the added weight of the earbuds (the battery and electronics are stored within the buds themselves, making them heavier than your average earbuds).<br />Form factor: The headset seems to stick out a little bit giving the weight a little more leverage to pull them out. This could be fixed by shortening the length of the earpiece by a few fractions of a centimeter or moving the center of gravity closer to the ear.<br />Battery life: I found that this device has amazing battery life for the size of the product, and it seems to hold a charge in standby mode. I haven't used this device for over two months, yet i was able to turn it on.<br />Cable length: Cable length is just about right, not too little where they can't hang comfortably, but not so much that they get caught on everything while being used.<br />Buttons: The volume buttons are placed perfectly. they are very easy to reach, and give a satisfying click when pressed.<br /><br />All in all, the GS-08's underperformed where it counted for me. I have since moved on to a pair of LG tones which i have found to be much more comfortable. Even though i may not like/use the GLYCON GS-08's, i would gladly purchase another product from them.gh i may not like/use the GLYCON GS-08's, i would gladly purchase another product from them."
-1,Color had more yellow undertones than the blues/teals pictured
1,Exactly what I was looking for. Prompt delivery and service. Intend to buy another for back up.
-1,"It worked for about an hour with my galaxy s5 and then it just stopped working, and has not worked since."
0,"Mine broke within a minute of removing it from the box. I put my note 4 in, but when I tried to take it out the cell phone holster seemed stretched to its maximum limits. I popped my phone out only to see the springs were stretched out completely, rendering the device useless. Piss poor product.   Update: the company was diligent about contacting me and insisted on giving me a new product or a refund. I took the refund, but they demonstrated that they truly care about their customers."
1,"Great bundle of cords to color code where and how they are used.  All of the cords I have tried so far work.  My biggest disappointment was that unlike the variety of colors shown in the picture, I received five yellow, three pink and two blue.  Not much variety."
1,For a quick burst of power for my phone it's hard to beat the price. It won't fully charge my phone but 45% will do in an emergency.
0,doesn't  look much like leather...
1,"Hea, this item is great, durable, and fits perfect , Never expected this great of item at such a low price"
-1,"Where's the mute button?  Why does it seem that these Bluetooth headsets are getting more expensive, yet loose features, and feel cheaper?"
-1,"I got this stylus and returned it on the same day. It doesn't work unless you really push it on your screen. I tried it on iPad 4, iPhone 5 & 5S, and iPod 4. Every time the same result. You have to push it very hard on the screen in order for the stylus to be active. Otherwise, it doesn't work. I don't recommend it."
1,This case is a great value for the money. It is very comfortable to hold The buttons fit very well. Overall extremely well-made and a nice addition for your iPhone.
1,Absolutely love this case exactly what I wanted and needed. The leather is perfect and I'm grateful for amazon's existence very cheap it would of cost a lot more in a store.
1,Cute
1,"Love the charger, works as described"
1,Fast shipping .. Good item
1,Love the looks and perfect fit.
1,Works as promised.
1,super
0,so far it's ok
1,"It arrived sooner than expected, it is good quality and I am very satisfied. Would order from them again."
-1,"doesn't really fits the screens I have, knowing that description said it does !!!"
1,"The case is koo love it, only problem (on my part) ordered the case for the wrong LG phone lol"
1,"This is a very nice charger for your phone and other tech toys. It isn't too large, and does a good job of recharging your phone. It can also be charged by using the port on your laptop. Extra security for traveling or at the university is always nice. These chargers are great!"
-1,"This phone is absolutely terrible! It states that it is designed for use with AT&T...<br /><br />Okay, well first off, it is set for using up to 2 SIM cards, but the IEMI numbers do not match watch actually comes through in their system (they chronically think that it's a NOKIA). Second, straight from the factor the internal settings (VPN, APN, etc.) are entirely incorrect, even after cycling through two different SIM cards from AT&T. The phone never achieved 4G status (see above) and AT&T could never track down a troubleshooting/diagnostics guide from the manufacturer - NOT SUPPORTED.<br /><br />Do NOT purchase this phone. The package insert is useless and there is no user's manual that covers any details other than how to screw the battery plate into place, how to insert a SIM card, and how to plug in your charging cord.<br /><br />By the way - the charging cord tip (the metal adaptor piece that inserts into your phone) is a custom job - it's longer (deeper) than any that you'll find in any store. This means that you cannot buy one anywhere for replacement. I had to buy one while on the road and was stuck using my pocket knife to whittle away some of the plastic so that it might reach in deep enough.<br /><br />Do NOT purchase this phone!"
-1,the talk button stick.....and it makes noise like griding sound
0,"Cute, cheap case. Had it on my phone for about 1-2 months. The paint on the sides of the phone started to wear off after that. But like I said, was cheap. Would buy again."
1,"I love this case!  High quality materials, very slim, looks great!  As good, if not better than Otterbox Symmetry.  If you can't guess by now, I highly recommend this case."
0,"Bought this for my brother who has a new LG android - while it looks fine, he didn't like it - I suspect that it was just not handy - not being able to get it out of his pocket quick enough.  He has opted for the slim plastic edged type."
1,"Great case! It is sturdy, yet very lightweight and thin. This case also comes in blue and red. Just wish i-Blason would come out with more girly colors, like a hot pink or violet."
-1,"The case is great, however, the shipping was way overpriced! I paid triple for shipping-more than the product itself...disappointing! Will not order again for the amount I ended up paying!"
1,Works as intended.
1,I am able to charge my phone with a full charge on the Anker. This is a handy piece to have around.
1,"I am very pleased with the Case. Its a quality construction and fits is a perfect fit on the phone, down to all buttons and plug-ins. Swivel and snap-ins on the belt clip holder appear durable. A very rugged yet professional look in full black. Again I am very happy."
1,Love this case! Perfect color and great quality for the price. I also like that it protects my screen and doesn't get stretched out!
1,Wonderful case!
1,"Fits on the vent of a 2003 nissan frontier fairly well. The best out of three that I had tried. Holds Droid Mini well although tends to depress the volume down button. I use this in other cars when needed, and it always fits in the vents."
1,"Decent case, very cheap.  Only downside is that the picture is misleading.  Lots of people poke fun at me because of it.  I don't care because I have a good come back and am usually clowning around anyhow.  The pic doesn't show that it has little nodes all over it.  The nodes keep the phone from touching the case.  When I say nodes...I'm talking LOTS of them and they are very apparent.  Usually someone tells me I have a girl phone case and I just tell them they are just jealous their phone case doesn't have nipples all over it.  Please see the pic."
1,Great product to put on the tablet to ensure it is protected and also has a nice stand on it so it can be propped up.
1,Its a great fit and it looks really nice!
1,Phone was in great condition. have not found any marks on it. Great purchase. I would purchase again.
1,"It hasn't passed the longevity test yet, but it works exactly as expected. I was able to power a counter-top oven with it (over 1200 watts) without issue. Well, other than the poor small car battery that was powering it started to dip in voltage after 20-30 seconds. When powering a 150 watt fan, I noticed the fan motor was louder with this than a standard AC outlet, which, I suppose is a product of the modified sine wave.<br /><br />EDIT (Sept 2016):  Still 5 stars! I've been able to power a fog machine (over 1000 watts) as well as an industrial cotton candy machine, which got very close to 1500 watts! This inverter never hesitated. Granted, the SUV battery powering it eventually cried uncle after 20-30 minutes (with idling). Keep in mind car alternators can't generate more than 400-600 watts worth of power at idle, so either use this with a larger battery bank, or for only short periods of time."
1,"This screen protector is very durable and easy to hold while placing on the screen. It is the exact size of the Samsung Note 5 screen from left/right edges so it takes a little long to fit it so it is covering the screen perfectly. This is a good thing because it gives room for your phone case. If there are any bubbles they are quickly removed when you use the provided cloth to smooth it out. Also, any particles that stick to the screen can be removed with the dust remover strips. If you take your time and make sure fans are not on, then installation won't be too hard. The screen may be thick but it does not take away from the quality of the screen. The stylis works just fine. It's not as smooth as it is on the phone's screen but there is no lag or issues while writing on the screen. All this said, I would recomend this product."
1,Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
1,All four wires are working
1,"Charges an IPhone 6 Plus wirelessly.  Easy to install into the Phone, I have mine on the outside of my case!  Does take slightly longer to charge than being plugged in."
1,Love it
1,Good product and on time delivery
1,Great case and price.  Arrived quickly.
1,Works perfectly! The AC power means I can run all 4 of my portable USB hard drives without a problem.
1,Fits great! feels nice and looks good! great buy for the price! Highly recommended!
1,"I originally bought an otter box case for my new phone at best buy,  but was disappointed by the bulky design.  Saw this one online for about a fourth of the price & I absolutely love it!  Nice rubber grip, sharp looking and kickstand is great! Plastic corners offer protection from drops. Thanks!"
1,aaa
-1,"ORIGINAL REVIEW: Great case- low profile and attractive, seems quality so far (I've had it for a month)  UPDATE: I dropped my phone onto the driveway and the screen was badly shattered, requiring an expensive repair. The repair shop told me that this case really does not protect the phone against damage when dropped. I would no longer recommend."
0,Fast but not 4g.
1,Love this case.  I like it because it helps by protecting the iPhone while also showing off it's cool look.  It also gives a little bit more of a grip so you can hold onto the phone better.  Not too much of a grip but just enough.  Definitely recommend it.  In fact I bought the same case for my work smart phone as well.
1,Fits perfectly and looks great. Only issue I have is the kickstand is hard to open.
1,I loved this case! Made the phone easier to hold and was just very pretty.
1,Offers good protection. Not waterproof but very sturdy and long-lasting.
1,better picture then OEM cameras in friends high end car
1,Love this cover super cute.. Only four stars because it's so bulky any fit it in my back pocket because of all the decorations. It is very pretty and they give you extra rhinestones!!
-1,"Obviously being Samsung original equipment, the fit is excellent. The front cover with the see-thru panel is nice. But that's where the good things end. Although this is an obvious flaw, you obviously can't take pictures or video by just flipping the front cover all the way around since there is no hole for the lens to protrude through. So the front cover just kind of swings awkwardly while you film. Second, it's Fingerprint City. I think most can tolerate this on the back, but with this cover, even the front panel gets covered with them in a matter of minutes. Kind of unsightly. But by far the most horrific problem is the fact that there is no latch magnetic or otherwise that keeps the front cover closed in place. Not only is this awkward and irritating when you are handling it, were it to fall, the cover would simply fly open on the way down, so it really provides very little protection other than maybe from getting scratched in your pocket. Cool concept, terrible execution. It's being returned immediately."
-1,"The protector is bigger and the corners have a different shape than the phone. This causes the screen never to adhere right. And because it is actually glass, you can't cut it.<br /><br />I got the usual seller email with &#34;we want you to be 100% satisfied, contact us if you have any issue&#34;, so I wrote then and explained the problem. Their answer was in line with &#34;pics or didn't happen&#34; because it seems that I'm too stupid to write a good explanation or a thief that lies to get $7 back...<br /><br />Just don't buy this..."
1,"This case has given me a nice sense of security. Adds minimal girth the the thin designed iPhone. But still gives the rugged protection to people who genuinely are careful as it is, but need that little peace of mind. The material used gives me that little bit of grip my dry hands needed. The socket covers for the headphones and charge port are awesome. Firm with a little something to plug the holes. I have I tempered glass screen guard on the phone already, but no need to remove. Touch works perfectly."
1,Love it !!
1,"Worked great at the Electric Forest Festival, came in very handy."
1,Case fit phone perfectly clips onto pants nicely
1,"After only a couple weeks after I purchased this phone, blue dots appeared on the camera, and I have no way of contacting the seller about it"
0,"BAD DURABILITY. WILL BREAK BEFORE 6 MONTHS, GUARANTEED."
0,"Started falling apart after 2 weeks, so had to glue it together."
1,Works Great
1,"Great case,very durable and the belt clip is a great feature..... Built in screen protector is good, could be better.....well worth the money"
1,Very well made - very happy with t his product!
1,EXCELENTE
1,"Purchased this case based upon a recommendation from a fellow realtor.  It makes life very handy to have everything at a touch of hand.  At first, talking on the phone was a bit awkward, it felt like I had my wallet on my ear - but soon I figured out the best was to wrap the strap around it so it wasn't dangling.  I get lots of compliments on it too!"
1,Prefect size and great. Received on time
0,Bought two of 5-packs 3 months ago. 8 out of 10 cables quit working after 2-3 weeks of use. The remaining 2 will likely break soon too. Returned both sets. Unhappy.  Upate 9/7/15: The company has reached out to me that they have located a defective batch of cables and are sending me an upgraded replacement at no charge.
0,X7 can only charge my iPhone 5 four times without a new charge
1,"This is the second of these cases I've ordered and it's perfect for my needs. The first one was for a Samsung Galaxy S3. I had it for 3 years and it performed just as I wanted. The phone and the new Note 5 that I just got, are very slippery and sometimes hard to pick up. I didn't want a bulky case. This case has grips on the edges that allow the Note to be picked up easily. The rest of the case keeps the phone from being so smooth and sliding off, or out of things, while protecting it. The first one I had, held up well, still flexible and didn't get all scratched up. I expect this one will as well. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it took a whole week to get it. I think I paid more than priority mail costs, for shipping and would have expected to get it a little sooner than I did. I was so afraid for the Note, until I got the case. Well worth the price.  Oh, and I love the color!"
1,Excellent product excellent delivery
1,Great product
1,"A really good Unlocked smart phone at a good price, I use un-limited Talk, Message and Data using Straight Talk's $45 a month card."
1,This is a very convenient way to hold your phone and get to where you need to go safely!
1,My old USB plug in overheated and warped plug in. Phone wouldn't even turn on. I thought my whole phone was dead since it wouldn't turn on. Installed this and was able to charge phone again and phone works great now! I also have no mic issues like some had. Install was fairly easy too. Thanks!
0,"it is what it is, buy it!"
1,"Good, simple TPU case.  Fits well."
-1,"I am not one to write bad reviews. Actually, I don't know if I have ever given 1 star, but this one needs it. I have had my S6 now for a total of 3 days now. It was placed in this case immediately, but this morning I dropped it from about 2-3 feet up onto the tile and my S6 has suffered a small crack and even worse, a blacked out screen. Now it unusable, not covered by warranty, and I will have to pay a hefty amount to use the insurance. This case is not as durable as stated. Shock absorption should have been way better. I would attach pictures, but I don't have a back up phone."
1,Terrific!
-1,The case is good but the outer plastic layer sucks after on drop the plastic broke from where the volume buttons are. Otherwise it's ok.
-1,"Piece of junk. Should have spent a bit more for a longer lasting, higher quality bluetooth kit."
0,it smudges
1,really protects your phone and comfortable
1,Worked perfectly.
1,Love how I can show the color of my phone and originality with this case simple and pretty.
1,"First of all i can say this product is really worth for the price . I saw people using selfie stick nowadays and i decided to buy one for me and searched here , Also some of my friends recommended to buy from here , Then i ordered selfie stick and really surprised to see the perfomence , I was really sick taking selfie with hand , Now this stick saved my time , Two features which i like is it must be foldable and easy to carry and the other thing its bluetooth portable and with a button to take selfie easily ,To be honest this product is 100 % worth of the price and also 100 % recommended from my side ."
1,nice product.
-1,used it for 3 days and protective layer started to come off and wires are starting to fray
-1,"This is a neat little thing, but it looks like the Android app is a joke. All of the features boasted about on the Misfit site are not available.<br /><br />There is no smart alarm available on the Android app.<br /><br />It's 2015. Android is the DOMINANT mobile operating system in the world. Apple is a distant second. It's long past time that it's ok or even tolerable to have an Android app that is not always as fully featured as the Android app.<br /><br />Overall this is a cool device. I wanted a sleep tracker and smart alarm. I didn't care about much else. It seems to work. I'd keep it if the smart alarm worked. Sadly, it doesn't."
1,"Can't beat for the price. Installed in my 2012 Kia Soul. Install went easy. Display is very clear, though small, but DVD's are very watchable. . Radio sensitivity not as good as stock radio, but still good. Once I figured the sequence, steering wheel controls installed. No extra adapter needed."
1,"I got the case fairly quickly, and I like it very much. In some other cases that I have ordered the colors are much less bright in person, but my case is perfect! It's rubber, not a hard case, which I prefer as it offers more protection for the phone. I've only had it for a week or so but I am very happy."
1,provides all around protection to iPhone 6 and a great price.
1,I got this case for my grandmas phone and she really liked it!
1,These batteries literally saved my phone from ever dying and now I take them both everywhere I go
-1,I followed instructions unfortunately the fil didn'd adhere to the screen as it was supposed to. I tried twice to no avail.  I will never use this seller because the product is substandard and is not worth the price paid.
1,"Very cute design, fits the phone well."
1,Excellent service & really worth the money.  This gadget delivered everything it promised
1,"This is a great little charger to have around when you're not near an outlet or in your car, where most of us have portable chargers ready to go. The housing is solid- it doesn't feel flimsy at all and has a nice weight to it. It's fairly compact, just about 4-5 inches high and 2 across. I was able to fully charge my Samsung Galaxy 6 from 15% in about 2 hours, which is great. I found that I cannot use it to charge my iPad, but I can't imagine what emergency I'd have where I needed to do that, so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />I'm not sure yet how long the pack itself will stay charged- that is something I plan to keep an eye on, and will update my review if I feel it requires charging too frequently. The only small drawback I truly have with this charger is that the sticky square mount on the back, meant to hold the charger in it's packing, was difficult to remove. It had nothing to do with the functionality of the charger itself, but it was annoying to deal with. Other than that, so far I'm very pleased.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
1,"Everything is almost perfect except space of charging point. When I use car charger, case needs to take off. It's not perfect for car charger."
-1,"The team arrived in Venezuela with all its accessories, but does not start and unfortunately there is no way to fix it."
1,Nice product at a nice price.
-1,"Incredibly thin and cheap feeling, the image is awesome but there is NO protection at all. Also let the package air out a few days, the fumes coming off these has got to be toxic."
1,Love it although because of the band people think I have an apple watch
1,"fast shipping , easy install"
1,"I can't say much because they're not installed in my car. nonetheless, they look really great and I've tested them using my home theater system. they sound great and I think I'll buy another subwoofer from them soon. the one thing that kind of disappointed me was that it did not come with speaker wires or wire clips. what you see is what you get. 9/10. would highly recommend for budget and decent sound quality.<br /><br />UPDATE: The speakers work beautifully in my 2012 VW GTI. I'm very impressed by the sound and quality of these subs. I also bought a pair of spacers to tag onto the speakers."
-1,"It fell apart, within a week. Lack of proper gluing. I am wondering if it was a &#34;knock-off&#34;, and not OME?"
1,"I tried this device on macbook pro, nexus 7, and windows tablet and they works fine. I currently use it mostly on windows tablet.<br />While on macbook pro, keyword works fine and the mouse pad seems a bit sluggish. I didn't try to adjust setting since my purpose was to try it out only. Other than that, this product works pretty good. One click or button to wake up the device. Once first recognized by computer, following connections are easy. Fist connect to windows device seems a bit harder but it can be windows issue because similar problem happened to other Bluetooth devices as well."
-1,front camera DOES NOT work. really really annoying considering i waited 2 weeks for it and i use my front camera more than anything. paid $75 for a malfunctioning screen i don't recommend. my boyfriend replaced the screen and it took multiple time of unhooking the connectors and reattaching them for them to finally work and for the lines to go away on the screen.
1,Ordered this for my son (16yo); he has had it now for several weeks.  Strong construction and durable to offer the protection a 16yo needs for a phone.  He says it is working great for him.
1,"This mini selfie stick is a great idea. I’ve seen a lot of selfie sticks and been able to test out a lot of them, but this one is just a great concept. First of all, it takes the selfie stick to a new level by making it smaller. Most selfie sticks are already compact, but this one can fold up until it’s just a bit larger than your mobile smart phone. Second, when it’s fully extended (it has a telescoping arm) it feels sturdier than some of the full sized selfie sticks. This particular mini selfie stick comes equipped with a corded remote. I rather prefer this kind to the Bluetooth connection because I feel like it’s more reliable. My iPhone 6 fit well in the phone clamp and I was never concerned about its security.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&#34;"
1,The BUDDIBOX case is sturdy and not bulky like the Otterbox.  Easy to add case to the phone for a snug fit.  Using the phone with case is comfortable and the buttons are raised offering much comfort. Accessing the charging ports and headphone jack is easy with the openings on the BUDDIBOX. The red color is bright enough to see when you lose your phone in your purse or on a messy desk.  I would recommend and/or purchase for a friend or myself again.
1,Awesome!
-1,Does not have a kickstand like advertised
-1,This device did not connect to my iPhone and also was very poor quality. I would not recommend purchasing this item.
1,"Good quality, works well.  I would have given 5 stars except it does not work if you have a case on your iPhone.  Small inconvenience for the savings vs buying a genuine Apple product.  Tip is slightly larger than necessary thus you can't plug into phone portal with case on phone."
1,"The U-shape selfie stick is compact, folds beautifully, and has a nice design.<br />Connection was flawless.<br />This guy will fit in a guy's jeans, your backpack, or purse. Say goodbye to an obnoxiously bulky selfie stick."
1,Give quick fair review and you can get best deal. happy happy.
-1,Impossible to apply
1,Just fits my phone great and cheaper than the Verizon store wants you to pay for the same thing.
1,Love it!! Most of these cases make it hard for me to hear and take awful pics!  Not with this one!
-1,"It's an okay phone.  It doesn't ring loud, I constantly miss calls. The availability of storage is crappy. Would only recommend for a 1st phone for a child."
1,I love this case. It is such a two-for
1,"This is a great case. It's sturdy and fits well around the phone.  These cases, it doesn't matter if you purchase it from Amazon or the apple store, does change colors. All clear cases do. I've had clear cases for years from different brands and they all do the same thing.  Highly recommend."
1,This case is so beautiful and stones are secured really good inside the case. Great package deal!
1,It was exactly what I wanted with fast delivery.
-1,"Hate this device now!  Was working well, but with the last two updates of the Garmin Connect app, I can no longer sync.  Tech support advised uninstall and reinstall, which didn't resolve the issue.  No further help available.  If it doesn't sync, what's the point?!?"
1,Cute!  May daughter loves it.
1,So far so good. Fast shipping .
-1,"I wanted the cologne so badly that I didn't see that this was after shave.  I was so disappointed  I did not want after shave.  I also didn't read the fine print that said I cldn't return this product. My husband will use it but he didn't need it, nor want it.  We want the cologne. My fault for not paying attention to detail."
1,Love it
1,"Great case! I bought a large waterproof case years ago that has served me well over the years for water parks, etc. This case however is perfect because it is small and specifically for phone. I have a Note 4 and yes, it fits easily even with my Ringke Fusion case on. Its a small case so I don't know if it would fit with an Otterbox but mine fits."
1,Nice little case that does not add a lot of bulk to the phone.  It makes it easy to spot which phone is which.  It also makes the phone easy to hold on to.
1,Fast  delivery A++++++++
-1,wrong color arrived from China and you only get 1/2 case. Misinformation.... not worth it !
-1,Product is okay.<br />Amazon.com service ¡VERY BAD!
1,"I do outrigger canoe paddling and SUP and I don't do a workout without it now!  I love how I can have so much information spread over 4 screens with each screen being able to be split into another 4 sections.  All the info I ever need while working out on the water on my own or with the team.  I haven't even reached its full potential yet, but love how simple it is to use right off the bat.  Keen to pair it up with a heart rate monitor and add that info to my workouts."
-1,"Was showing error when connected &#34;this accessory might not work with iPhone as it might not be certified&#34;. Bought two of the cables, one of them showed this error. Mine is iPhone 6."
1,Last for over a year
1,Saves the grandkids phones
1,very clear!
0,"The seller that I purchased from Seaside NY has been amazing to work with. Her customer service is top notch. She has done everything that she can to make sure I have working device in hand. I rate her *****FIVE STARS*****<br /><br />The OVERDRIVE PRO hot spot device, is just OKAY. It continues to overheat and it only gets 3G service in my area. I ordered this device as a replacement hot spot for my virgin mobile wifi account. As recommended by virgin mobile I upgraded to the Overdrive Pro device because I had had so many problems with my original device. The device seems to keep overheating, so Seaside sent me a brand new replacement device. It is up and running now, however the unit is getting hot. Virgin mobile customer service worked with me today to get our towers & speeds corrected plus they let me know that I have a 1yr warranty with them should I continue to have problems with the device."
-1,I think i received the wrong item ... it looks the same except the one i got does not have then sensitivity adjustments in fact there are no holes there at all  and one end had female RCA cables the other side had male cables  i thought this one had speaker wiring on one side and RC on other also  my subs sound like s*** ... they have decent bass and are 500w each but you cant really feel it in your chest  i am using this to hook up an amp to a stock head unit for my subs
-1,"I have my case for 5 months now, so I am able to truly share my thoughts.  When I first received it I loved it, it worked well, I did not mind the additional cable, but it was short and inconvenient.  It looked nice, and at first I did not mind the extra weight, but now I only use it for occasional use. The weight if too much for my pocket at work, the size of the phone itself is of course larger but the case just adds too much weight and additional size.  I find it does not charge my phone as well as it did when new. The case is also slick, and I would have prefer a backing with some texture or silicone to prevent sliding and slipping.  I can see this case would work better for a smaller phone even the iphone 6, just not the plus.  I you do not carry your phone in your uniform pocket, and have trouble recharging , then you may be please with this case. I have over time found it just not meet my needs."
-1,"This product advertises the free spring tool, which is one of the deciding factors to purchase this item rather than others similar. The tool was not included, very disappointed! The item itself is working just fine, but it was a pain to put on without the tool."
-1,"Worked exactly 6 months, then died."
-1,I am on my 3rd one - after about a month the first one quit holding a charge. I was sent another one - same thing a month in quit taking a charge.<br />I must say the company has been great about replacing it. I have had this one for a couple weeks now and just took it out of the box today. It is taking forever to charge. The suction cup was NOT in the box as stated. I am NOT pleased with the product at all.<br />When it does work - it's great for what I want - to pair it with my iphone and listen to the radio at work. But if this one does not work _ I want my money back - I can not keep wasting time on this.
1,I wish it could fit a slim phone case so I didn't have to take my phone out every time I use it. Other than that I have no complaint.
1,"The case has a nice look and fewl to it, the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars would have been a more non slip coating on the bottom which would prevent your phone from sliding on smooth surfaces."
1,"best quality, best service period.  order from them, you will be glad you did!"
-1,not working with my iPod Shuffle
1,"The case fits perfectly. I have no trouble using the lock and volume buttons or plugging in the lightning and audio cables. I like the silicone edging which should help absorb the shock of a fall/drop. There are sturdier cases available, but they look very industrial; this one shows off the phone while still offering some protection."
1,"Its very beautiful!  I have an unusually  slim area for a a license plate frame, I need a plate very very thin to get behind the back up camera on Toyota Camry (2014) and PA plates are big too, so double whammy, this fit beautifully!! Very happy with t he frames, you get 2, thats a deal, really!  If they tarnish or rust I will change my post.. so far, they are great!  Worth the wait!...well its been a few months and I have noticed some brownish looking, could be some tarnish, on a few rows of the crystals..

Wont buy again,dont recommend, sorry.. its all tarnished,I never go thru car washes,either, I wash my car by hand....very disappointed that its all tarnished...Update 04/02/16..HI, I have to say the seller is very attentive about trying to fix the disappointment I have had with my tarnished plates...they are very beautiful, but in a few months, mine did start to tarnish and now they are all tarnished with yellowish especially behind the crystals, but it is tarnished all over, the seller, will be sending me new ones and I will update again in the future, they are very good people to deal with and have bent over backwards for me, and I do appreciate that, hence the 4 stars....kudos to the seller..they do care.."
1,"Arrived fast and everything including the packaging looked brand new. Works well, immediately after plugging in my devices the phone began charging. I haven't had any issues with it, charges my phone to a full clip and I'm good to go."
1,Great price & great charger...
1,I have used it for months and it still looks great
1,"Bought this phone for my 17 year old daughter and she loves it so then I purchased one for me. I love the size, still getting used to it. I had a Nexus 4 before this, which my husband is now using which is a move up for him. Seems like a tiny lag when swiping the screen up while on Facebook but that may be because the screen protector is on it and I am not touching close enough. I love the phone but make sure you purchase the sd card so you have plenty of space for all the apps."
1,"Holds two cards really well. Will hold three if they don't have the numbers pushed out on them (ie they are completely flat).<br />I was a little worried how long it would last, as I open it at least once everyday. But it has held up for 5 months so far!<br />For the price it is totally worth it!"
-1,"This Shield is not as easy as they make it sound to apply, the solution that you spray on the shield makes it very slippery especially for apple watches due to the curve edges of the watch, my protector looked ugly and didn't stay on, it just kept slipping off my watch till i just peeled it off and threw it away ."
0,"First one died at 14 months, 2nd was defective,  Hope 3rd time the charm, does not come with holster."
1,Good quality and fits the Galaxy Express perfect. My son loves it.
-1,"I bought phone in Jan, problems started in April...broken by the 3rd month of owning.  I must restart the phone every time I want to charge it. Phone is not recognized by the BB link, The camera screen would blink green...<br />Issues are STILL not resolved.  Their customer care  resolution...to update software without plugging in and would lose my data.  Software has been updated and the phone STILL has the same problems<br /><br />I paid $600 bucks for this phone.  BlackBerry does not have a solution nor will they give me a new phone.<br />Their customer care is obviously out of the US since the only time they called me back was over 4th of July and didnt leave a message.  There for they determined the ticket was closed.<br /><br />Sadly, this issue is the very same problem they had years back...too bad BlackBerry hasn't changed their service at all.<br /><br />Disappointed...money wasted"
-1,It's great if you are a male with a big ear but otherwise if you are a woman &#34;beware&#34;<br />It hurts and ear is sore for awhile after taking it off.<br />I do like the way it informs you of incoming calls. It would be great if they made more sizes
1,A 'little' smaller than I though (although the dimensions were clearly posted). It's a well made case with a better zipper than I expected and a harder shell than I expected.
1,"Looks good, and I appreciate the ability to charge two tablets at the same time. My previous charger was also an iClever, a previous generation lower power one, and it's still running fine.<br />No complaints. Definitely recommended"
1,I love the convenience of this product. The sticky tape that holds it on is very strong and secure. It's made from a nice stretchy material that is tight enough to hold just one card but does expand a good bit. I'm bad about forgetting to use it but I'm sure as time passes it will get easier to remember it's there. It doesn't add a lot of bulk at all to my phone case. I even use it occasionally to hold a mini bic lighter and it has yet to stretch out. Nice product!<br />* I received this for free for my honest review and I do recommend it!
1,works very well and is a perfect dock for both watch and phone
1,came in handy
-1,"order wrong part, never got to use it. It was what was on the sight"
1,The battery life us good and it's incredibly fast
1,This is a great screen protector! I've gotten it for my parents and sisters phone. I still have the proginal one on that I bought almost a year ago. Only replacing it because they had to replace my phone.
1,I LOVE It Best Case for my LG G4  the Body Glove Black Slim & Flexible is non slip the grip is great and it Look's Good too I Love Body Glove Cases. Get one and you will Love it too.
-1,"it fit the phone fine, but it was too slippery. I felt I was going to drop it."
1,The case seems really sturdy.  I like that there's a separate clip you can attach and it can swivel but it is not easy to turn.  You have to work at it. Definitely a good buy.
0,The case is a really good fit for the Galaxy Note 4 but it doesn't cover the edge as much as I expected. Top and bottom edges of phone are fully exposed.
1,"This is a really great phone case. It really does protect it from accidental drops..which is something I definitely need!<br /><br />The design is also very nice. I love the vibrant pink color, and the slim design is very attractive.<br /><br />Note: I got this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
-1,Bad quality
1,Nice
1,This case is amazing and fits perfectly.
1,"Great screen cover. The only complaint I have is it doesn't go all the way to the edge of my phones screen. I don't know if it's smaller to fit phone cases. I have the otter box on my phone and there's still a pretty good gab between my screen protector and case protector, so there's quit a bit of dirt that collects on the edges."
-1,"Purchased this to replace old AM/FM radio.  The Mfine AM tuner is worse than my current one, which is why I needed a new one in the first place.  Went to all locations in the house, upstairs and downstairs, would get static when dialed into a station.  Must be getting electric feedback from other devices in the house.  Returned the product and get a full refund.  On the lookout for another AM/FM radio to try, will try one with an analog tuner to see if any better than this one."
-1,It's was terrible didn't even drop my phone before screen cracked
1,Bulky but that is what you expect if you want the phone to be perfectly safe. No problems at all writing emails with the plastic cover. Nicely done by OtterBox.
1,"Charges fast from the orange port for my Z3c.<br /><br />I bought it to use the top port to charge my GF's iphone, but I'm not sure if it's too much current.  I emailed the manufacturer and haven't heard a reply yet."
-1,Frayed at the iPhone connection end in 3 weeks of nightly use. Pass on this one.
1,"Love the soft &quot;ballerina pink&quot; leather band. Not of the best quality leather, but for the price, it's well worth it.  When the thing breaks, I'll be sure to get another. I had no problem what so ever switching out the bands.  38mm Sport  Small band"
1,"I've had many screen protectors over the years. The is the best I've ever had on a phone. It feels like the screen of the iPhone, it is super sensitive, it makes the screen look spectacular! It was super easy to attach to the screen with out one air bubble. Look no further than this one."
1,Great quality and reminds me of Tiffany &co
0,The package came under another brand's name why?
1,I am truly satisfied with my new iPhone case
1,order these for middle schooler. he needed them for school. They are very nice and expensive looking and worked perfectly. I am ordering a second pair for home use when he is using his laptop and iPad
1,Work greats. Charge my phone quickly. Highly recommended!
1,"Charges just as it says it does, very nice that it recognizes what device needs what.  Took this camping, little long on recharge in the fifth wheel with a generator..3"
-1,Very cheap and falls apart easily
1,EXCELENTE
1,It was a gift.  So hopefully it worked what it was intended to do.
0,looks just like picture . fast shipping ! The radio is very light in weight . hope it works good.
1,"It's exactly what I need: Durable, sleek, and awesome to look at!"
-1,Does not stay in place firmly. Bolts/Screws loosen up after time (I've had it for about one month now)
1,"These are Excellent Wireless Bluetooth in Ear Headset! They lay comfortably around my neck. The rubberish material easily conforms to anyone's neck and shoulder size. They are extremely lightweight. I love the magnetic pieces that hold the ear buds so when they're not in your ear they automatically go back to &#34;their home&#34; securely. The controls are incredibly user friendly. All the buttons are easily accessible and clearly marked. This set is by far the easiest set I have ever used to pair. You don't have to hold down a button or series of buttons for a certain amount to pair like my previous ones which I love! The sound is extremely clear and consistent whether im listening to music, taking a call, or watching tv on my tablet. They have a decent reach roughly 2 to 3 rooms away from the device they are paired to. The battery life is very good. They charge fast and last even longer. Overall I love them I wish they reached further but all the other features definitely make up for that. I also like that the charging port has a cover so dust and other elements are getting into the interior of the headset. I did recieve mine at a discounted price in order to offer my unbiased and honest review. I hope my personal experiences help you get the most out of yours. Happy Connecting!"
1,Works great
1,Perfect screen protectors. Fits perfect!
1,I bought a pair of these at Target for $100 as a gift for a friends birthday.  I liked them so much I bought my own pair.
0,wish i didn't have to take my back cover off of my phone to use this.
1,They were wot I expected
0,The bottom part doesn't stay shut anymore.
1,Really good. Have been using it for 4 months now and still looks brand new. Very convenient and very stylish. Go everywhere with just my phone now. Whether it's a party or school. Not one gem came off regardless of the rough using.
1,Case fits phone well and belt is secure.
1,It is so cute 😍
0,iPhone 6 plus doesn't like it and constantly says it isn't an approved charger.  Ipad 4 and Apple Watch work fine with it.
-1,Did not work 1st use keeps falling
1,very satisfied
1,"It was a gift for my niece, she likes it just not a big fan of the plastic feel."
1,These work very well. Nothing fancy. Just a dual USB charger that you can't go wrong with.
0,Was easy to install however the lens isn't as clear as the original lens was before it broke
1,NO problem so far. Works great
1,"Absolutely amazing value. I used to be a big fan of Klipsch, having owned two pairs of S4i and one pair of Ri6s and the Brainwavs Delta easily matches up in terms of sound quality even at half the price. The seal and noise isolation isn't quite as good, but is still very on point. The wire noise is minimal, the wire is light and not intrusive, and with the foam eartips that are included, these can be comfortably worn for hours. I love using these while I work out because they're so light. Furthermore, the one year hassle free warranty makes this hands down one of my favorite earbuds I've ever owned."
-1,Broke one week after I got it.
1,VERY NICE CASE FOR THE PRICE
1,Perfect case for the edge +. Very impressed with the construction
1,Works well.
1,They are super long. I love them and love the colors.
1,Perfect for keeping my cell phone charged
1,"This is an awesome GPS case, it fits my new Garmin GPS and charger with no issues, and protects it and gives me an easy place to store my GPS and charger during trips so it will not get lost, forgotten or stolen. I am sure this case is just as good as more expensive cases."
1,"Nice, sturdy and works like a charm. And it arrived before the estimated delivery date :)  Love it!"
1,Scared to buy at first since it said used but has been a decent buy. The front volume buttons have issues but I bought  the interface for my steering wheel controls from a local  car stereo shop and wireless remote for it that I ordered from Amazon as well.
1,"very nice unit ,much better than i thought it would be."
-1,Sounded great for about 3 weeks then broke!
1,just as explained
1,"Works great, and paired right up with my Note Edge. What more could you ask for? Not much.<br /><br />Please pay attention to the warnings about this thing not being for the larger phones, such as the Note Series. I originally owned a Galaxy S3, but had an opportunity to upgrade to a Note Edge before it arrived. The Note phones are too big for the spring-loaded holder. That's not this item's fault, so it's not right to deduct for it."
1,Great device. Works well.
1,"i received this product free for review and it works great. it is very easy to put on my phone. and easy to open, once i put it on my phone it was pretty easy to see there were no bubbles or anything . it works great and fits perfectly"
1,I love this case. It's perfect for carrying my iPhone and acts as a small purse! I definitely recommend.
1,"really good,"
0,"Nice, inexpensive watch band and dresses up the black Sport model. One of the pieces does not slide in and out as nicely as the Apple bands, but they do come out. Also, for the detail oriented, the part that slides into the watch is not quite flush with the watch body. Pretty much as advertised."
-1,"My cords all stopped working after the first +/- 2 months. They were great at first but now when I plug them in, my devices all say &#34;this accessory may not be supported&#34; and they won't charge."
-1,The outside border that holds the whole thing together broke down by the charging port after about 2 weeks.
1,Great idea at a great price!
1,It's really good gives a new nice look to my phone
1,Excellent
0,the slots for the watch band are covered by this making it very difficult to change bands or put back on
1,"Very slim, chic, all encompassing, protective case. The layering within the case truly aids to it's low impact when dropped. And, I love how the case is designed to amplify sound through the iPhone's speaker -- very nice touch. I've owned the case for roughly 2 weeks now and I am very pleased. The case also allows for a nice hand grip with little to no slippage."
1,"Arrived on time and undamaged.  It fit the bars fine and the rubber liners help the fit, and keep down vibration.  My Garmin Nuvi attached perfectly and does not move when underway.  For information, I ride an 18 yo Harley, so vibration was a concern.  Screen is easy to read while riding."
1,"Very pretty, fits iPhone 4 nicely, but if you are looking for a case to protect your phone, look elsewhere."
1,"I bought this so I could record quick make up tutorials of how I apply my lipstick etc, and it's perfect. Is so small fits on my vanity perfectly and is so sturdy. I love it so much. The little remote worked perfect and came with a battery already. So happy I ordered this"
1,Color a little more on the blue side than expected. Otherwise made fairly well.
0,"Charges iphone and ipad rather quickly. Capacity is insufficient to charge an ipad completely. Also, this thing takes forever to recharge itself! Like... 5 hours or so."
1,Easy to install & bubble free.
1,Great little amp
-1,Mic doesn't work at all can't make phone calls. If you referbish a phone you should make sure all of it works before you sell it
0,"This product works exactly as expected.  However, I have had several and they keep breaking.  I'm not sure why either.  They are pretty cheap and they break about every 3-6 months.  Since they are cheap, I haven't been sending them back yet."
1,This case is exactly what I wanted and good quality.
-1,Already blown after Two days!!!!
1,They sound pretty good and works well with my iPhone
0,"I love the size and dual ports. However, for being 2.4 amps per port, it seems to charge my phone rather slowly. I tried using an amperage app to measure what I'm pulling, but it doesn't recognize the charge. Odd..."
1,"Love it!! Exactly what it looks like! Beautiful case. It's easy to close. You wont be disappointed! The only downfall is, the shipping took awhile, BUT well worth it :)"
1,It came before the date it said & it was what I expected
1,"Excellent, no issues"
1,Very good
-1,The color changed to yellowish
1,"I love this phone case it's been weeks and it hasn't started fading at all. It came with a screan protector, the case, and a stylus pen. I was pleasently supprised since I thought it would only be the case! I get compliments every day with this case and I consider it an absolute nessity"
1,Great product at a great price.
0,Do not purchase these for the pen feature. They break easily (1 pen) or don't work to begin with (2 pens) so far.  Stylus is great!
1,Amazing
1,My friend loves this little gift.
1,"Fit my Note5 perfectly. Craftsmanship of case is on part with cases from Incipio, Belkin, and other name brand."
1,Exactly what I wanted/needed. Good quality. Everything fits and it looks great.
1,"Really hard to extend the stick, I am rewriting my review and giving 5stars because u were willing to make sure as a customer I am satisfied. And u can issue a refund. Thanks"
-1,The case had a defect. The bottom corner (touching the screen) would not sit flush against the phone. Case was way too bulky and very prone to dust.
1,Its a nice armband. Stitching is done well too.
-1,Didn't work. Waste of money. Threw it away! It gets one star because I couldn't post zero stars.
0,Nice case but hard to take off
1,I was very please the Motorola Battery for my cell phone. I would be happy to buy again.
1,It is very easy to use.  The locking of the extensions is great
1,"This product is great, but I was disappointed in the arrival time. Although it was only one day late, I wish I wasn't given such a specific date."
1,Very durable case
-1,All you hear is static does not come out clear
1,"So far, this product works great."
-1,"The car charger doesn't stay in the outlet and the wall charger seems to drain the battery, instead of charging the phone.  This cell phone bundle is crap and a waist of money.  I will not be ordering from ShockWize again."
1,It Fit Great
-1,Bad material!
1,Works!
1,Exactly as pictured ... Too long on shipping
1,It's a case. It protects my phone. It's not very clunky. I will continue to leave it on my phone until I no longer like it or I get a new one.
1,They send me a new one and work good!
-1,Lasted 2 months and the silicone busted. The plastic protectant case is ok but the red silicone busted quickly
1,"It's ok, I do Lyft & it does the job"
1,"Got this case for my hubby's ZTE Speed phone by Boostmobile and he loves the rugged look n its easy to hold, not slick like some cases. This has rubber grips , plus a stand for using on desktop."
1,perfect fit.
1,I love it! It is a beautiful case with the mint colored background and the roses of different shades of pink. The green leaves and the small white polka dots really pull the whole thing together. The fit is perfect and it seems well constructed. Very impressed!
-1,Was working great but then stopped working after latest apple update. Iphones have technology to detect whether products are Apple certified. These don't work anymore as they are not Apple certified.
1,"After having the newer large suction cup and having them fall off with temperature variations, and even damaging the interior as the detector drops, this mount is VERY secure. For best results though make sure your visor is one that is level with your roof line and hood. Otherwise you have to tilt the visor to align correctly. And yes it does fit the SOLO 2 and 3 models."
0,"It looks so nice,  fitted the back of the phone however i made it too sick"
1,Very fast shipping. Quality of the product is great. Would recommend this to someone who just wants a simple transmitter without all the fanciness
1,An absolute must for any driver!
1,"Wow, I did not expect a perfect phone in every way. Perfection to the detail. All the papers, sim card etc were included and I can not tell you how impressed I am with it.<br />Thanks soo much."
1,"Works great, exactly what I wanted."
1,"Installation was pretty easy as it just uses a long USB cable to connect to my F750. However, I mistakenly assumed that the camera's up orientation would follow the lettering of the label on the back of the camera. Once I had powered everything on and checked the camera view on my phone...I saw that it was upside down with no obvious way to change the orientation in software. I had to remove the camera, find some replacement 3M tape and reinstall with the correct orientation. The video quality is decent and my only complaint is that there are no orientation markings on the camera itself or in the minimal installation instructions."
-1,The opening tool broke only after a few uses. The pin that is used to hold the suction cup in fell out and the tool is no longer usable.
0,great
1,Poor battery life!!!!!
1,This powerbank is awesome. Lasts several days/ number of charges for my phone.
1,"I love this little cable! It's the perfect length, doesn't get tangled and unlike my previous ones, the wires haven't pulled out or frayed from the ends. I will definitely be buying a few more."
-1,Waste of money
1,I love it.  It was very easy to properly and securely apply it to my phone and sends to have improved the ease of use even.  It works great!  I am giving this honest and unbiased opinion in rewritten for having recurrences this product to try.
1,Fit good. Came with everything I needed to replace the screen
0,Plastic skretches up way too much
1,It works well ... I cut a hole in the back to allow my extended battery stick through. wish they would put scoring on the inside to mark where to cut for the extended battery. OH well the case works well in a difficult phone to make a case for.
1,So far so good.
1,"Perfect. Fits perfectly on the top of the phone and works great with iPhone 6 Case, Spigen® [AIR CUSHION] Bumper [Ultra Hybrid Series] [Crystal Clear] Air Cushion Technology Bumper Case with Clear Back Panel for iPhone 6 (2014) - Crystal Clear (SGP10954)"
1,"Not that same as the knobs that come with the original HDS7, but they work."
1,"Works OK, nothing outstanding or exciting about it..."
1,Good product
1,Great design and very sturdy!  Love the colors too!  The price is wonderful for five cables!
0,Armband not large enough!
-1,Not really a blue. More of a green. Not sure if I like it but we will give it a try.  Came on time. And seems to be very durible.
-1,The edges don't stick very well. All three of mine eventually peeled off no matter how clean your phone was.
-1,Ummmmm this does not charge my iPhone 6. Sad:( and sad I have to plug something into my iphone6... I just wanted to be able to place it and charge it.
1,"These headphones are definitely five stars in my book! It’s really hard to find a pair of good headphones that are a decent price that lasts more than a week, and these do not disappoint. I used these for a day then ended up giving them to my boyfriend because his other pair broke. He used them both in his phone and his tablet and he said the sound was amazing. Whether it was watching videos or playing music the sound was clear and loud! He used them to call me later that day he used them at work and we had no issues while talking on the phone! I also love the fact that it came with extra ear pieces. Once you lose those your screwed and they give you enough just in case! This is a great product and I would definitely recommend for anyone using headphones on a daily basis. They are also very comfortable in your ears, which makes a huge difference when buying headphones!  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
1,The power bank is a wonderful tool to have to charge on the go. I love that I can use the light to see in dark areas as well as being able to charge me and my daughter phones at the same time with the usb while eating out on the road. Love how fast it recharge itself and that it can go in my purse. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this product.
1,"Works great, certainly better than the 3rd party brand of previous one"
1,"Seidio did a great job with this case. It fits really snug with the form factor of the iPhone 6 Plus and doesn't leave any gaps for debris or foreign material to get in and scratch the phone. Moreover, the actual case itself is quite thin and sleek, while still offering great protection against scratches and drops. The kickstand on the back is a nice added touch, although it can be at times hard to pop out. When it is out, it feels strong and secure.<br /><br />The case itself is made of two pieces (top and bottom) that slides on and off the device. There is a locking mechanism though that works well - I've never had a problem with the two pieces separating.<br /><br />Overall, a protective case that is also stylish and fits well with the iPhone 6 Plus: 5 stars."
1,"I have used one since I got it,  it was easy to install."
1,AAA+++!!!
1,Its a good case. The rubber ends kinda bug when trying to speedily pocket the thing but all in all ok.
0,Will not work with Polk DB651 speakers
1,Works great
0,"This fell apart, kind of disappointed.  Because all of the card slots were super handy.  Wish there were a better design so, the backing held up better."
1,Meets all my expectations
-1,"It worked the few times I used it to power one device over the past several months, but when two USB cables were plugged in (only one connected to a phone), it smoked (that unique, burning smell of something electronic).  The description says it has fuse protection, but there is no simple way to open it to check the fuse."
1,Oh my God... this case is amazing!! It's so beautiful and Lana looks amazing and brilliant on it. Great quality and I definitely recommend buying this case!!!!
1,Easy to install and appears to work as expected.
1,I like it.... very happy with this purchase since the cost is 1/3 of the Canadian cost (Can$25.00 + 13% tax)
1,It works! Love it.
1,"These are just easy, cheap cables to charge my phone. Nothing fancy."
1,Just what I needed for my daughter whose phones' cables break down fast. And it's inexpensive in comparison with the original ones.
1,Good product
-1,"For the first week, it was working well but after the first week, it keeps disconnecting from the phone. It disconnects from my phone at most 10 minutes after I connect it. I am using it just as a watch. It's not as smart as it claims to be."
-1,"I bought this case for the novelty of the wooden material, but this thing just turned out horribly. It's bulky, it has bad grip, and it's very flimsy. The thing broke within two days of using it, after falling a measly 1.5 feet onto the floor, it shattered to pieces. What good is a case that can't even protect itself? Complete waste of money."
1,"We bought this both my and my husbands phones.  LOVE that if something is going to give... it's the invisibleShield glass that breaks and not my phone glass... And... on my Samsung, I've had to replace it twice now. It's not the mfg fault... I'm the one dropping my phone and it does protect the actual glass on the phone... just look forward to the day that neither break."
1,🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌!💃😘😘
1,Feature rich GPS what more is there to say?  Reliable and gets you where you need to go.
-1,"It was not working well for my hp pavilion touch screen... I tried to draw a line on the screen but instead of getting a continuous line, I always got dotted lines... I contact amazon for refund and I returned the product... 👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿"
-1,I bought this case and i have a verizon lg g2 and when i recieved the case it said non verizon carries only but did not say it anywhere in the description. I am super frustrated and would like a refund since that was not stated in the description.
1,"My favorite case for iPhone 6 Plus!  I've bought three!  There was nothing wrong with the first one - that phone just got stolen :(  So I bought two more for my new phone.<br /><br />The bumper on this case is the business!  Yes - it makes the phone a little less streamlined than some other cases, but I feel like the protection is awesome.  It also makes an already hard to handle phone a little easier to grab on to."
1,I have used this same product previously on other devices and I love it. I have had to replace once already on my s6 but that was because of a set of keys that scratched the protector and it was laying on them all day and I didn't realize it.<br />Application is
1,Good product but sometimes slips out of my air vents.
1,Great sheild for the nexus 6. Little hard to put on but they all are. Just be patient and take your time putting it on. Also feels much smoother than the regular glass which is kinda weird.
-1,It does not work well.... I can leave the phone on it all night and by morning its only charged to 85-90%.<br /><br />Plugging the phone in fully charges it in 2 hrs tops
1,"These ear buds can connect with two cellphones OR two tablets at the same time.  That's pretty cool.  Usually if one of my kids is using one of the blue tooth speakers I can't listen to it in my ear buds.  (Although it's the same music they are listening to, I like to listen with ear buds so I can tune out everything else.)  I tried these out over the weekend and they worked great.  I was able to listen to the music in my earbuds while my son had it playing softly for him to do homework.  I have not tried it with two cellphones yet but I am anxious to do so.  Charges fast and has good battery life.  They are also sweat proof.  I LOVE that feature!  I live in the south and the heat and humidity are miserable.  I have ruined a couple of pair of ear buds because of sweat.  My husband used these while mowing (and sweating profusely).  There was no problem with the sound, connection, controls, incoming calls, etc...  The sweat didn't affect them.  They sync up easily, the sound quality is great and they are comfortable to wear.  No complaints here.  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review."
1,Great product
1,I never write reviews but all anker products are the best!
1,Break pretty easily but you get more than enough to get the job done.
1,Ok
0,"If not for the fragile stand in the back of the case, this would be a 4-5 star item.  The sliding pins/posts are easily broken. I am currently using 3 of 4."
-1,Burned my hand after wire split days later.<br /> Used a few times and had to toss
-1,I did not buy this
1,Arrived faster then expected.  Works great while t the beach and while scuba diving and swimming
1,The sound quality is amazing and the price is very low compared to the quality!
1,Works well
1,Great cables.
1,AWESOME  only need LEDs to show solid connection for each port
1,ok
1,easy to hold and seems to protect the phone.  looks quite nice
1,It was so easy the replace came with tool and all
1,I love my Anker PowerCore mini.  I carry this in my purse or when I travel.  It holds it's charge for months and I use it when I travel and need to power up my phone.
1,works great.  going to take it on our 3 week vacation..
-1,It's a piece of trash!!! Battery lasted for about 2 weeks and then never worked again!! And the thing to put it on the wall never last... It falls every time
1,Congratulation for your team.
-1,"This unit changed the focus of the camera, the picture is not as sharp as the original lens cover."
1,"Excellent, great product and his quality has wonderfull"
-1,Belt clip broke after 3 days. Kick stand is useless won't support phone.
1,good
1,Works well with XMP3 portable player. Although the one pictured is not what they send. I actually like the one they sent me. It's a Delphi remote that's much smaller and thinner.
-1,Worst case in history of cases it brake when u put it in the spot beside the volume and and power cracked off if I could put zero I would
-1,"Music starts cutting out when I put my phone in my pocket. You would think with my phone only being 4 ft away from the earbuds, that this wouldn't be an issue. I will be returning them."
1,"For every phone I had, I would always get two additional batteries so I could always have charge when I went out. Each battery usually lasted around half a day.<br />When I got the Galaxy S5, suddenly my phone could last three whole day, and instead of getting more batteries, I thought I might as well just get one of these.<br />It was a great choice. I can charge my phone 5-6 times on one charge, or charge others' phones, too. I used it on a week long camping trip. If you have anything you can charge with a USB, it's nice for long trips, too! Depending on the charge, it can take up to a day to completely charge.<br />It won't over charge and keeps its own charge without wasting unnecessary power.<br />It looks nice and you can fit it nicely in a backpack. It's nice to take to events you don't know will have outlets, or if you just want to discretely charge your electronics.<br />I might even buy another in the future! Worth every cent."
1,This wallet phone case is very well made.  The phone easily snaps in.  I like the added protection of the cover when I put it in my purse or when it is just lying on the table.  Magnetic clasp is strong.  I also like how it folds to a stand.  It's perfect to use to entertain your toddler when you are at a restaurant or appointment!  I also like how you can close the cover and still talk on the phone.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
1,"Haven't dropped it in water yet, but did test it in the sink before putting my phone in it. The first time it had a small leak but realized I didn't have it all pushed together so tried it again and no leaks. Seems to work as advertised."
-1,Don't have options for languages
0,"Cable worked for a while, but does not connect to IPhone anymore.  Worked for a while, but not as good as apple products."
-1,Wrong item description...
-1,"Should prob go back to R&D with this one.  Seemingly ok at first. The top of the plastic which gets locked under the plastic clips can easily be pulled out at the corners.The waterproof seal for the bluetooth button is not water tight. needless to say, stuck my Iphone in this thing, and few minutes later it was in a plastic sealed bag half filled with water. Had that &#34;I told you so&#34; feeling loosing the vacation pics. Just get a dedicated camera for water activities."
1,Very satisfied with this phone case..  Shipped promptly and was as described.
1,Love it! I'm It could store 3 cards max
1,"Finally!  This RAVPower 6 Port Desktop Charging Station is wonderful.  Both my wife and I are heavy tech users and each with a mix of systems and brands; pretty much everyone in our situation has a power strip nearby that is polluted with plugs and chargers for laptops and tablets, phones and accessories, driven by Microsoft and Apple and Google and Bluetooth.  The iSmart Technology in this powered charger allows me to use one plug on the power strip to charge up to 6 different devices with differing input power needs, and the only common denominator is USB.  I now have two of these, one each for my wife and myself, am thrilled with both, and recommend them highly."
1,"[[VIDEOID:878adf1360dc96064c2774c3adaef4dc]] So your looking for a charging dock for your desk or office but your not too sure if this is the one for you?<br /><br />Watch in HD here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6ve_X3SOMk<br /><br />I was sent this sample from G-Hub Amazon UK for an honest review.<br /><br />If you don't have an iOS device but instead an Android, Windows or Blackberry smartphone this dock is also compatible.<br /><br />What's great about this product<br />Stylish and solid build<br />Charge the Apple iPhone & Watch at the same time<br />Great for looking at apps/notifications or watching movies while on your laptop/desktop<br /><br />If you have an Apple Watch you can attach the magnetic charger to the dock, otherwise you will need to use your own charging cable for your smartphone.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it to all."
1,Good buy!
1,Love the pens my husband sticks one in his shirt for coviinence it's there when ever he needs it .
1,"Beautiful case, well constructed considering the low price. After having the case for about a month, color is fading a bit on the spine of the case."
1,Love my gadgets. Thanx
1,Excellent product!
1,"Great device; just beware of the restarting problems that i'm having. Cant run too man programs at one time, but what do you really expect."
1,Excellent charger for the price and great length
1,Works perfectly.  Very satisfied.
1,Save yourself expense and frustration down the road.  You don't find stronger and more reliable cables for less money than these.  The braided nylon jacket prevents the normal cracking and breaking of the wires near the Lightning plug. These cables are strong enough to allow you to use your device while it is charging.  The added length is also a welcome addition to the standard 3 foot long cable. I liked them enough order more than one. Highly recommended.
-1,Was not compatible with an 04 Tundra which it claims to be
-1,I cleaned my band due to getting dirty & unfortunately my band has now turned white and I am very unhappy about that.  The color also started coming off during my cleaning.
1,as expected
1,"You Must Buy This One in the event that You Travel A Lot. It Has huge Capacity, i charge my galaxy s6 about 3 times.The 4 LEDS give me an estimated sign of the charging and remaining status. Which is Great For Android Mob. Telephones in the event that You Watch Movies a considerable measure While Traveling."
1,"Simple fast car charger. Works as intended. Can charge multiple devices at once, which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />In hindsight it is a bit large in width. Would be nicer if it was a 2x2 square instead of 4x1, but it functionally works as expected.<br /><br />4 stars overall."
-1,50-50. One Doesn't charge my iPad mini from the wall charger.
1,Great
1,"Great band, I recommend it. Looks like the real deal."
-1,Don't buy this product! It stopped working less than three months after I purchased it.
1,Convenient to use
1,Good
1,Item as described.
1,Fits well and looks great! Sometimes has issues plugging in to the headphone jack with aux cord. Maybe need a slightly larger opening so it stays connected better.
-1,Broke where the wire and the adapter meet within a few weeks of owning.  Very poorly constructed.
1,Adorable and fits well.
1,"I was given this product in exchange for a review. I am so glad i purchased this! In my opinion everyone needs an extra, its very nice quality seems like its from the manufacture! The color is identical. I am very pleased!"
1,the colors and good material
1,"Really great case! Good size, weight and durability."
0,It's cute but doesn't fit well because it's to soft.
1,This works well in the car and it shipped very quick and was good price! Thanks my husband loves it!
1,"First let me start by saying I’ve purchased many Anker products over the years, however the Powerline Micro USB 3ft Gray I am writing about was supplied as a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />I buy Anker products because 1. They work as advertised,  2. They hold up (my first purchase was an Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh External Battery which has made two trips to Disney World, and I continue to use often),  3. Great warranty (18 Months) 4. The only time I needed their customer support it was top rate. (helping me diagnose an issue, sending me replacement, ultimately resolving the issue in a professional and courteous manner.).<br /><br />The Powerline Micro USB has tradition Micro USB cable connection ends so its just as easy to use as any other Micro USB cable.<br /><br />Where it shines is its durability due to being built with bulletproof kevlar fiber.  For my purposes, its the perfect cable for use in my car!  The power port in my car is in the arm rest.  While there is a notch for the cable to come out,  unless you hold the cable in place while closing the armrest,  it pinches the cable enough to almost immediately cause marks and shorts in other cables.  This Anker Powerline Micro USB has held up to a week of opening and closing the armrest without any issues, marks or shorts.<br /><br />This cable will also be really good for those on the go who often just toss their cords in their bag.  You wont have to worry about tangles and untangles causing shorts in the cable.<br /><br />Using the Powerline Micro USB cable in my car with the Anker 9.6A / 48W 4-Port USB Car Charger with PowerIQ Technology was a breeze.  Plug one end into the Car Charger,  the other into my phone, and it charges things fast.  Connecting my Nexus 6, 2013 Moto X, and even the dock for my Moto 360 watch,  it charges them as fast as the Car Charger allows.  No slow does due to the cable.<br /><br />Compared to the standard Anker USBcables I’ve used, the casing on the Powerline Micro USB cable is visibly more sturdy.<br /><br />Over all, I’m impressed.  Anker has managed to build a great cable that is durable enough to deal with life in my car, or my backpack,  that can charge my phones at full speed, and I don’t have to worry abou it developing shorts due to the stresses I put on it.."
1,"Works just as well as the one at T-Mobile, and they want 35.99 for it"
0,I would have given this case five stars except the color was not as described. It is not red and teal. It is more salmon pink and teal.
1,"Thin case, fits perfect"
-1,"I received these a week ago and after wearing one of them for 2 days it broke. I'm wearing a different one now, and it is cracked."
1,"***Ok, it's now a couple of months after the installation and I'm upgrading this little unit to 5 stars. It's dialed in, set to my preferences, and now all I have to do is the occasional tweak to the remote knob on the dash depending on the track / genre that's playing through the head unit. There's a respectable amount of bass, it's clean, it's got a good punch and I'm not abusing it at all, just using it to fill in the bottom end. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat if I needed a sub for another vehicle, and I've recommended it to several friends / family that are upgrading their systems as well. Still haven't covered up the blue LED, but it's situated on the dash so when I'm driving, the steering wheel blocks that LED from my eyes... I'm ok with that.**  Had it professionally installed in a '94 Chevy C1500 regular cab under the passenger seat, out of sight. It's paired up to a Pioneer head unit using RCA plugs, and filling in the bottom end for the Pioneer 2 way 4x6 dash speakers and factory 4x6 pillar speakers (pillar speakers soon to be replaced).  First, I bought this on the strength of the reviews I read here on Amazon. I'm happy to say, this sub seems to live up to those reviews. It's only been in the truck for 2 days now, so I'm still dialing it in, but it rocks. Even the installer (who had never seen the LOPRO8 before) was surprised in a very good way as to how nice it sounds and has said he'll be recommending it to his customers looking for something to fit in a small space. No, it won't rattle neighbor's windows 3 doors down the street, and no, it won't vibrate the mirrors on the car next to me at the stoplight, but I'm 53 years old and WAY past that stage. It fills my truck cab VERY nicely without overpowering the rest of the music, which is all I need or want. I spend an hour each way in my truck back and forth to work, and this will make the trip quite enjoyable. I predominately listen to rock, blues, classical and jazz, and so far from Rimsky-Korsakovto Metallica to Al DiMeola to BB King, this sub seems to perform extremely well and I am VERY happy with it.  My only issue is the brightness of the blue LED for the remote knob. Yeah, that'll be covered with something very soon - it's WAY too bright and very distracting."
-1,Need to send back<br />It does not connect
1,"Works as described, really tidies things up on the counter."
1,"This is not Amolded so don't expect this glass to stand up to the came torture your original could. The kit is comprehensive but I suggest using a blowdrier or heat gun before separating the screen from the glue over the LCD.  These tools work but weren't able to separate the glass from the glue on my phone. Mine does say Samsung in the glass, and looks like the original. Just know the glass is not as resilient."
1,"I should have gotten one of these a year earlier than I did, so I could stop carrying my laptop around whenever I had to give a presentation. Now I can do it all from my tablet, which is so much easier for travel, even to and from work."
1,"Awesome product, like always I've come to expect from iCarez team.  Get this Glass, you Won't be disappointed!! :)"
-1,I think mine were broken.  The high frequencies didn't come through.  I sent mine back.
1,Ok screen protector.  Had a hard time getting the bubbles out.
1,"This is a nice case it's ashamed it couldn't my G4 since it is design for the G4 Stylus which is bigger than the regular G4. Overall the product have a solid build and the extras, will let's just say we all love extras. The screen protector and stylus pen were welcome freebies. I question why it didn't fit my G4 and the seller wrote back informing me it was for the Stylus. I the seller offered to replace my case with a refund or with one that fit. I told them no I would keep this one, even though I have no use for it. DON'T JUDGE ME PEOPLE! LOL I just enjoy the look and the feel and for that price I could afford to take the hit, you never know when you would get another phone."
1,This is a nice cover for the new Samsung Galaxy 6 edge plus. It's nice and slim so it doesn't add any bulkiness to the phone. It's not a hard cover but if you want to keep the phone nice and sleek this cover is a must.
0,I bought a bunch of these. They work well out of the box but I find that I am throwing them away more often. I tend to put them through tough use outside and travel and I guess you get what you pay for.
-1,I purchased this for my daughter it takes the entire day to fully charge her ipad.
0,"I liked it and everything, one thing I didn't like about it was how overtime the color wears off that's why I gave it a 3 star."
1,"Works great, I charge my Android phone, iPad, Bluetooth headset all at once, all at full speed. Very convenient that it only uses one wall plug. Must buy if you have multiple mobile USB devices. Ontop of all that, it is made by anker, who has one of the best warranties and customer service in the industry."
1,The wife loves it...that's all that's important
1,great one i like it
0,Good but I feel like it's to small
1,I love it and so doesn't my grandkids...
-1,The paint used to make the sides of the case look metallic was already chipping when the item arrived otherwise the red looks like what is shown in the picture.
1,Great quality!
1,love it
-1,"Terrible, not supported by iPhone 6 or iPad 2. Amazon was great though and issued a full refund.m"
1,Nice and easy to fit.
1,Good product.
1,"This case is so awesome.  Looks very professional, feels great in hand."
1,Excellent...
1,"Works as intended for rapid charging of multiple devices. A bit bulky, but to be expected by a 3 USB car charger.<br /><br />Shipped quick and works as expected. Overall, 5 stars."
1,Great quality for price
1,I have had this now for several months.  It arrived on time and has done everything the manufacturer promised it would do.  It has been especially helpful in tracking my sleep patterns so that I can make necessary adjustments.  I love the info it gives me and I feel great!
1,"First radio, can't go to much in depth on it. After I get my liscence and see what it can do I'll update."
-1,"Horrible quality.<br />It attracts dust inside the screen protector.<br />And don't know how but unintentionally it is getting broken on the sides, and today I took it from my pocket and I saw it is broken completely on the top left corner.<br />I spent $14.99 bucks on this product and it is not even working like a $0.99 worth product. Simply waste of money, tech armor deceives people projecting their stuff as quality but their quality is not even worth a penny.<br />I knew that I have one year warranty on this product, I will see if tech armor will replace the defective piece, otherwise I will write one more review mentioning the type of service I received from them."
1,Great GPS do what it is meant to do.
1,Good product good nuff said
-1,I have to give this a poor review firstly because when I received the screen it couldn't be installed properly because the ribbons wouldn't connect properly. It would take so long to get another screen I decided to move onto a new phone and now that I would like to return the screen in exchange for another (and pay a difference if need be) the seller won't even reply
1,"Update - Sept 10  I have performed additional testing and I found out that the issue is not the battery, is the upgrade to the new Android Lollipop release that I installed in my cell phone some weeks before buying the Anker Battery.  The result of the tests in summary is that the Anker battery lasts at least 3 hours more than the original battery.    I have read some forums and I have implemented several of their recommendations to improve the battery life.  By the way I am very pleased with Anker support, as soon as they read my previous post, they contacted me apologizing and offering to replace the product.  I want to apologize for placing a bad review before comparing the Anker battery with the original one.  =============================================================================================== [Old Review] Battery doesn't last.  It even lasts less than the original one that i replaced."
1,So handy to have a back up battery especially with grandkids using my phone... True to advertisement and quick shipment
1,Great
1,"Great value, soft and have a nice grip.  Fits my phone well.  The only thing I hoped was the option to chose one color if I wanted with a  cheaper price.  I definitely didn't need this many cases..."
1,Perfect fit. Just read the instructions.
1,"The case is exactly as described, fits perfectly and is comfortable to hold. I love the colors."
0,is pretty cheaper but the quality is not the best
-1,This does not fit the screen on my iPhone 6. It is too small. Cell 4 Tech did not offer any solution.
1,Worked well and was easy to install with all the needed pieces.
-1,Broke within a week. Don't recommend
-1,"Since using PowerBear, my phone periodically reboots without warning as heat of battery causes it to shut down.  Great idea but this has not been product tested enough to be considered as a quality, market-ready product."
-1,Ear hooks be within 1 week.
-1,poor quality! There is a crack on the holder.
1,Love this case!
-1,Very cheap and bad quality. Fell off the first day.
1,Great case! I like how slim it is while still feeling like it provides a fair amount of protection.
1,Great device would recommend it
0,it works great! i use it daily and track my sleep as well! the app works good! but just recently it just died! i've only had if for 2 months!!
1,Repeat purchase.  Works great.
1,"Nice band, great addition to my collection."
1,"So I bought this at the best buy store.. Anyways this a great phone guys.. It's really quick, it rarely lags I have the 1gb version but its more than enough for snapchats, Facebook and more. Camera is really good in bright scenarios, at night not so much. Snapchats look amazing on this phone I was honestly impressed. And the built quality is great a bit on the plastic side but feels solid, the screen is bright. You don't need more than 720p it looks great to me and it helps the battery a ton although it takes awhile to charge. So make sure you charge before bed, but the battery lasts a lot. It's a great buy! It does more than enough for everyday needs and more. Im cla college kid whos always on the phone abd im telling this phone is amazing. Definitely recommend anyone, even if they are not on a budget."
1,"I loved the case!  It fits my phone snugly.  You do have to press kind of hard for the buttons on the side, but it's really not that big of a deal!  Love it!"
1,"Love it, the quality is very good. Fit perfectly!"
1,"This portable battery charges my phone faster than the actual cable! The only negativity I have towards this product is that it takes a bit of time to charge BUT that was stated in the manual. The size is fine in my opinion, it is bigger than average battery packs but it charges my phone within reasonable time. My sole intention for this purchase was to use during vacation and in school.<br />A unique feature of this battery pack is the flashlight that is activated when you press down the power button.<br />The functionality of this battery is simple and it doesn't require to much time to grasp the concept of this battery."
1,"Very happy with the case!  It looks fantastic and is great quality --- especially for the price.  Received it earlier than expected which is always a bonus.  One minor downside ---- when using credit card slot, the case does not touch the phone screen thus the screen does not automatically go into sleep mode.  Still very happy with purchase and would buy again."
1,The case showed up in a timely manner. Was exactly what I ordered and has a really great feel to it. The little kick stand that allows you to prop the phone up works great and was something I didn't even know I wanted. Would reccomened great quality and product.
1,"Definitely a time saver when charging your device, or just needing your phone's micro USB for something else. The only downfall I have had with this, which isn't a fault of the device, is you need to position the device almost perfectly for it to charge. There is a (blue) charging indicator light that goes around the entire front of the device; it changes green when you're at 100%. Very convenient for travel as well."
1,"I was originally looking for a way to reduce alternator noise. After reading online info, seemed the best thing to do was find a way to take my high level speaker inputs that were run directly into the high level amp inputs from oe system and make them low level inputs for lower distortion. This unit not only turned my 4 channel speaker outputs into 6 channels. it combined it all into full range for the ft and rear and low for sub channel. It has adjustable bass levels and ... no alt whine.<br />Id give it 5 stars but I'm picky and it would be much nicer to have a separate max light for all 3 outputs, not just 1. Takes a little fiddling to get it right. but all and all very nice addition to the system. very happy."
-1,Lasted a week....
1,Im happy with it and love the price. It came very quickly
-1,"This product is not worth the money,SCAM it is. GO burn your money else where, It crashes like your windshield. If there is a negative star, I would rated it as (-)."
1,"I don't normally post reviews, but really like this item. Not only the  item, but the excellent service. When it first arrived the envelope was half torn open with missing parts and when I called they immediately sent me a label to send what I received back to them. The replacement they sent got here literally the next day, before I even had time to return the unused parts. I paired it with my tablet, and it works very well. The sound is good and seems to noise cancel as well.. I originally bought them for my Dad to listen to on his tablet and who has a hard time hearing. This is lightweight and will be perfect for him. I liked them so well, I am ordering another for myself."
1,"Sound quality is pretty good (heavy on the bass). They pinch my ears a bit, so if you have a larger head they might not be for you."
1,great
1,loved it so much bought one for my mother in law<br />With stood my dog chewing on it<br />and had for while now and still working and i use and move it around daily
1,Love this cute case. Nice and thin yet protective.
-1,I returned this. I dropped my phone from barely 4 feet off the ground and my entire screen shattered. I would say if you are going to use this case get a tempered-glass screen protector because it's NOT a hard case. I upgraded to the otterbox commuter...
0,Convenience of having multiple devices charge at once. Appears to be high quality. I don't notice any significant change in charging time with this unit.
-1,Does not stay on
1,"Quickly charges 2 iPhone 6 + simultaneously, much faster than 1 iPhone 6 +, which uses the Apple charger.  Would have been even more valuable if it included Euro adapter."
1,It was just what I wanted!
1,"very nice hub, especially liked are the powered ports"
1,I like the arm band/phone case because I can gain easy access to the phone and my MapMyRun app on my runs. Didn't use the protector because it's too permanent.
1,"lightweight to use for my phone, great price"
1,"Fits my phone perfectly and not mention, protects my phone as well"
1,I love this case. Easy to hold. Buttons easy access and the gold matches perfectly. I'd buy it again.
1,So far works as advertised. Haven't tried multiple devices at once yet but have charged iPhone 6+ and iPhone 6s.
1,Great length. Came just as described.
1,"These are amazing! I have ordered several for friends and family. The warranty is unbeatable, I actually did drop my phone and it did its job and just shattered the protector. The company sent me a new one at no charge."
-1,"Worked in the immersion test but immediately ruined the phone first time it was immersed with the phone in it. So you think, you get what you pay for, right?Ruined a phone with a real Lifeproof that had a crack in the edge of the rubbery seal. That one at least worked for a few months but Lifeproof did not honor their warrantee with two of three cases that broke inside the first year. Lies, dishonorable practices and planned obsolescence."
1,Works great!
1,"Good quick charge, and also charges very much fast."
1,Exactly as expected...great item fast shipping.
1,I received these in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />They arrived promptly and as described.<br /><br />This charging system arrived in easy to open packaging and was simple to assemble.  My IPhone 6 didn't have a problem connecting and charging with this cable.  They are thicker than some of the less expensive models I've owned in the past.  Love it and would recommend it to anyone.
1,This is the best car mount holder ever.
1,"This is an unbiased review of the Maxboost slim case. When I received the product I looked over the overall quality of the product. It is very nice and has all the right cutouts.<br /><br />I tried putting on the case and it was a little hard, snapping it on was an issue for me. After putting on the case I saw the protection wasn't that great but it's a sacrifice for a slim case. If you buy this case it mostly like getting the Apple cases, without a bigger lip to protect from damage to the front of the device.<br /><br />The case is very slim, I have a glass screen protector and I recommend if you buy the case your get the Maxboost glass screen protector as well. It's also slim and you won't get a thick protector. Incase you drop your device this is something great to have."
1,excelente
1,"Product arrived quickly, quick to install and works perectly with my Galaxy S 5."
1,Excellent price and quality. Fast delivery.
1,Fast delivery. Will recommend

-1,Not five months old and it sucks.
1,Robust and so far effective. Excellent guide how to apply it.
1,I love it!!!
0,I haven't used it yet adn the two prongs are already loose and flimsy.  I'll put some gorilla glue on it before I use it on my next trip to Italy.  I'll update after that.
1,"excellent quality strap with low price, timely delivery"
1,Works great! Excellent price!
0,"Works well in town, but sound got noisy and fuzzy while up in the mountains."
0,Pretty but no real protection.
-1,No longer works after 4 days.  Tried removing the phone case and even using it with no case at all but all attempts are futile.  Save your money and frustration.
1,my son loves this.
-1,"I purchased these on June 10th, 2015. As of August 27th, 2015, they stopped working.  They were great until then. I got 20 uses out of them before they died. I had a replacement set sent to me, and now the audio will not work on the replacement set. I would say I've had close to 20 uses out of them again this time. I only charged this pair twice before having issues."
0,"Product arrived on time as expecteded, however product had broken part and bottom looked a little beaten up. I was able to glue piece on. Product works as intended with no real issues. Next time I will make one instead of buying one cause construction is sub par."
1,"Bought this for my child for emergency purposes. I love the all the features, esp the ability to connect via wifi.  Even though it has 3g the connection is just was fast as my 4g phone."
1,Fast and good quality
0,Not bad
-1,"42 days.<br />I had planned to write a review based on the quality of this product as it certainly appears both sturdy and well made and it comes in an impressive box.  But I thought I should wait for three months to see if it lasts since it seems that is when it has been failing for many.  Mine lasted 42 days.  I was out of town and didn't take it with me for a week of that time so actually I got just over four weeks use out of it.<br /><br />There are plenty of choices for 30 pin connectors, but based on a clear failure rate that seems to indicate this won't last for more than 12 weeks and may not last four I highly suggest finding an alternative.  Although it does appear like a well made item, internally it clearly has a fault.  I hate to give anything a one star review but four week's usage is a new low, suggest alternatives to this one."
0,"I received this product, and I really liked it. But the only issues I had with this product was the case was slippery the material could have been made with a material that prevented slippage. Overall the product was good. Will recommend this product."
1,beautiful
1,"This case is pretty cool I must say. I took it out of the packaging and it feels sturdy and extremely durable. I love the pink on pink color combo with the white accent. I have a white iPhone 6 plus so it looks just like the picture. I would not recommend it if you had a black iphone 6 plus. it'll look funny. The other thing is for some reason my iPhone fingerprint does not work with the case because the case edges are kind of lifted to protect the corners a bit more than other cases. Not sure if it is a good thing or bad thing. I also have long nails so maybe those 2 clash. I just took off my passcode and fingerprint so I can get into my phone if I need to. Other than that, super cute, and great price! I received this at discount in exchange for my honest review."
1,good for price
-1,"The really really bad:<br />1) I think that these headrests are potentially unsafe in a rear-end collision.  They tilt quite far before they hit the tilt limit (the whole headrest tilts, not just the screen) and the connection between the posts (that go into the seat) and the headrest is plastic.  I just am not at all confident that they would actually protect my neck in a rear-end collision.<br /><br />2) Problem 2 is that the audio did not work.  No sound out when headphones were plugged in (not sure if these have internal speakers or not, but also no sound when no headphones were plugged in.  Checked the operation of the DVD player (working fine), tried a few different head phones, no luck.  Contacted Pyle, and they said to return it.<br /><br />The good: They fit my car well (2006 Honda CRV) and were fairly easy to install.  There are included post shims for use with cars with different sized head-rest holes (NOTE: 2 of these shims have slots cut in them - the instructions don't say, but I think these are to allow the latch on the seat to engage the notches on the headrest posts) and the posts adjust side-to-side to allow for different post spacings.  There is a mechanism to keep the head-rest centered."
1,"The clip fell apart the first time I tried to use it. Even though it fell apart the seller stood behind it, Very happy with the seller."
1,Got it for my daughter she loves it
1,"These bands are probably the best sport bands you can get for the price. Considering apple sells them at $50, I consider these bands are closest to the identical ones that apple sells. I have purchased 2 already and plan to purchase more. I really hope they provide more color options in the future as I will purchase more of them."
1,Works great!
1,Excellent
1,"Alright so i eceived this sample from Maxboost for my unbiased opinions. and here it goes.<br />When it first came in I was EXTREMELY skeptical. BUt let me say, the appearance is deceiving. Initially i thought, waterproof? No way in HELL am I ever going to use this in the water. NOPE! Then i tested it out like it told me to. Ended up going to the lake the SAME day. Of course dropped it in the sand, nothing happen which is awesome because usally taking your phone to the lake or beach or river you ALWAYS manage to take home a little bit of dirt. Anyways I even went swimming with it on my chest, still nothing happen! Of course i still got scared thinking omg omg omg my phone's totally going to be screwed, but NOPE! And i fell in love!! Sure i still got scared but it's soooooo impressive! It looks like it's made out of crappy material but man i even took it to my first music festival!! Highly recommended!!<br /><br />Protection wise if you drop your phone it probably will crack or something. It's VERY lightweight. So i'd just recommend using it for special occasions.<br /><br />One thing i didn't like was i was trying to take a video underwater and it wouldn't let me. So even if you want to take photos underwater you'll have to use the button on the side of your phone which is cool too. But i wish you could have taken videos as well. BUt you can't have it all!"
1,"Really very functional - quick delivery, absolutely loved it. Top marks!"
1,"nice quality, holes deep enough for the USB cord to fit in.  Very pleased.  I would definitely order this<br />product again."
1,"works great, it is better than the one that came with the gps!!!"
1,I love It...
1,The case was good quality and exactly as pictured.  A bargain for the price.
1,So far the two we purchase have preformed well. Hope they continue to hold up😉 thx!
1,Love that it's wireless; Bluetooth. I use it on the go. It's loud and clear.
1,"The phone is very well sealed inside this case, so sealed i have issues getting it opened to chsrge my phone. (Charge cord protective piece is hard to take out) .  I like the wristband it really helps with not dropping the phone. I do not like that is not adjustable. Packaging was great i feel  my phone is safe when it comes to water . So im guving 4 stars. Improve the charge ports seal and the wristband . And ill give this a 5 star and he willong to pay more."
1,Very nice and fairly priced
1,Love my case just as expected
1,Great product for on the go people.
0,"Fits well, it's nice because the bottom is open so you can plug it into docking stations.<br /><br />Only downside - the image scratches off easily ,"
1,Good quality and good timing of shipping
-1,"The layers in which the phone is inserted, make it very difficult to remove it from the holster. The layers automatically snap off from the phone, making it much too hard, to quickly remove the phone from it's holster and answer calls. This holster case is good to protect the phone from minor damages; however I don't recommend it as a phone belt holster. Additionally, I received it late and with no user instructions.<br />I'm very unsatisfied with this &#34;Holster Case.&#34; I Don't Recommend it."
1,perfect
1,It works great and I received it very fast
1,Niceeee!
1,Charges devices very quickly
1,I'm Happy with it!!
1,So far so good.
-1,"Beautiful....but the camera  has stopped working. I tried several  ways to see if it would work, but without success."
1,Good price and when I asked if they could try to get it her faster they did and I'm extremely satisfied! Came in a nice package plus idk why people were whining about the head phones they were clear and loud to me! Maybe people need hearing checked and or maybe my ears are just really good or maybe some people rather make there ear drums vibrate like crazy till its hard to hear for an hour or something I'm not sure! The only thing is I'm with straight talk so its not the phones fault my internet is so slow!
-1,"The item is simply crap. Not only that I received it more than a week to late, the item is not at all like described! CHEAP CHINA PRODUCT!"
1,great
-1,"It looks so cheap, hard time putting my iPhone inside"
-1,units came as described in packaging...very good shape. Units advertise 35 mile distance...I haven't been able to get them to work effectively beyond about a mile...hoping they do better on the water...but so far not what I was looking for in terms of performance.
1,"Great Product for a reasonable price. It does take some time to charge, however, it holds a decent amount of charging power!"
1,"using this to take video on my iPhone that requires hands-free or prolonged stability. Pros: Good price, stable relatively large base clamp, stable easy-to-use clamp on the phone end, easy to manipulate the shape of the arm. Cons: when the arm is more fully extended or hangs against gravity far from the clamp, it has a tendency to sway/bounce with minimal disturbance (e.g., wind, vibration)."
1,"Amazing product, the most fastest charger ever seen! fully recommended!"
-1,"It's a great design I like the way it attached to the cover, but the cover spontaneously broke! Kinda disappointed"
1,"I purchased as a gift for my wife and she love it, my strategy was simple 1 apple watch with the sport band in apple store and many bands in amazon."
1,great one i like it
1,"Excellent Price<br /><br />Great product, great quality."
1,I gave this selfie stick as a gift. The person I gave it to really likes it and is happy with it and the quality.
1,Love it
1,This is an okay product. It had a hard time holding my LG G3 without a case and did not fit into the vent very well. It kept on swaying left and right due to the clip not being small enough to create a good grip.
1,"This product amplifies my computer output to my free standing speakers, very good sound."
1,This is the second time I've ordered this phone case which shows how much I really love it! Very fashionable 💁 the only thing I wish is that the material last a little longer. Other than that loveeee it and the prices are awesome and free shipping 😊😊😊
1,Excelente
1,"It's come to my attention that many people don't really understand what they are buying when they buy a power bank, also known as an external battery. So I'd like to start by briefly covering what a power bank is and what the various terms mean that are used when discussing them. If you're already an expert on this topic, please skip the next two paragraphs to read my experience with this product. If you simply want the summary, go to the last paragraph.<br /><br />A power bank is nothing more than an external battery that you can use to power and / or charge just about any device that has a cord that connects to a power source via a standard USB port. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and configurations, but there are really only three things to look for when looking at performance. One is the number of USB ports on the device, another is the amperage (listed in milliamps or amps) available through each port and lastly, the total amount of energy stored in the battery, which may be referred to as &#34;capacity&#34; for which the units are usually referred to in milliamps per hour or mAh. If you have a newer Android smartphone or tablet that you want to charge, then you want a power bank that offers a 2 amp USB port. If you have an iPod or iPhone, you can generally get away with a single 1 amp port, but I always recommend having at least one 2 amp port. A power bank with more than one port will, in theory, allow you to charge more than one device at a time. The thing to keep in mind when shopping for a power bank is that manufacturer claims are often inflated to at least some degree. The most often exaggerated feature is the mAh capacity of a power bank and total amperage output is a close second. Capacity is important because more capacity allows you more device &#34;up-time&#34; per charge on the bank.<br /><br />Over the past several years, I've been asked by a variety of sellers to test and review their power banks, and while I always did my best to accurately review each item, it was impossible to get precise, quantitative data on the performance of the banks because the only way to do so is if you have proper testing equipment. You can give anecdotal evidence like &#34;It charged my tablet quickly,&#34; but you really can't measure the mAh capacity and the amperage put out at the USB ports with any kind of accuracy. Writing informative and accurate reviews is extremely important to me, so I've since acquired testing equipment that allows me to get precise and accurate data regarding the capabilities of a power bank or charger; and I have to admit I'm excited to finally know without a doubt that I'm giving accurate information about a product.<br /><br />All that being said, here's what I found with the OLALA C2-i 6000mah Portable Charger ...<br /><br />It has 1 USB port and one built-in retractable Lightning plug on a 2 inch wire, a power button and a four light blue power level indicator and roughly measures 6&#34; x 2 1/2&#34; x 3/8&#34;. The built-in Lightning cable has a 90 degree end that is too wide to fit my iPod Touch 5G with its Otterbox Defender case installed, so I had to trim the insulating rubber surrounding the plug with a razor blade (see picture) and it now fits and charges my iPod just fine.<br /><br />I received my sample of this product and fully charged the device, which took only a short time, as it was mostly charged on arrival.<br /><br />Using a Load Inducer, I placed a 2.4 amp load on the USB port and was able to draw that power for 5 minutes without issues. Next I used the load inducer and a power monitor that measures total power consumed (mAh), and placed 1.8 amp load on the power bank, and it provided 3,580mAh at 5 volts (4,838 mAh at 3.7 volts). I charged the unit back up and ran the test again with the power bank ultimately putting out 3627 mAh at 5 volts (4,901 mAh at 3.7 volts).<br /><br />Power banks use a 3.7 volt battery, as do most cell phones, but the USB standard is 5.0 volts, so the energy must be converted from 3.7 volts at the powerbank to 5 volts for output, and then back to 3.7 volts for use by the device being charged. Because of the voltage conversion and other factors involved, there will always be some energy lost, so no power bank will put out 100% of stated capacity to the device to be charged.<br /><br />In summation, this power bank is capable of putting out 2.4 full amps and it will easily put out a steady 1.8 amps (and maybe more) for the duration of the charge, which is more than enough to charge any device you might have. Having a power button helps keep the bank from slow draining when not in use, and the blue LED lights indicating percent of power remaining and charge status is definitely a plus. 4,900 mAh is enough to greatly extend the battery life of a tablet, and charge pretty much any phone two or three times. My testing indicates this power bank puts out 82% of advertised capacity and that puts it somewhere in the range of &#34;good&#34; to &#34;very good&#34;. Anything above 90% of stated capacity is considered excellent and of the dozens of power banks I've tested and reviewed, only one or two have broken the 90% milestone. This power bank does a good job, and I'd like to rate it 5 stars; but the 29.99 price tag (at time of review) makes it a little on the expensive side for a power bank with its capacity. Still, the built in Lightning cable is an added value that most of the competition doesn’t have and that may very well make this a worthwhile buy for iOS users. I’d rate it 4.5 stars if it were possible, but I can’t do that, so given the good performance and the uncommon feature of a built in Lightning cable, I’m going to round my rating up and not down.<br /><br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟ts, so the energy must be converted from 3.7 volts at the powerbank to 5 volts for output, and then back to 3.7 volts for use by the device being charged.

1,This was a gift. My husband says it charges his iPad very quickly.
1,It's a soft case but I've dropped it twice and it certainly acts like a hard case!  Colors are great.  Had several comments.
1,Worked out perfectly
1,Using it for my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 on my work desk. It will hold the phone vertically without falling over.
1,"This is a great case, stylish, rugged.  It does add a bit of bulk, but less than others with a similar level of protection.  Feels good in the hand.  It makes my HTC One M9 feel like a Moto X, Which I always like the feel of."
1,Love this. Wish it had a wrist strap but otherwise it is great.
1,I really love this case. It looks exactly as described in the photo. It's so chic and classy. One of my favorite cases thus far. Great find :)
1,"I'm really liking this thing.  It is sad that the phone chews up battery so quickly but this turns out to be the answer.  Of course, I no longer have a thin and svelt phone ... it does stick out a bit now.  But no so much as you'd think.  I'd put up with a much thicker battery if it would last twice as long as this one.  As to metrics, I've gone from getting about 4-5 hours standby with the OEM battery to a full day or longer with this.  It is wonderful to not have to pack a couple of spares and two chargers when I go out."
1,"This was a good fit I like that the key board is very secure and won't fall out. The color is darker than I expected, but is still OK."
1,good grip
1,nothing is wrong
1,they work as advertised..
1,Love this case! I use it everyday and it's saved my phone on many occasions
1,"I ordered the grey one, but it came gold.  And I actually really like it better.  I also didn't realize it had the screen cover, but I really like that too.  Especially that you can answer the phone without opening it.  Nice, durable, and it looks great."
1,This is my second purchase of the same product. Fits my ebook reader perfectly with a very reasonable price
0,Does not charge the battery any faster than plugging the Virb directly into a USB port.
-1,This item sucks!!  Had it on my phone for not even ten minutes and when i go to slide my finger down on the screen the whole screen protector moved with my finger. The screen doesnt stay stuck to my phone. It is pointless and a useless product.  Waste of money
1,"Eventually, I found something working well in my car!  Now I don't have to hold my iphone all the time!  Great!  I would definitely recommend this to my friends!"
1,I love it sounds great
1,Great valueg
1,like the camera feature and photos taken w/ the phooe are clear and nice
1,"I've recently upgraded from my old 3 year old? Note 2 which was a great phone, but it started to get slow this year and I knew I had to upgrade. After watching a few YouTube videos I felt that this phone was the fastest on the market when it comes to multitasking (which I do a lot.) It's been about a month since I bought the One M9 and all I can say is &#34;impressive, fluent, unique, and beautiful&#34; the fastest phone I've ever held, the longest battery life I've ever seen, it's durable, loud, vivid and eye catching. Everything you could want in a phone even if you are an iOS or Windows OS user :)"
1,Great!
0,Its OK but I expected it to keep charge longer than one day.
1,I love it went to the beach and swim under water with it recorded video
0,"Came a day early before the earliest estimated date!I looks nice,feels comfortable,and seems somewhat protective. But, around the camera the cutout looks as if it were cut on the right side. This case also tends to slip off the phone at times, which caused my tempered glass to shatter due to lack of protection."
1,This is a great case for the phone. I am a big fan of the OtterBox cases. They WILL protect your phone. Please be aware though that the cases are large and make the phone bulky so just be ready for that.
1,"Love it, every now and then it falls down but its still good."
1,Just what I ordered. Good quality and came the next day.
-1,Battery arrived dead. I charged it but would not hols a charge. Seller was easy to accommodate the refund but I should not have had to pay for the return shipping since the product was obviously defective.
-1,I have had this product since June 2015 and it would not take a charge after 3 months. Vendor not willing to exchange. What a disappointment
1,"A little too small in width for galaxy Note 4 with UAG case, but it can fit in and the velcro is secure."
-1,"Didn't fit, case seemed to small at the bottom so my phone wouldn't really sit in it."
1,very well made and super strong
1,lifesaver
1,[[VIDEOID:b135924d8428172912fc2f7a7fb3739]] This mount held my phone without any problems while I was driving down a dirt road at high speed.
1,"Fits perfectly into the S5 with very little work needed. Wonky delivery system, but still arrived quickly. If my friend broke her charging port cover for a third or more time, I'd buy this again."
-1,I've had a similar product before that lasted me over a year. This thing fell off within a day...
1,Great adapters
0,Not good material to be goIng in and out of your pocket.it does hold up well so the product was just okay..fast shipping
1,"Looks great, feels great, and arrived on time!  Thanks!"
-1,It's low quality and it didn't fit my phone
1,Good headsets. Work well and hold a charge for a long time.
1,wife loves it
-1,They would not charge iphone 6 and iPad 4
1,Seriously the best glass screen protector out there. I highly recommend it and would choose this every time. Their cases are great as well.
1,It is useful when you exercise.<br />Do not go heavily into the pocket.<br />And you can use both hands freely.<br />Especially if you like jogging would be a very useful item.<br />Thanks to the secret deal club who can experience inexpensive.
1,item arrived quicker than expected and works great.
1,great product
1,"This Liger XS400 is very manageable to use especially when you are driving and wants to talk using your phone hands-free. It is very lightweight and can be rotated depending on your comfort level. You can use it for either left or right ear and the earpiece doesn't hurt your ear. I have tried it using my iPhone 6, iPad table and Samsung Galaxy tab and all works perfectly fine as long as you can connect it to a bluetooth. I did not have any problem with the sound and speech volume. This only come in one piece so don't get frustrated if you only see one, the purpose is to make use of the device at a portable state. I got this at a promotional rate to give honest feedback on the product and it has served its purpose well."
1,"Good deal for the money.  Offers some protection from impact, and makes the phone less likely to slip around and get damaged."
1,Shipped quickly and works perfectly! It even came with a screen protector.
1,husband loves it
-1,Was disappointed with the case and even more when I realized the back cover was coming off straight out the box but the customer service was great despite that.
0,"For some reason, this tracking unit doesn't keep battery power.  In other words, I have not really been able to test it out because it is using up batteries in a matter of days.  When I have tried it, it seems a bit vague as to whether the tracked location is close-by, near-by or in the general area.  (Not specific enough to be helpful).  Good concept but not useful due to the battery (CR2032) issue."
1,"Absolutely outstanding battery life and water resistant, for these two reasons I bought it to double as my bike computer.  Now onto the weaknesses, no flash for the camera and is pretty mediocre.  If you don't need the battery life I would go for the latest moto G instead for the better screen and camera."
1,Perfect cover for my ASUS phone....
1,"Perfect case. It is incredibly thin, looks excellent, and provides great protection for your phone. You really couldn't ask for more out of a case. I would pick it over Otterbox every time."
-1,"After a few days, my ear started hurting. I have normal sized ears. Connectivity is good though. Also, only one piece is included."
1,Stays on good and looks nice!
1,A highly affordable and nicely built six port USB power adapter that comes handy all around home and while travelling. Working without any problems so far.
-1,I don't think this case would ever hold up to even a day of my life!
-1,"center metal screen rusted out quickly, not very pleased with this product."
1,Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
-1,"Biaoge should be ashamed of themselves for offering such a worthless piece of junk. This item broke the second day of use! If they have any integrity, they will contact me to offer a full refund. Read the reviews and look elsewhere."
1,"Wow! For these items I received an amazing PROMO Code and all I have to do was write a review. Best deal ever, can't get these in store. I will shop with them again in the future."
1,Awesome product. i would totally recommend it!! Small speaker but with great sound quality. Radio works just fine.
-1,"I was so excited about getting this phone. I like the size and all the features. It arrived just as expected in two days. I had phone for a week now. Today, all of a sudden when I went to make a call, the receiver can not hear me. I did everything told to get volume, nothing works. Looks like I will have to send phone back.....disappointed"
1,Product was exactly what expected and advertised.  Satisfied with my purchase.
1,"It works it charges my phone, its cheap enough and looks decent, its hard to find high quality accessories for anything not an iPhone, which is a little bit of a head scratcher for certain Android flagship phones like docks with speakers and high quality cases specifically I've been looking for a waterproof case for my galaxy note 4 none of the big names make one, but they have several for each gen iPhone.<br />Wow this one got off topic quick, bottom line this dock fits and works not the most elegant but more then suitable for what I need it for."
1,"Really good case with a strong magnet. Good feel. The slot on the inside is glued shut and you have to carefully use a sharp knife edge to open the glue joint holding its edge shut. Warning, the slot puts a portion of what ever card you have in it on top of a strong magnet and that will wipe out a magnetic stripe so I suggest not using the slot at all with any card that has a mag stripe ;)"
1,Very nice
1,Was told to upload a picture to process replacement. Very nice looking but was cracked.
1,"Prompt shipping, great case!"
-1,Do not buy. These head phones broke after 3 days after i bought them.
1,"Love the case, it's tough, easy to grip and textured so you can hold onto it easily. The fit is perfect, not to tight that it's a fight to get it on or off. The graphics could be a little sharper, that's my only criticism.  Delivery was much faster than the listing said."
1,Charges really fast. I like it and the length.
-1,Fell apart within two weeks
-1,"The design of the edge to edge ballistic glass screen protector for iPhone 6 plus is pretty much garbage. The ONLY sticky part on the protector is on the actual active screen area. The other sections do NOT adhere to the screen, but instead FLOAT there. This means DUST gets stuck under it and blocks the camera and sensors on the front face. How ridiculous of a design! I wish I could get my money back for this garbage."
1,"Great product.  I've used other types in the past, and this is the best by far."
1,This is an amazing product.  I have been very impressed with the charging time.  It is also very easy to transport using the caribeener hooks included.
1,"Cases for my I phone 6 plus are very limited I have noticed, especially when it comes to cute girly prints.  This is absolutely adorable because pink is my favorite color and I love the two different shades of pink together.  I love that it's very simple to just put on and take off.  This also comes with an excellent screen protector too!  This is a wonderful phone case!  I received this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
1,"Great sound for a small area, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, by the pool, on the beach etc. but for dinners and parties you need to go bigger."
1,Watch as durable it's a nice thick rubber style band Durable.  Screen size is perfect viewing the best you can get for a watch. It has all the capabilities of a normal phone would have. But it sure beats the price of those iPhones.  I plan on getting a Nother one. And I did receive this for a heavily discounted/free to give a honest review on.
1,Absolutely love. Received my order faster than expected too. Exactly like the picture and fits my Note 4 perfectly.
1,It works
1,"The battery works as expected, restoring my phone's battery life to what I estimate is comparable to its original life when my Nexus 5 was new. I've been using the replacement for three weeks with no problems."
1,It was a gift for my son and he was thrilled with it. It's doing it's job and keeping his phone protected.
1,Good fit.
-1,"Seems to work fine for a few weeks but......<br />As time goes by 1,2 have stop working.  I was hoping the new and improved cords would be better.  I have burn marks near the connector.  And smells of burning plastic"
1,"I used this glass screen protector to protect my new LG G3.  So far, it has kept my screen scratch, dust, and crack free.  Admittedly, I haven't dropped my phone, but I've heard the glass screen protectors act as a sacrificial screen should it drop and it will crack before your screen does.<br /><br />I paired this protector with a slim case and together, they look stock on the phone but I feel protected.

-1,"These headphones are great for light activity, but do not stay in your ears for long distance running."
0,Sounds good just a little on the generic side but good for the price
-1,The end piece seperated
1,it was just what we wanted
1,"This is a great pouch; HOWEVER, it is NOT suitable for an iPhone 6 in an Otterbox Defender. The case makes the whole thing just too snug.<br />I ordered the next size larger (Iphone 6 Plus (5.5 inch) PU Leather Pouch with Back Clip and Magnetic Closure), which fits perfectly.<br />Before that I had a smaller one for my iPhone 4s. Love these pouches."
1,Things to note: The Skip/reverse buttons are in opposite locations and when you press the buttons there's an annoying voice that says 'skip foward' or 'play music' I don't like that. All other functions seem to work fine. Battery lasted about one week with normal use (~2 hours a day)
-1,"Purchased in March 2015.  Stopped working in August 2015.  Hey, no moving parts to fail.  The price seemed right at the time of purchase.  Now five months later it seems I've over paid.  Certainly would not recommend based upon my experience with this product."
1,It works.
1,Battery has worked fine after several months of light/moderate use in a standard (non-Smart) cell phone.  Price was great and I am not disappointed in the capability of this slim Samsung battery at all.  Younger &#34;power users&#34; might think otherwise.  It takes a charge as quick as the day I bought it and will go days in between charges (with light use) which is something my Kyocera cell can't do with a fresh Chinese knock-off battery. OEM parts sometimes pay off.  I know it does with my camera batteries.  Just sayin....
1,Excellent. It sure beats the $34.95 that Verizon wanted for the exact same thing.
1,"Serves its function well enough, doubles as a light weight wallet for my wife."
1,I love it
1,love it! great look
1,"Great Wireless Charging Kit for my iPhone and SamsungS6<br /><br />I purchased this wireless charging kit to use for my iPhone 6 and Samsung S6.<br /><br />I have the iPhone 6 but my wife has a Samsung S6 phone, due to Samsung S6 is Qi enabled, so the qi pad fits her phone perfectly well. For my iPhone, there is an iPhone receiver kit in the box, I do not need to buy an extra one, it's really helpful.<br /><br />As soon as I place my iPhone 6 or Samsung S6 on the pad, the pad quickly to start working. Now I just need One charging pad and it’s enough for All our phones.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone looking for a wireless charging solution for their iPhone 6 and All Qi-enable phones."
-1,"Very brittle, broke months after purchase. Beautiful image, but weak."
-1,Good customer service lousy product. Died after two weeks and sound quality just awful. They promptly replaced unit but I'll probably just give them away. Wish I had spend more on better brand.
1,Hard tontake off
1,very pretty just what I wanted
1,"This is a great case that I would recommend to anyone, but I did eventually get another case because it had a stand so."
1,"its the best and beautiful case, whatever it change to yellow some days later, but its so nice"
1,This was another one of my impulse buys and it was just as expected. Only thing I was concerned about was the kick stand doesn't really work and the case is a little bulky making it hard for me to text when it's on but it hold all my cards perfectly and money safely.
1,Great my daughter loves it
1,"It fit just right, could have been little thicher"
1,"Awesome case, handily you can charge the case separately to the phone which speeds up charge time! Only complaint is the speaker reroute is not very good; sounds a bit tinny I drilled two extra holes in the bottom to allow sound to escape the case; seems to have sorted that issue nicely! Just looks like there is a headphone jack hole on both sides :)"
-1,"I attempted to plug my first device (iPhone 5) in when I went to bed.  I received a message stating that the cable was not certified.  Well, no good there.  Considering the listing stated that it WAS, in fact, certified?!  So I went over to my computer and attempted to plug the same device directly into one of it's many USB slots.  No dice!  The next day, I grabbed device #2,...an iPhone 6 PLUS.  I attempted to charge it with the cable.  Once again,..same message.  The final device, and iPhone 5S was plugged in.  Of course, I got the &#34;not certified&#34; message again.<br /><br />****I've included pictures of all three devices and messages.****<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an unbiased/honest review."
1,"Lightweight, but super protective. Love it 💫💫💫"
-1,not leather
1,"Fit perfectly, stopped my phone from overheating when using with the wallet case."
1,Absolutely love this. It does what it says it'll do & it doesn't it with style
1,Nice high quality cover for a very smart price!
1,Love the blue collar that makes our male Weimaraner stylish and quiet!
1,"I've reviewed dozens of DC chargers, but this is only the second one I've seen that offers four charging ports and my testing indicates it performs exactly as the advertising claims.<br /><br />I tested this charger using the same methodology that I employ in the testing of every AC or DC charger I review. Using a [[ASIN:B00KFS4Y1I USB Power Load Inducer and Tester]], I tested each of the ports and was able to maintain a 2.4 amp load on each port. I then left the load inducer on one port set at 2.4 amps while plugging in a Galaxy Note 3, S5 and ASUS T100 10 inch tablet, which I know from experience to draw 1.65 amps, 1.4 amps and 1.6 to 1.8 amps respectively. I allowed this test to run for fifteen minutes and encountered no issues with the charger.<br /><br />My test results show this charger to be a very good product. In this case, being capable of charging four high energy devices simultaneously; and at the price of $12.99 (at time of review) this is priced very competitively. I like it and until something better comes around, this is one charger I won't be giving away.<br /><br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟"
1,GREAT SOUNDING LOW PROFILE SUB
1,"After purchasing many brands and types of screen protectors over the years, Maxboost HD glass screen protectors will be the only screen protectors I will ever buy from now on. Extremely easy to apply as long as you follow the simple directions and have a few minutes of patience to get it straight. Currently we only have two iPhones with this screen protector on them for almost a year now. Neither has yet to show any signs of scratches or chipping, even after one too many accidental falls and hits. It has never shown any issues with the touch screen functionality, nor any lifting around the edges. If applied properly, you would never know it was there. Major perk buying one on Amazon is the price and lifetime warranty that you get. Buying any brand (plastic or glass) screen protector from your local store, starts out at around $25 and up. Save your money and protect your phone with the Maxboost brand on here!!!"
0,Not a true Full Body case as titled. I later saw it says in the description that it does not have a built in screen protector.
0,"The case seems to be pretty good . it is watertight ,the finger print ID on my phone still works, but the screen part seems to scratch easy."
-1,"This case DOES NOT fit a IPHONE 5C, I recently purchased it for my daughter and was extremely upset once I received it. The case is too small. The seller clearly states in the item description that it fits an &#34;IPHONE 5C&#34;...not worth the purchase, time to return and dispute #OVERIT!!"
1,"This is such a neat, compact device.  Love it!"
1,I'm looking to buy 3 more blue family and for is asking for this blu because they are doing fantastic
1,"Excellent in every respect.  The case exceeded my expectations.  Compact, rugged, and secure.  It was delivered on time with a stylus and screen protector."
1,Love it! My phone is charging faster plus it doubles as a micro to std USB chord.
1,it's great!
1,You may want to try ringke but this one is also ok
1,pretty
1,"In that this item is EXACTLY what I needed and isn't easily available locally......I'm thrilled! (OK, maybe it doesn't take much to thrill me these days....)"
-1,"I would have given this 5 stars, however syncing with bluetooth has been a major problem. The first day it worked great. The second day it would not sync and I had to unpair and then pair it up again and got it to work.  The third day even unpairing and trying to pair again would not work and I cannot get them to sync."
1,was nice and slim fitting and slid into my pocket easily
-1,Broke within 3 weeks.  the actual metal piece that attached to your phone came out as if it wasn't even attached in the first place.<br /><br />I have never seen one break that way.  It just came out in its entirety.
1,Arrived quicky and works as stated. Very happy with the screen protector
1,Very good car phone magnet all round.
0,"For an inexpensive smart watch great.  No wifi which would be nice and take notice of the phone carries sim card that this watch will except.  There might be a way to get them all to work, not sure how myself."
1,Great product
1,ggreat!
-1,"It's a cool bumper, but it doesn't really protect the phone.  It also broke quickly."
1,This is a great a product with enough power to charge multiple devises at the same time very fast yet using only one outlet. Very happy with my purchase
1,Works perfectly with my M9 phone. I was able to get my phone fix!
1,I got my case today ..I love the color and the fit.
1,Very satisfied!  Color was a perfect match with phone just as stated.  Couldn't be happier!!
1,"This case goes above and beyond to protect my phone from the elements. I took it on a river tubing trip and tied the lanyard around the handle of my tube. At one point my phone was in the water bumping along the rocks beneath my tube for about an hour. No damage, lanyard held up great. (My note 4 also had a screen protector on it so the screen didn't get hurt).<br />Another occasion I took it to the beach and went swimming with it in the ocean. Took pictures and videos.<br />The only thing thats tricky is when the phone is submerged it doesn't really work well. The plastic clings to the screen and the phone thinks you're touching it all over the place. So it can be hard to zoom and take photos. Works better if you leave a little air in the bag when sealing it. The less the plastic clings to the screen the better."
1,Item was great and will recommend
1,Very Exellent
1,"If your looking for a cheap touch screen and don't care about Bluetooth then this is your unit!! Installation was a breeze all wires are colored as they should be, unit performs all tasks flawlessly very impressed for an 85 dollar unit!"
0,Case was too heavy/bulky
1,Great product!
1,LOVE MY NEW BLU PHONE..
1,It was a genuine product and I love using it. The case looks like a genuine leather and it is strong enough to hold the tablet and safe gaurd it.
0,"I just received today 08/31/2015 but, it doesn't fit my Galaxy S5 Active.  I will have to look for another Armband."
1,great case. handed the phone down to my son and he still has it on the phone.
1,One of the best screen protectors ever!
1,Good battery but slightly on heavier side.
-1,"I had to send a new phone back to the company and pay for postage which they say the put back into my account. Lots of time.<br />New phone did not work, took it to Verizon to verify it was a bad phone.Now I am gun shy on ordering a phone now and what if I have to send that one back. This was for my son who is still currently using a borrowed phone."
0,Glad I only paid $1.50 for this because the metal piece that goes into the phone bent right away!
1,"I really like this case but it just tends to break from the bottom part because its thing in there, I wish they could make the exact same case but made of aluminum, they do have one that's it's made of metal or whatever but it doesn't look like this one so that's why I don't get it."
-1,I'm having so many issues wit this phone... Either the calls drop or I get no service 😔😔😔
1,Great item and fast delivery
1,"Very easy to put on, really like the life  Time warranty"
1,Love it.
1,great
1,Love it
1,"Awesome product very thin and very easy to put on and doesn't get in the way of my case, I will be recommending this to my friends"
-1,Purchased the charger for my husband. After 2 weeks it broke. The front unit popped out. Hoping this is fluke. I plan on returning it.
1,Good product .
1,very good. blue tooth setup easy. sound quality very good. fits and stays snug in ears. best blue tooth headphones I've had!
1,"Solid product if you're looking for a selfie stick. Solid build quality, highly recommended."
1,"sync, charge, do what ever the apple cable do with better quality and durability."
1,Nice price on a nice shield. It was easy to install. Still going strong after about a year.
1,exactly what I needed
-1,What a waste of money and time<br />Ordered 2 chargers last week<br />They were fine for the first week then both of them stopped working<br />Called amazon and returned both of them<br />Still i had to pay for shipping.<br />Do not buy this.
-1,I would give it 0 stars if I could. It doesn't work at all doesn't fit my phone at all. It feels like it was never supposed to work.
0,"the product is strong and durable but I wish it had a flap to hide the credit cards, license, etc when you are talking on the phone.  I don't like having all my personal items exposed when I have it up to my ear.  Otherwise, excellent product and strong."
1,Very basic phone that helped us stay connected on a trip to Europe.
1,Perfect accessory. Worked so well on last trip. No slippage. Why didn't I get this sooner?
1,Perfect
-1,I can not take off my cover on my iPod touch 5
0,"I like that it is glass which is better than those thin plastic protectors. However, no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get a perfectly clean screen. There are tiny pin size imperfections, maybe caused by the adhesive on the sticky side. They aren't bubbles or dirt, just imperfections. Also, the protector does not cover the entire screen because the new phones have curved glass on the edges and they inform you that these are designed to be flat. They can't make the protector full size because it would allow dust to get under the curved part."
1,Works well! Perfect for my phone
1,Great
1,I love it
1,Its excellent and looks like the original gold color of the phone. The touch screen works cery good
1,They work fantastic
1,"Amazing, does what it is supposed to do; protect your phone from water"
1,I was so looking forward to this but it doesn't fit my car's VERTICAL air vent. I gave it to a family member. It was so easy to setup and use. It would have been perfect if it would fit MY car. I didn't want the kind that sticks to the window.
1,fit perfectly..
-1,Very low quality and unbalanced structure.
1,Love this case!!
1,"I had to really consider purchasing a used iphone, but after a lot of research, this one seemed the best for the price and condition. I have had no real problems with it and now I don't even think about it being used.  In fact, I love it!  The one time I had to call the company I purchased it from, they were very responsive."
1,It interfaced with my old Galaxy S3.  I'm still working on figuring it out.  Sometimes I even have trouble getting it to turn on. That cannot be operator error!  Have managed to get some pretty awesome selfies.
1,It's not as pinky as you see online. It's more close to cream-color? But i like it.
1,"Really protects your phone, and will fit comfortably in your pocket"
1,Great product at discount price. Seller delivered as listed.
1,"Best product, no worries where to connect your device."
1,"I already have the other model that attaches to the dash board (or windshield) for my other car, and would recommend this one (but love them both). Less hassle, more convenient, doesn't fall off the windshield, holds in place very well. The strength of the magnet is very good. There is no way it would fall of while driving. You have to use a fair amount of force to take it off.  I guess the only con is that it restricts some of the air flow from the vent, ....but I can live with that."
1,It looks like it's that it would!
1,Works great!  Eliminates searching for multiple outlets to charge &#34;i&#34; devices.
1,"Arrived very quickly, color just as shown."
-1,These worked for about a week.  Now they are useless.
-1,This product was horrible it stopped working in 5 days after I recieved it
1,It is a very nice cover but takes a long time to get here.
1,I love it
1,"In exchange for a fair review, I was given a PROMO code and I am just amazed!"
1,Got for my wife. We really like to take care of our phones. Does what it's supposed to do. Good product.
1,excelent
1,Nice product good secure fit
1,I love this headset cover!  It stays in place and is very comfortable around my neck. The price is good too.  I'm waiting for more color choices especially orange.
1,Great band for running!
1,Nice
1,"Well made and compact, this works great for the DrivePro. Knocking off a star for the relatively hefty price, should have been included with the unit."
1,Love them. Weight is good and the thinner tip makes a huge difference when working on smaller screen. The replacable tips are awesome. I have recommended them often to friends.
-1,"About 7 months after I purchased this unit, one day it suddenly stopped working. I contacted BESTEK because it had one year warranty. They told me to send it back. I sent it back (I had to pay return shipping.) No answer for a month. I sent an email again. No answer for another two months."
1,Very good item
-1,"The case fits over the camera, but it becomes very difficult to use the buttons at the top of the camera. The power button and the the button to open the flash are very hard.  Not taking the buttons into account, the flash was able to open and functioned properly.  On a side note, if you use this case, the camera will fit inside the leather strap case designed for this camera, but that case will not close with this case on the camera.  I ended up not using the case as it was a pain to turn the camera on and off."
-1,i hate it
-1,Did not protect my screen from a 2 foot fall.  Phone slid off a couch and dropped flatly onto a tile floor.  Short drop overwhelmed the tiny lip over the screen and uniformly shattered the screen.  Repair of $109 at Apple Store.
1,It was ok
1,Tk You
1,Fit my 1999 prelude and makes it clean.
1,Case has help up really well over the last few months!
1,Works just fine. Well made. Great value.
1,"Very, Very Happy. Arrived on Time. Nothing bad to said."
-1,"My phone, and lg g3 doesn't fit with the case on. Description says it will fit but that is not true. My case is not large but it still won't fit.  I wouldn't recommend this item."
1,Good product<br />Easy to put on my phone<br />Keeps all functionality of my phone
-1,"I opened up a support case with Plantronics asking for a battery replacement. Well the warranty life is only 1 year, so basically, throw it out or buy a new one is the official answer. The battery will start dying down after a while. This was my second unit. I would recommend looking at other products.I don't think anyone wants to buy a headset brand that need a new replacement every years!"
1,This is a great case to organize all my traveling electronic accessories.
1,Fits my IPhone 6 + perfectly & for the price the quality is unbeatable.. Love this case
1,Great product!
1,"fast shipment, great quality for the price."
0,"I find the inner case fine,  but the belt clip is made of very thin plastic.  The first one broke in a week and the company gladly replaced it, but I feel it should be made of a heavy duty plastic.  To alleviate breakage I leave the phone in the belt clip and just take the whole thing off of my belt to use it."
1,"Simple, convenient, inexpensive and best of all it works. This is a no brained for anyone fishing along the coast"
1,Sturdy
1,perfect fit
1,Nice looking case.  It has a very smooth surface which has caused me to nearly drop my phone a couple of times.  I don't use the stand as often as I thought I would.
1,I've used so many diff clips and they all just fell down. This is the best I've ever used. Doesn't move at all. I recommend it to everyone.
1,Appropriate for the task assigned and great price.<br />No issues with delivery or packaging
-1,"Can not get it to charge can not get it to work, waste of money"
1,"my husband is always losing his wallet, so I did some research and ordered this for him. It has many great reviews. Since receiving this tracker, he has lost his wallet once and was able to quickly log into his phone and trace its location. Thankfully it wasn't far and he was able to locate it quickly. The device also has a setting that will alert you if your wallet and phone be come separated, which would be GREAT for a night out. Overall, I recommend this gadget to anyone who misplaces their wallet regularly. It's a tad bulky, but totally worth it."
1,good
0,It's one of those loose fitting cases with soft rubber. It offers medium level protection which isn't bad for the price
1,Perfect stand.  The iPhone charger is adjustable and can accommodate most cases. Watch sits nicely on the stand.  The fit and finish are great. Highly recommend.
1,I purchased this case for my husband who works in steel and metal manufacturing due to his previous phone case not being able to keep his phone protected from the harsh environment it had to endure on a daily basis. This case protected his phone from paint and metal debris and being dropped on concrete numerous times. I can't say enough good things about the LifeProof brand. I would definitely purchase another Lifeproof case if he buys a new phone.
1,Charges my phone quickly and is easy to use.
-1,One out of the three has already stopped working after a week!<br />Wrote a request and asked if it can be replaced but haven't heard anything back? Think I'm just going to throw the other possible fire hazards away and eat my loss.dont buy
1,This case is really cute and fits close to perfectly! It's sleek and fits well in my pocket without being bulgy and awkward. It looks a bit darker online but the color is still pretty and glossy. I'm satisfied with my purchase!
1,"Fantastic signal, worked great on a four hour drive across Colorado."
1,Bought this cable to charge phone in my bag while commuting. The original Apple cable is long and get tangled and kinks toward the USB port. This is perfect size and fit.
1,"Cute, cute, and perfect for the 7&#34; tablet I ordered to go in it!"
0,"Side piece of case broke as soon as I put it on :/ Nice case, but disappointed in that. Cute colors."
-1,I am so disappointed buying this. Immediately saw a big bubble in the case right after I put it on. I used to have the exact same one from another supplier and it lasted me months until my phone got stolen so I know how long it's suppose to last.
-1,"You get what you pay for on this one.  Unfortunately, they feel really lightweight and cheap, and the stylus only works when fully upright.  You can't hold it at an angle.  Worse (and shame on me for not catching it in the description), the ink in all of these is black.  I don't know that I've ever owned a pen with bright colors like these that only write in black.  Oddly disappointing."
1,Love it!!!! It's great!!!!...would recommend it...💗
-1,"The seller claims this is a leather case, but it is just a cheap &#34;imitation leather&#34; plastic which is all cracked and falling apart after less than two months of use.<br />It looks nice but... CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Do they really think they can full anyone? the picture does, but once you get it, you can quickly realize what a lousy product this is."
-1,Expect what you pay for.
1,Excellent product.
0,"So I love the quick charge! I'd give that a 5/5 stars, but the problem with this is not the charging, it's the durability.<br /><br />I just started using this and on the third night my phone slipped off of my desk and the smaller part of the cable got bent and was almost all the way out. It won't charge anymore and I can't fix it. Also, most other cables aren't compatible for quick charge, so now I'm out a damn good charger.<br /><br />So for the durability I gave it a 1/5 star and the average came out to 3/5 stars."
-1,"This radar detector does not work well in Sg. It does not detect any traffic junction cameras, cannot detect any radar guns, only sounded alert when it was very close to a stationery speed camera (20-30m). It was a pure waste of money and a great disappointment. Perhaps it works in some countries but not in Sg. i wish i could get my money back."
1,"Good sturdy case, took my toddler over a month to break it. Considering she usually only takes a week or two, I'd say that's pretty decent quality for the price."
1,The case is awesome and is very sturdy.
1,I actually enjoyed these and the quality of sound is very good
1,This case is awesome. It has extra rubber protection around the corners. It also comes with a glass protector!
1,Works as expected.  Charges my phone better than the stock Samsung cable.
-1,"I purchased two of these cables this year.  The connector fit nicely through my Speck case just as an official apple cable did.  Unfortunately, neither cable made it past 6 months before becoming intermittent and then failing.  My son used one of the cables and may have been hard on it.  The other was for me and was only used occasionally."
0,"The set screw on the back that keeps the phone in position doesn't work very well. I tightened it as much as possible,  but the phone still twists with vefy little effort."
-1,"I have the thinnest shock-protect case for my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, and it did not fit in the cradle even if I remove the plastic &#34;cover mate&#34; like they show in the picture.  FYI - With my case on the phone, it measures  3 5/16&#34; across.  Returned it for a refund."
0,Started to randomly bubble and peel after only a couple months of normal use.
1,Great covers for the price
1,Good stuff! That case literally fits in with any phones.
1,perfect
1,"UPDATE: After owning this for some time, I will upgrade from a 2 star to a 4 star. The quality is great, it has had no issues and it still looks brand new. I would give it 5 stars if they would have sent me what they send they would.<br /><br />Ok. I think this product is just ok. I feel a little bothered that this product must have changed design from its first go round. This product i received is the one shown - however - if you read the reviews below and look at the images it is clearly a different band. It seems like version one was much closer to the Apple band with the magnetic clasp and infinity design. This one I received - no. It has a gap between the watch and the band and has a clasp instead of magnet. The material is ok. I feel some rough edges (very minor). The brushed stainless looks good but the clasp that attached to the apple watch isn't brushed as nice so you can see a big difference. It was not as easy to on the watch, but I did finally get it to fit on. Overall, I think it will work. I would give it 3 stars if the product was consistent with the pictures other people posted. My suggestion is to discontinue this product number and start fresh so purchasers are not confused. It is clear this was a different product before."
1,"I picked this case up for my wife, and she loves it.  Functional and stylish.  The micro-dots on the backing do a great job of keeping the case from &#34;clinging&#34; to the back of th device.  I'm glad that I stumbled onto the Verus brand.l"
1,I love it!!!!!
0,"They connected easily via bluetooth and the signal and range was reasonable. However, the sound quality was too much on the treble and not enough on the bass making music sound a bit tinny. The form factor is poor as is the fit. The inflexible wire on the back of the head sticks out an inch or two making it impossible to use while exercising on a bench or floor (the wire pushes the headset forward). I purchased this headset with my own money and I returned it."
1,"Love this case, but the cord to charge, are you kidding me ? Way too short, need some length !!"
1,"This glass screen cover is great for my iPhone 6, it's a lot cheaper then the ones they sell in the stores and just as good."
0,"Maybe it's just my 2 year-old phone being picky, but it won't charge my phone with my cord plugged into it. Seems fine with other's stuff though."
-1,The battery didn't work. It wasn't even charged all the way!!
1,The best for the Nexus 5 and protects it perfectly.
1,very pretty!
1,"I ordered the CD slot magnetic holder for my iPhone 6. I don't text or take calls while driving, so this is mainly for GPS purposes. The CD in my car is positioned high on the dash so this holder places the phone within my field of vision while driving. Instructions are included, but probably not necessary. It's pretty easy to figure out. I have the Apple leather case on my phone and the magnetic strips they provided fit with no problems. The magnets are strong enough that I don't really worry about the phone falling off the mount. The only thing that I would say is a negative is that it's a bit wobbly. When going over uneven/rough road, the mount does shake. That said, outside of a window mounted holder or one of the grippy pads on top of your dash, this will be a problem for any CD/vent mounted holder. It doesn't detract from it's usefulness. Plus, it doesn't obstruct my view of the road. Is it perfect? No, but I give it a 4.7 out of 5, which I rounded up."
1,"This case is very slim and looks great on the Space Grey watch. All of the cut outs fit the watch perfectly, leaving the digital crown exposed, as well as the side button. I had only hoped for it to be a little more shiny, but that's not a deal breaker. I'd recommend this to anyone with a Apple Watch Sport in Space Grey looking for a slim case that looks good.<br /><br />PS. I didnt install the screen protector because i already had one on, and the one that came with this case doesnt cover the entire watch face."
0,Didnt last a week before it broke
-1,Do NOT purchase!!!  The pen doesn't work and the stylus doesn't work.  The stylus was like trying to use a pencil eraser!  It was sent from China.  It was a package of two and neither one worked at all.  My money was refunded but it was inexpensive so I'm sure some people just throw them away.
1,Very inexpensive and works perfectly.
1,I love it and everyone that see it wants one.
0,"Its working OK - smaller than what I would have liked.  Its sticky on both sides - so it stays on the dash, but when I pick something off the surface, it sometimes pulls it off.  Its not as good as the last one I had, which I can't find!"
1,It's so pretty and it gets rave reviews but it's the wrong one.I'm going to keep it and give it as a gift. I will order the correct one shortly. Thank you all
1,very pretty color
1,Rapid response and correct parts delivered :-)
1,This tripod adapter fits my iPhone 6 plus with the Otterbox Commuter case with no room to spare but it does fit securely. The product keeps my phone in place while on my Gorilla pos and other tripods. The Bluetooth remote paired easily with my iPhone and it came in very handy when starting and stopping videos and shooting photos.
1,"To be honest, at first blush I wasn't overly excited about this charger. Four ports with a maximum output of 5 amps (aggregate) is no big deal in an AC charger these days. Many newer Android devices (all of the higher end models) and many, if not most larger tablets ship with 2 amp chargers. That being the case, if you have four higher draw devices that you want to charge at one time, then this is not the charger you need. However, this will charge 3 high end Android phones (any I've ever tried draw a maximum of 1.65 amps) or it will charge four any model iPhones, or a combination of Droids and iPhones as long as the total amperage draw doesn't exceed 5 amps. The smart charging feature means that the charger will automatically detect the optimum charging amperage of each device and deliver no more or less to the device.<br /><br />Using a [[ASIN:B00KFS4Y1I USB Power Load Inducer and Tester]], I tested each of the ports and was able to maintain a 2.4 amp load on each port. I then left the load inducer on one port set at 2 amps while plugging in a Galaxy Note 3 and S5, both of which I know from experience to draw 1.65 amps when charging. I allowed this test to run for fifteen minutes and encountered no issues with the charger.<br /><br />To conclude, at the current price of $16.99 (at time of review) and Prime shipping, this is a decent buy. I reiterate that this charger will not fit everyone's needs, so make sure it will fit yours before ordering; but there's a good argument against spending extra money to get more charging capacity then you need.<br /><br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟"
-1,I bought this piece completely assembled to repair my smartphone and after several months had problems lighting and image. it was reviewed by an authorized htc agent and confirm that this piece was not new and was assembled from different parts (recycled) has no integrated lighting of the menu buttons they are at the bottom of the telephone circuit. the back of the screen that I bought has features of being detached from other phone and placed the digital touch him.
1,Nice and sturdy...
1,"its exceed my expectation, perfect material made of, quick charger for your electronic devices."
1,looks and feels nice. Phone has survived some minor drops so far
1,fits well and works well.
1,The case performs well in protecting my Lumia 640 xl. Haven't tried the belt holder as yet but I am satisfied  so far.
1,Great case.
1,This cover meets my needs and price range. It arrived well packaged and in good shape.
-1,Defective
1,"durable case, fits perfect on my LG G4. Design and colour is a plus, i love it. Its a flip cover that surely keep my phone safe. safe for bumps too and i can easily check my time on the circle window i found it amusing, elegant and unique design i ever got. I do have collections of case for my LG but this is the unique one, once i open the flip cover it automatically brights up and ask for my password. in terms of price it is not too bad. the last LG case i got cost me $6, i am willing to throw extra $4 if it is as good as this case.<br /><br />I received LG G$ circle case by Great shield for FREE in exchange of my unbiased and honest own opinion review."
1,Love love love. I get compliments on this wherever I go.
-1,This selfie stick does not work with the Galaxy S 6.
1,"Charges amazingly fast.Slightly heavy,but a small inconvenience for the power."
1,"This is a VERY nice setup for the price. The flexible arm is strong and stable, and the suction cup locks solid on a smooth surface. If I had any complaint at all, it would be that you only get 1 clip per pack. I bought 2 of them so I could have a couple clips. Using mine to hold a HTC M8 with a case, so it opens wide."
1,Very Good!!
-1,"case did not work, I went snorkeling with it and leaked a lot and now my phone is water damaged. I had to purchase a new iPhone 6 unfortunately."
1,"Awesome product, fast shipping, thanx alot!!!!!"
1,"This thing is awesome. It's robust, handles heat well, and charges your phone more efficiently than the manufacturer's cord (which, incidentally, for a phone that costs in the hundreds of dollars, its own cord is absolute garbage). My only regret is that I didn't buy the longer cord."
1,muy buen producto
1,Perfect
-1,did not receive the tool kit with it just led touch screen should get some money back for the incompetence thank you frank
1,As described. Fast shipping.
0,"From the onset when I was on the phone with someone, I was told I sounded distant and quiet, even with the mic right in front of my mouth and in a quiet room. I would not purchase again."
-1,"First choice out of all our headsets because they are small, lightweight, and swivel for either ear, but they break VERY easily. The pin that holds the ear piece together snaps off and they are rendered useless after only a few uses."
1,Where has this product been my entire life? It protects my phone from the worst abuse that I can throw at it. I've dropped a handgun on the screen by accident and it just bounced off (though I haven't tried SHOOTING the screen protector). Fits into my Incipio branded two-piece case too.<br /><br />Tip for applying the screen: take a couple strips of tape and tape one side of the screen protector to the phone (so you can lift it up like opening a book cover). Remove the film to expose the adhesive and &#34;close the book&#34; so there's a perfect fit.
1,"I have an Otterbox case on my phone, so my phone doesn't fit completely in the holder, but it still is able to hold it while driving.  As long as I'm not going off-roading ( which I'm never gonna do in this car) then it is OK.  It take a few extra moments to get it to sit just right.  Would probably really easy if I didn't have the case.  right now I'm using the vent clip version.  The suction cup window/dash mount looks really nice and looks like it would hold securely. It has a sticky ring to help adhere and I'm a bit concerned to put in on the dash of how completely it may or may not remove.  The heat in NC might bake it into the dash  :)"
1,Nice Charger. Works great.
-1,very disappointing when a &#34;factory unlocked&#34; phone won't work with verizon. how can they get away with saying factory unlocked when in fact it is not?
1,Everything is good except the headphone jack. I can't plug in an headphones with the case on. It's probably not the most  protective option but it's better than nothing and very cute. Love the pattern.
1,Great case that lets my iPhone color shine through.  It does get scratched and the bumper didn't come up high enough to protect the glass shield I had used for extra protection for the screen.  I removed the cracked class shield and the phone case has been working perfectly since then.
0,Its okay if you are looking for just a case. I wanted durability and something that protects the entire phone and this case didnt do that so i had to get another one.
0,okay
1,"After using it for a month, 2 of the 6 ports no longer charges. Without me contacting them, AnkerDirect customer support saw my review and wrote to me directly and advises me on how to reset the unit and resolve the problem. It turns out that the port isn't working properly because my device might has triggered the protective internal safety switch. In order to reset the switch, unplug all cables (including power cable) for five minutes and retry. the 2 &#34;bad&#34; ports work fine after that. I gave them a five star because Anker care about their reputation and the product has this build in protection and it works fine."
1,Exactly what it says it is. Great price. Shipping took a while but not too long and that is what's stated. Have ordered 2 from here and would again.
1,Love it
0,Tends to overheat.
1,works really well
-1,I give this cable a 1 star.  It's expensive and still does the same thing other cables do.  The Lightning head gets popped off.  I got this cable as a gift and feel bad they spent 25$ on it when the outcome was the same.
1,Like it a lot!
-1,"Until ANdroid can treat SD storage in a much more integrated way, the phone has a huge issue with being full all the time. Other than that a perfect budget phone. Just don't download any apps!"
1,"If you can spare the vent, this is likely the most easy and effective car mount mount you can get for the price."
1,"it works very well, the cord is long enough it fits on top of the dash board with the phone."
0,"Yesterday I really lost my keys.. I immediately looked at my app, and it showed me the location of the keys two days ago.. NOT HELPFUL!! I wondered why, as this almost makes Tile totally useless. Not sure if I should keep trusting this thing.. It did help me find my keys once when I couldn't find them anywhere in my apartment. That's why I'm giving it 3 starts//"
1,"Works great, good product"
1,Love it! It bends to fit if you are trying to get it into a tight space to charge your band. It works well- no complaints yet!
0,"What would make this nicer:<br />- A more versatile kickstand that allows for more upright angles and to sit the entire phone verticle for Facetime.<br />- Keep the outside rubber-like for grip, but get rid of the deep grooves that create a place for dirt, grime and germs to collect.<br />- Make a thicker bumper around the front to protect the phone better.<br />- Make closures for the ports so they don't get dirty.<br /><br />What is already nice:<br />- Grip/non-slip<br />- Lightweight<br />- Fairly low-profile<br />- Nothing covers the lens so the camera integrity isn't compromised.<br />- Feels protective<br />- Easy to put on and take off (easy for an adult, hard for a kid)"
-1,Case doesn't stay together.
-1,"I didn't work to expectations, it would connect  with SD cards whenever  it felt like, much less with USB connectors."
-1,Item was not what was advertised.  Not returning because it will cost me half what I paid plus 20% restocking fee to return it than the refund I would get.  Very cheaply made case with NO dedicated switch to turn it off/on.  No felt lining inside the case either.  I will be selling this and hopefully get what I paid out of it.  Read the product reviews and seller reviews before getting this.  I would not recommend this case.  Would not buy again.
0,This Cute lovely Bear Winnie the Pooh is only okay for me.The quality is not so much good because it looks cheap.I can understand because of how the material made because the price is low at cost.It is not rightly fit to my spouse Lg G2 cellphone but she love the design pretty cutie.
1,Also got this for my wife. Doesn't feel as protected but it's light.  We'll see what happens haha.
0,{{{{ Re-review 9-25-2015 Ooops! step count stopped counting. Returned to Amazon and replaced with garmin vivoactive -------- }}}}<br />I pre-ordered the pink and white small (I'm a 6'1&#34; 200# male. It fits!).<br />It synced to Garmin Connect on my PC and Connect Mobile on my iphone 6 no problem.<br />I bought this as an upgrade to my trusty vivofit 2. I have more information at a glance than the vivofit.<br />It is very lite and unobtrusive and looks good. Everything seems to be working well. Just as I expected.
1,We bought 2 of the LGG3 Glass protectors for 2 phones. The first one we rec last week on Friday went on great. No issues. Stuck well and looks good.Ordered a second one for a new phone rec on Monday. This one had issue getting it to stick. Something was different. Followed same procedure even though new phone with cleaning etc. Something different. Would have given 5 stars except for the sticking issue with the second one.
-1,doenst fit really good
0,"product is okay, not as nice as some of the elago iphone 5 cases that are really reinforced. when its off the phone feels a little weak, but when on the phone its a little better. quite a slippery case as well. very nice color and fit."
1,great one i like it
-1,It never works.
1,Great charger- was able to quickly charge smartphones and iPad and the flashlight came in handy as well.
1,This is great case to make a rugged manly phone look more girly. My only complaint is taking it on and off for use by the pool and with an armband to workout. The outside part of the case is very rigid and can be difficult to get into place. Instructions would have been nice so I know if I can use it in the water without risking mold and damage to the phone. My best guess is no because the material of the phone is made to repel water and the case could hold water in.
1,"The qi charger on this device is surprisingly quick. I use this for my note 5 before i head out to class and work. I use the qi charger when i have over 30 percent battery left because its much better for your battery life, not over charging it like you would when charging it directly. When you charge your phone using qi, the charging output drops when your phone reaches a certain percent. My phone charges from 50 percent to 100 in about 30 mins. Not a bad device at all. You could get about two to three full charge with it."
1,"Pink and bling, I love it!  Fits my phone perfectly, I've dropped it and it's been protected.  Came with a screen protector and pink stylus as well.  I'm happy with my sparkly cover, highly recommend!"
1,Excellent
1,Works very well. Workmanship is pretty good - but not excellent.  Well worth the price.
1,"I bought two of these thinking since they were pretty cheap I might need the other one pretty soon. I'm surprised the first one hasn't even stopped working yet! I'll have an extra in case I need it but for now I won't need it, and I got two for less than the price of one from Apple"
-1,Works ok - Bought a Dual USB adapter to put in the top (As the side usb ports are useless if you mount in the console). Would not power the adapter and ended up not being able to use the product for the trip as needed. Looks nice - very sleek and small.
0,"I purchased this to replace an older 9500 which after about 7-8 years froze up. Read the reviews and figured to give it a try for myself. While it looks like a 9500 it surely is not. Cheaper controls with a side on/off  volume wheel which feels very cheap and the volume is very low. Lots of false alerts and the range on radar detection is fair to ok. Tried it for a few days, but you do get what you pay for, so back it went for a new 9500. The almost double price for the 9500 is worth the cost for a better quality unit that can keep you out of trouble."
1,It works awesome. No other power backups cannot compete with this in terms of both cost and quality. I recommend buying this.
1,Thank you
0,"I ordered this wanting to try the new hardened glass screen protectors, and it had good reviews and was on sale. The packaging was what you'd expect to find in a retail store, but like others mentioned it had no instructions. It didn't worry me though since I've applied various screen protectors previously, but manufacturers differ and I'd like to see their &#34;official&#34; process (which is, indeed, in the photos above). Nonetheless, application was easy using the tools included with it, and I was able to get a bubble/dust free application. HOWEVER, given the stiffness of the glass protector, it fails to conform well to he very edge of the phone, leaving a slight gap/ raised edge (see pictures). For that reason I knocked off two stars, since in time I can imagine dirt slowly making its way and sticking under the edges, eventually causing the screen protector to fail."
1,"I bought the TomTom camera about a month ago, and am very impressed with it. I'm an experienced still photographer, but don't have much experience with video. I have done various time-lapse shots of storms, driving around, etc. and have gotten great results. I took it with me to Costa Rica a week ago, and being able to transfer files to my cell phone without use of a computer is a great feature while away from home.<br /><br />I *should* have bought the full package at first, but didn't realize that it didn't come with the underwater lens cover which is something I wanted. So, I ordered that separately from the UK and it was here when I returned from Costa Rica. I played with it in the pool once, and was very impressed with the clarity and lack of distortion. I look forward to doing some more underwater work with it."
1,"We now have a year on 3 of these.  They are all still flawless.  Very easy to put on and we don't notice any difference in touch sensitivity and color shift is so slight it's just not worth talking about.  They've shared space with small screwdrivers, sharp mechanical pencils, keys, high powered ecigs and all sorts of hostile items too numerous to mention.....yet not a scratch on any of 'em.  I actually bought some spares and it seems I probably wasted my money.  There is simply no reason to replace them and if it ain't broke don't fix it.  I've found that Charmin TP is absolutely the best cleaning material for this item...........don't know why, it just works.  Good job Noot and Amazon....thanks"
1,"Works great, and the length of it works perfectly for me!"
1,"I'll admit, I shower more now..."
1,"I haven't used this device very long but it is charging an IPad ,a Blackberry and 2 Android phones at the same time. Before it was a pain fitting all of these items on a power strip all together. It appears well made and the USB ports are nice and tight fitting."
0,Works Ok.  Wish it fit more secure but does the job.  A lot will depend on your car vent is as placement is critical.
1,Great item to allow you to connect your wireless blue tooth headphone to hook up to your tv
1,They fit perfectly for my two year old and she loves them.  I only took off a star because they are still a bit loud.
1,"It's very cheap. The sound produced by the headphones is surprisingly good. Fit is great - it's very comfortable, but it never falls off one's head."
1,Works just as well as the one it replaced. Let's hope it lasts longer.
1,"It works...for $25 that's all you can really expect.  First things first.  This is not nearly as user friendly as an ipod.  It, of course, doesn't sync to iTunes or any other music service.  What you have to do is convert any songs you have into mp3 and drag them into the device when connected to your computer.  If you have DRM protected music in your iTunes account, you're not going to be able to get it into this device.  Sound quality is very good (I can't tell the difference between this and an iPod).  The screen graphics are straight out of 1995 (again, it's $25).  Bottom line, though it works.  The battery life is decent and it meets my needs."
-1,Less than a week old and the charger unit is already broker. The plastic piece holding the charger pins broke loose.<br />Charger is basically a plastic P.O.S.<br /><br />Batteries worked OK for a couple of days. Now they cause my Note 2 to reboot. Back to my stock battery and phone is working fine.<br /><br />I can't return this P.O.S. fast enough!!!!
1,just the right size
1,Excellent !!
1,works perfect
1,"Fix perfectly! Maintained the phone's elegant! Got 2 of these for my mom and gf, they both loved it! =&#62; Man of the house = 5 STARS!!! Would buy again in different colors!"
1,"I haven't used it yet, but it feels extremely sticky to me and am hoping it won't leave a gummy mess on my dash."
1,Excellent holster for the iPhone 5. Very secure hook and loop closure.
1,"This is a great case, especially for the price. I consistently drop my phone and have had no issue with the case coming apart or breaking."
0,"Upon initial inspection of the Protech case, I liked it. However, if you have a tendency to let things slip from your grasp this case will certainly meet that need. The hard plastic protective shell casing will more than likely help prevent damage if you accidentally drop your iPhone, but you need to take special care when you grasp your iPhone as this case has slippery sides. The lip on the back of the case is deep enough to protect the camera lens, but the lip on the front might not be and I wouldn't recommend laying your iPhone front side down. All of the port openings are good for access except one - the mute button port is too deep and if you have larger than normal fingers you'll struggle a little flipping that switch (I have to use the fingernail on my pinky to operate the switch). The overall design of the case is sleek, minimal and attractive. This case would rate higher if not for the minor engineering flaws I mentioned.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review."
1,I love the vivo 1v its a good  Phone
-1,No one can here me talking unless I open the charger cover. Really hard to push buttons. Would not recommend.
1,Bought this case for my 16 yr old daughter & EVERYONE at her high school LOVES it
1,"Wow! That little thing is full of useful features, easy to set up, sounds great with an amazing rich deep base. A delight to listen to and operate. You can't go wrong with this. I use it on the bathroom sink and am confident it will survive a splash of water now and again!"
1,"This is lightning fast! I love the swivel head on the charger as well. Fast charger, fast shipping! Definitely recommend."
1,"Sturdy and easy to find. Protects phone , stand is really convenient !"
-1,Junk. Only worked for 1 week
-1,"It is a good case but it does have a lot of flaws. They put the speaker in the wrong place, so the actual speaker on the phone is not protected the phone case is really really hard to get on and you can't take it off with out breaking the case and the silencer on the side, there is no way of turning that on and one more thing that drives me crazy is that the plastic on the screen that covers it is really loose so if you want to type you have to push harder then normal to get the right letters in but other then that it's a good phone case."
1,I loveee Pokemon so much and so this case is amazing !!! The drawing does not peel off and it takes a while for it to scratch and to break it arrived on time and I just love it !! But one small thing is that it's a little loose but nothing really big to worry about but I recommend it !!!!
-1,"Stopped working 5 days after receipt.<br /><br />Motion sensors never worked, night time recording involves activating an LED light that blinds you if you're driving by producing a glare on your windshield, never really was happy with how it functioned even before it stopped working.<br /><br />Would return but opened electronics aren't eligible for returns, so I'm looking for a reliable dashcam that isn't ridiculously expensive again."
1,good material
1,Thank you
1,I got this product in the exchange of a review.<br /><br />It is pretty good and fitted well. I would recommend this for screen protector.
-1,It came to me broke like wtf
1,Flawless! I ran into some trouble with my original port that just didn't have a good connection. Ordered this back and a charging pad.  I admit I was nervous after reading some of these reviews. Charged it today right after it came in the mail. Flawless! What a relief! Worth the wait of shipping it from China so don't expect it until about 10 days. But so sweet!
1,"Given To Me For An Honest Review<br /><br />Sport Bluetooth Headphone, Aukey EP-B13...by Aukey have great sound quality when &#34;sealed&#34; correctly in the ear. The controls are easy to use.They are real convenient to carry as they automatically &#34;coil up&#34;  when taken off. Included in the packaging are:<br /><br />*  Aukey EP-B13 Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Stereo Headphones<br />* Instruction Manual<br />* Standard micro-USB charge cable<br />* Rubber ear nums of various sizes<br /><br />These are great to use while working out, jogging or just to listen to some great music.I love mine. These would make a great gift to give. We have 4 months until Christmas. You won't go wrong picking one up for yourself and a friend. I gave this item 5 stars but wish I could give it more because it deserves many more. I highly recommend this item to everyone."
1,The case was really classy with the finish and quality. Would have been great given the top of the phone is covered with the white frame too..It just looks like a bald head. But irrespective of that I loved the case very much. Would definitely suggest to a friend
1,It works!
1,Protects my iphone 6 from falls and my toddler! Great product
1,"Nice and small profile, provides a decent bit of grip. Not super protective, but seems to be holding up well 6 months later."
1,This works great and the strap is comfortable and holds on snug during any type of workout. I do think it is over priced considering the materials to make this isn't much.
1,I bought tHis for my wife and she loves it.
1,"Great product!  Very happy with this purchase.  Excellent for frequent travelers who need to share a AC outlet with a lamp etc plus also want to plug in your phone, ipad, Apple watch, external batter and toothbrush.  It works great!"
1,These are so cute and seem to work very well!  My granddaughters love them and I have fun with them too!
1,"Great fit for the original (non-AT&T) Passport. Good texture for gripping, and good dimensions to let you place the phone face down on a dusty table without the screen getting destroyed. Same for the camera on the back of the phone."
1,fits good.  makes the phone big and sticks to inside of pocket but it does protect the phone.
1,I love it great
-1,This is one of those products that you never feel too guilty buying because of the price but that being said it didn't last more than a couple of uses and i can't see this being the best option at any point or for any purpose
1,"I bought this phone from &#34;232Tech&#34;, they get 5 stars because the order was completed successfully and delivery was sooner than expected<br /><br />So far, the product meets the expectation... a simple Blackberry to keep Grandma in touch via Skype and WhatsApp."
-1,Although lots of people liked it. It did not work with me. I charged it and connected it to my iPhone 6. It worked first then stopped working the second day. Whatever I tried I wasn't able to turn it on anymore.
1,"exactly as expected, good for travel and extended use of navigation"
1,Love this case so far although I thought it came with a back not just a screen protector for the back of the phone.
1,"Cool little bit here. I wanted a line driver (a signal booster) for my low powered home stereo (ok fine it's a wimpy tube amp if you must know (see my other review)) to get more volume. It gave me a bit more before clipping, but enough to make a noticeable difference. But it got better. It allowed me to use its aux input to run my Iphone into it so I could have 2 inputs going into said stereo. But it got better. It also has sub outputs so I could hook up a sub with said stereo. But it got better. It has 2 outputs besides the sub so I could also run my (2) inputs into another (solid state) amp. All this and I haven't even touched the equalizer settings...and probably won't. Get a power adapter for home use (see my other review) and you've got a $70 home equalizer that is compact, maximizes your amp's capabilities, and acts as a dual input and dual output switch plus allows a sub hookup via RCA interconnect. It's almost like they designed this just for my foolish stereo setup. I do get a bit more hiss/noise with this on at high volumes noticeable with no tunes playing, thus minus one star...but if I can trace that to the RCAs I would say 5 stars. Knobs are hard to reach, especially the master volume, which I wish they had placed all the way on the left instead of one in (the sub is all the way left). Like I said, pretty cool bit for the dough."
1,Pouch fits the Galaxy S4 and seems to have room for S6 as well.  Construction is pretty good.  Definitely works better for smartphones that the 5.11 Tactical phone pouch.
1,great item
1,Excellent.
1,"Perfect smartphone. Bit large for first time users but once you get used to it, you can't look back. The QHD screen is a treat to the eyes. The icons and text look amazingly clear. Amoled screen makes it even better. The camera quality is great as well. The body of phone is very appealing, with metal edges. I bought two of them. One white 64gb and the 32gb blue. The new updated price of Nexus 6 is more apt. I bought the Nexus 6 64gb at the original price of 699$ which i now believe was overpriced for it.<br />Nexus always has an advantage of getting first updates from Google, that is always a plus."
1,"Works great, not much else to mention."
1,Sturdy and well made.  Great fun for parties.  A little difficult to turn the selfie stick off--you have to hold down the power button for a lot longer than you'd expect.  I wish the telescoping part was a bit longer.
-1,It sucked
1,Love it! This is my charging box for all my devices.
1,Love it. Great fit
-1,took less than a month to start coming apart
1,"Not sure if this will fit my 2000 Grand Prix gtp. It is a 1.5 din, but the air vents stick out about 1.5&#34; from the face of the current radio. Not sure if the screen will be able to open all the way?"
1,"Its a case, it works and protects - my kid has not broken his phone in spite of dropping it"
1,"Ringke products are good quality and I read a lot of reviews about the Slim. I was worried it might be too light to protect my S6 Edge Plus but it actually works. I accidentally dropped it out of my pocket outside but the way it fell and landed my phone was fine. I’d say if you want a case for good protection and keeps how your phone feels naturally, go for this Ringke Slim case."
-1,I purchased this in March 2015 and it only lasted until 8/30/15.
-1,I purchased this for semi shallow scuba dives less than 20' deep it does in fact keep the phone dry however you can't operate the phone while at depth I shure if it's the case or the phone
1,Very fast shipping and the case itself is great. Looks very expensive and fancy. Great price. Already received compliments on it!
1,"The plastic covering the camera slows down the camera's focus time, and the bit covering the heart rate monitor renders the monitor useless. You have to take the entire case off to use the heart rate monitor.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a fantastic case."
1,"Nice color, good grip. Not sure how much protection it adds, but it seems to be adding some protection at least even though it's rather thin."
-1,Wire popped out of the casing within 2 weeks.  Poor quality.
1,Husband uses this as a back up amp.  He loves it
1,Kool color for Kristie
1,I ordered this case for my 6 but didnt realize that i actually ordered for a 6plus. Its a great quality case which si why i will reorder it BUT the right size this time.
-1,"Bought this after my old headphones broke, WORST SOUND EVER! They arrived as I was going to the gym opened them there and paired them to my phone with no problem but the sound totally ruined my work out. It is awful, like if  you were listening from a cardboard box. Don't waste you money I ended up sending them back the next day."
-1,Fell apart in less than 30 Days. Left earphone broke off. Held by small piece of plastic. DO NOT BUY.
1,it's ok
1,Ok
1,Just an amazing deal for screen protectors.  Admittedly they're not super quality so they get scratched up pretty easily but they're so cheap that you can just put on a new one every few weeks/months and it still costs just about nothing.
1,Works great. Super charger
1,"This product has an overall sleek, clean and qualatative feel. The performance and amount is perfect on trips where you'll be up and roaming around. Got another person or two who needs to charge their device? As long as you have the corresponding cables three people can charge at the same time; One though would be charging at a slower speed. The charger can be a hefty one pound but stick this in a backpack and it'll help. With alot of charging power, the weight or portabilty doesnt bother me as much."
-1,"The screen protector seems alright. Mine didn't quite fit right, and because of that, when I put my protective case on, the screen protector's edges got messed up and now it looks kind of ugly."
1,This is a beautiful band. It is exactly like the Apple blue watchband and a lot less money. The quality is superb. Don't be afraid to order it at all. I am just so happy I did. It goes with everything and it was so easy to put on. I can't thank you enough. Diane Hebert
1,Great. can add pics from camera to computer.
1,I am still learning all the nuances of this watch but I really do like it.  I wanted an internet watch that looked like a watch but still connected me to my apps and this one is perfect and is priced reasonably.  I'm not a part of the iUniverse nor do I want to be so I was very pleased that I could get an Android watch that would meet my connectivity expectations.  I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone using the Android platform.
0,"worked for the phone, but not the ipad!"
1,Exactly what I was looking for.
-1,frayed immediately
-1,Received as promotion. I'm a bit disappointed because one review stated that iPhone 6 plus would fit with otter box on. It will go in but not easily and I don't intend on removing my case everyday to place in holder. If it were a half inch longer it would be perfect. Those of you without otter box will probably love the fit. Once I got the armband secure on my arm it was comfortable but it took some time to get the strap through the double slots and fastened; or maybe I don't have enough coordination. I used it during my workout and the band served its purpose so I will probably get some use out of it and may get used to strap difficulty over time. I will likely get more use out of this during power walks for the music and not use it during bootcamp.
1,great itim
1,Way more power than the original battery. 10/10 would buy again.
-1,stopped working
1,"Very excellent, i love it. The phone is perfectly design"
1,Haven't had any problems with it! Works just as well as the Apple charger. I like the convenient 3 pack and the feel of the wire--not sticky. :-)
1,It's really cool .
1,Sturdy for the Iphone and I have dropped it several times and no cracks or breakage.
1,excelente
1,"I would give 5 stars however if these obtain any kind of distance from my phone, the music or conversation either stops or breaks real bad."
1,Works very well but think twice about ordering as it only has two USB ports. Love that the prongs are retractable.
1,worked great great price
1,"I was skeptical, but this protector is like it's not even there.  Clear as can be.  I much prefer it to the previous invisible shields I have used in the past that were just the film as those seemed to dull the display a bit..this leaves the view crystal clear."
1,"I received my screen very quickly, even before it said it would be here! It was exactly what I needed and is working perfect!"
1,I just received my Kate Spade phone case and I love it! It looks exactly like the one in the picture and it is beautiful and looks and fits real nice on my phone! Very pleased!
1,I love this case! It's durable and stylish
1,I have an older Sony TV in my bedroom and this Bluetooth transmitter extends it's lifetime for a few more years. Thank you for such a great product and the follow up after sales.
1,"So, I admit to being a cell phone case junkie.  I probably have a dozen in my &#34;tech&#34; drawer for my iPhone 6 Plus.  But when I saw the Dreem case I was intrigued.  I waited several days of normal use to write my opinion and I can now safely say that this case really is a &#34;dream&#34;.  The folio is beautifully made and flexible enough to hold a variety of cards and cash.  Magnets work flawlessly and I feel very secure carrying this beautiful case with me everywhere.  But the icing on this cake is the second part of the case.  When necessary I can remove the phone from the folio and still have a beautiful and protective case on my phone.  The front lip protects my glass of my screen and the integrated magnets hold my phone securely on the iSwivel vent mount I have installed in my car.  I hit the jackpot!!<br /><br />I also forgot to mention another surprise I got when I received the Dreem Fibonacci case.  The packaging was so elegant I though I had received an Apple product.  Every detail was well thought out and elegant.  Their attention to detail from packaging to product makes this a go-to product."
1,"Perfect fit, went on easily. Instructions were good. All pluses in my book."
-1,The LifeProof case for iPhone 6 has poorly designed cover of the charger port. The charger cover will snap open too easily exposing the phone. It happened to me when I was kayaking and had the phone in my pocket just to find out later the case was leaking and my phone was dead. I used to have the Lifeproof case for the iPhone 5 and the design was much more robust.
0,"Works good for a one full charge, but battery and phone get very warm while charging. Even more warm if you are using it at the same time."
1,The case is beautiful.  Fit Right on my Moms phone with no problems and she loves it. I would so recommend this to my friends and family. One of the better cases I have bought (😊and I have a huge collection of cases).  I'm happy with this case.
1,i like it
1,"These little headphones pack a powerful sound punch. The sound is clear and crisp, just as it should be. These are comfortable in my ears. These headphones are just as described. They feel solid and are made very well! The audio quality is awesome."
1,It is beautiful and comfortable in use. I gifted the same (the black one) to my husband.
1,"Look real good , works as advertised , happy"
1,"I absolutely adore Anker's external battery chargers! I had an older version of this battery charger and was forced to upgrade since my previous Anker charger was stolen. Instead of trying out another brand, I already knew what I wanted to buy. :)"
1,I wish it could hold more cards without it getting so stiff. Also the magnet could be a little stronger. Aside from that I really love this wallet case! Saves me from carrying a huge bulky wallet in one pocket and my huge phone wit it's otterbox case in the other!
1,"I spent a lot of time searching Amazon and other dealers for a lightweight but effective case for my new Galaxy S5.  This product seemed to fit the bill and was not expensive, so I figured I'd give it a try.  It is indeed lightweight and it seems to protect the phone well.  Be aware that this product is ONLY for the Galaxy S5.  It won't fit any other phone.  It has cutouts for every place for which access is needed.  I did find that it was a bit difficult to open the cover on the USB port, but the case is so easy to remove when using that port.  I didn't find it to be a problem.  When the case is on the phone, it seems secure and protective.  When I didn't want it on, removing it was a cinch.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to test its durability, because I returned the phone.  If I had kept the phone, I'd be using this case now."
1,Love it! Ordering additional colors I liked it so much.
1,Its easy to carry my phone and money at the same time
1,Havent dropped it yet but for the price im surprised by the look and fit. Looks and feels more expensive. Hopefully it stands up to a good fall.
-1,Fell once out of my pocket and completely broke.
1,"I find this product awesome though I have some difficulty in activating the apps for the messages to work. But once I got the right apps everything went well and good. I even ordered 2 more for gifts. The voice command is great, the volume and the sound quality is perfect. Ever features is working good.  Its worth the money."
1,very good and fast shipping
1,Great product
-1,Received a shattered shatter proof screen...talk about irony
1,Thanks
-1,"I got a pair of these and I must say I totally regret it!  First of all these headphones seem a knock-off of the Air-Fi® Matrix2 AF62:  [[ASIN:B00DOP3NPW MEE audio Air-Fi Matrix2 Bluetooth Wireless + Wired High Fidelity Headphones with Headset and aptX, AAC, and NFC Support]]  I asked both company's staff about this. MEEaudio store staff alleged &#34;the Ausdom M05 are a knock-off of the Air-Fi® Matrix2 AF62&#34;. On the other hand, very later on Ausdom staff replied to me stating that they &#34;manufactured the Air-Fi® Matrix2 AF62 for Meelectronics&#34; (now MEEaudio). So definitely there is something weird going on here... MEEaudio is an electronics company established in City of Industry, California since 2005. Ausdom is a Chinese factory based in Southern China.  Ausdom M05 is a product that cannot be verified as genuine for which you'll pay pretty much the same as for getting a pair of original headphones. Imagine you buy something that is not mainstream but is not that cheap either, so it is not a big brand but at least you are happy to say it is an original product and not a knock-off of a known brand, but then you realize It is a non-genuine product... wouldn't you feel really disappointed?  Secondly if you are looking for a comfortable headset you better go look somewhere else since I am not being able to keep them on for more than 10 minutes. Even though my ears are quite small they feel unpleasantly tight and the earpads harm your ear cartilages. Comfort is a essential when talking about a headset.  With respect to the sound they are too bassy and voices are really really low as if they are distant. Also you will easily notice a high latency. I was concerned about aptx compatibility, since most devices with Bluetooth transmitters such as laptops or TVs do not support this technology yet, so I emailed them to enquire about compatible aptx dongles. Based on their replies they don't even seem to know their product. One of the things they told me in theircontradictory argument and in broken English is that there are no aptx devices whose Bluetooth version is less than 4.0, when clearly there are both transmitters and headphones with lower Bluetooth versions that support aptx. An examples of this is the Aukey Wireless Bluetooth Audio Transmitter BT-C3 with Bluetooth version 2.1:  [[ASIN:B00PI62YVO Aukey Wireless Bluetooth Audio Transmitter Portable Bluetooth Stereo Music Adapter Dongle with A2DP and aptX Low Latency Technology (BT-C1, Black)]]  So they haven't been able to recommend me an appropriate dongle to use the headphone's aptx feature.  The microphone is quite bad and you cannot configure it to work with the headset in &#34;headphones mode&#34;. It will rather work as a hands-free device and the quality of the audio decreases greatly. Not to mention that it's a nightmare to configure the mic on Windows.  Honestly if you are willing to spend this amount, there are better original headsets out there around this price. Hopefully I will not make the same mistake twice."
1,Love the slimness of it. Just enough to protect it from scratches.
1,They work great and came on time
1,"This case is even better than I thought it would be! It's a great price! The case is just like the picture and the color is beautiful. The case fits perfectly, the buttons are easy to press, and the two parts snap together nicely and makes it look like a one whole case. I don't think they will come apart unless you want to take the case off. They are snug together! Where the speaker and charger and headphone plug-ins are, the holes of the case are nicely carved around them all! Including the camera and flash and mute button. If you always have to take your case off to plug your phone to a big speaker (with an audio-in cable), with this case you don't have to! There is enough space to plug in with it! Same with chargers and headphones! As for protection, dropped my phone a few times and it is ok! This is a great buy, I do recommend this one!"
0,"These headphones are okay. The sound is great, but they do not work well for running or anything that requires a ton of movement. After a couple of months with my first pair, the bluetooth stopped working. Fortunately the company quickly sent me a replacement. I had the second pair for a few weeks before they fell out of my ear while jump roping and broke. I have not heard from the company since then.<br /><br />Pros: Good sound, good for weight lifting or low impact exercises, hands free<br /><br />Cons: Do not stay in your ear while running or jumping, easily breakable"
1,love it
1,I Love this case.
1,Great
1,Great protection for my new Iphone
-1,"At first I was really impressed by this screen protector. It goes on very smoothly and leaves no bubbles. However, after the fifth day my phone slipped off the couch and fell (about 1 foot) on the linoleum floor, and the screen cover shattered. Is it true that there's a lifetime warranty on the screen cover as some other people had posted?  I thought this was what the screen protectors are made for."
1,Excelent delivered before initial delivery date.<br />Works great
1,"Thin, sleek case that will fit in a small pocket. As pictured & described. Thank you!"
0,"I purchased this mainly for use on my iPad and it worked ok. I am coming from the Samsung Note series and there is really no stylus designed with the accuracy of the S-Pen. The point on the S-Pen is what makes it stand out. And while there are expensive stylus that try to mimic the experience they have failed in expectations of the writing experience.  I have also used the Bamboo stylus and companion app which was not even better than using these styli.<br /><br />Over they get the job done but if you are seeking precision, this is not the pen to do it."
1,"Fits perfect, looks great and protects my phone.  Gives you a good grip on your phone so that you don't drop it.<br /><br />Would highly recommend!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review."
1,"Big and Bulky, but this workhorse does the job.  When I travel, I want reliable and long-lasting, and this battery pack does the job.  The two different ports boast different speeds to charge at.  1.5v charges on a regular time frame.  the 2.1v charges like it's on steroids.  It's not discreet, it's not light-weight, but effective!"
1,Worth having this product.
1,Otterbox perfection!
1,my wife loves her case
1,Love it
0,"Nice case, however, it gets dirty fast and the edges broke off when I dropped it. Its very cheap quality."
1,Product was perfect for what I needed it for. It protects my phone and is easy to get to. The product was exactly what was listed on the Amazon site and Wydan was quick on their response to get it shipped. Two days and I had it! Thanks!
1,"This screen protector made all the difference in the world regarding using my Galaxy S4.  I put in on myself in about 15 seconds.  No problem and it went on as smooth as silk.  No bubbles.  When I use the swipe method for emails and texts, my finger just glides along the screen.  No friction at all.  So much better than my plastic screen protector.  This item is a bargain.  Love it!"
1,Works great for my android phone (galaxy s5). Full mirror screen projection to my big screen tv.
-1,"I've been using it for a week and it slowly stopped tracking my sleep each night, now is not tracking it at all. It seems to track steps pretty accurately for me but definitely not sleep. I will be contacting the company but from other reviews it sounds like they aren't very helpful."
1,I have purchased these before. They work great and have saved my phone many times from scratches. Does the job and is easy to apply.
1,Great case :)
0,"I'm usually pretty happy with life proof but I noticed the other day that the protective area over the flash is broken? I don't know how long it's been like this, but disappointed ."
-1,I can not get it to stream right. It is so annoying. I am shipping mine back. Maybe cheap but doesnt work.
1,Works great.  Just what I needed and shipping was fast
0,Durable but my wife complains about the color fading fast.  The kick stand was difficult to pull out and resulted in her breaking it within the first day
1,"Wireless is great!  Good range for indoors. Battery life is just a few hours, so plan on recharging often (not a deal- breaker).  Stays in ear pretty good; would have been nice to have a few more loop sizes."
1,Excellent Thank You..
1,The item works fine but is a little bulkier than I expected.
1,"It came faster than expected and was a great product, but I realized it was for 2nd gen and I have 1st gen, and they were very understandingand helpful."
-1,The screen broke within the first two weeks.
1,Works well. Delivered promptly.<br />Satisfied with product.
1,Case broke within a month
-1,"This item does not fit the Blu Studio Energy, it is a tad too large. Also does not have the cutout as shown in the picture.<br /><br />go with this one instead.<br /> [[ASIN:B00SWS27Z8 VSTN ® Blu Studio Energy Glass Screen protector - Ultra-thin 9H Hardness 2.5D Round Edge Highest Quality HD clear Anti-Scratch/ Shatterproof / Anti-Fingerprint/ Water Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Blu Studio Energy smartphone]]"
1,Excellent product for my new iPhone 6! Feels very protective and sturdy!
1,Beautiful case! Love it!
1,"Exactly as advertised, quick delivery"
-1,"I received the samsung s4 , charged it,  but when I turned it on it powered down by itself and the volume turned off and on.  I couldn't use it at all so I returned it.  Was very unhappy with this purchase."
-1,I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 &  I ordered this battery for it but it did not fit my phone.<br />Very unhappy.
-1,"For the price, these were good length cables. However, they were fairly finicky when it came to staying plugged in and charging. Movement of the attached device could easily stop the charge, and one of the three completely stopped working after about 2 weeks. One works fairly consistently, and the third will only work if the device is completely stationary. Would not buy again."
1,Great for keeping track of my problem fleet drivers.
1,"I ordered these cables because I am constantly replacing my wife and kid's cables. These cables are standard length and the fittings on each end are molded on and have a firm strong feel to them. The cables are a nice rubbery feel to them. They don't tangle easily.<br /><br />I saw some reviews where there are claims the cable is slower to charge a phone or tablet. I did some testing and found that the amps are just slightly less than the stock cable that comes with an iPhone. I see the difference is not that much. The cables registered about .1 amp lower than the stock cable. Based on the results, the cable charge speed will be very close to the stock cable.<br /><br />I received a discount for my honest review. I am grateful to be given the opportunity to review these cables. I find that they are more than adequate for my needs and they do as advertised."
1,Great for charging up the phone when on the road...
1,I love it. My phone keeps running out of battery and this is the only thing that keeps it alive!
1,Excellent cable by Apple. Fits iPhone 5 or beyond
1,works fine i have dropped it from about 30 feet and without the cover my glass would have cracked but with the cover on it it made a mark on the cover but not the glass.
1,Great product. . Great sound quality. I can hear text and and respond to it with my headphones as well as take calls which comes in handy when I'm at the gym. Little snug at first on the ears but it's good now. Great battery life. Highly recommend
1,The phone was very good but I returned it. The screen came slightly damaged. May have been a factory defect. But the return was possible and everything was good.
-1,"Are you kidding...why did someone recommend this...used Waze on the 600 mile trip home to DC from Maine.  Kept accurate reading of traffic conditions all the way..  Not once did this cord combined with the Garmin give accurate or any information on traffic jams or conditions.  On the way up to Maine I used a Garmin and cord, &#34;suggested alternate route&#34; and when I started to use it, it took me back to the original route.  What was that about?  In my estimation both products leave a tremendous amount to be desired.  Extremely disappointed...The cost is ab surd for something that seems only to give some semblance of a map route..period...a total waste of money."
1,"I upgraded from a 4S to a gold iPhone 6, and I wanted a case that was protective, slender and still allow me to admire the beauty of the iPhone 6. I was skeptical at first because I usually go for an Otter Commuter case. I provided a total of 6 photos from all angles of the case. I love the ease and smooth feel of using the up/down volume buttons and on/off/hold button on the opposite side. All the other port openings are perfectly sized. I also like the thickness of the clear bumpers around the edges of the phone. There is a lip around the bumper of the phone so face of the phone is not flush with a surface when the phone is put face down. I have a tempered glass screen protector and it will not touch the surface when put face down. There is also a smaller lip on the back around the bumper. I love the clear back and how it shows off the phone. I may buy a second one in another color to change it up the look."
1,"Easiest screen protector installation yet. Fit is good, however the glass does cover the camera lens. It seems to have no effect on the camera though. Feels like the phone's original glass, and so far seems more resistant to finger prints."
-1,Doesn't fit the phone. doesn't stick when cut to size.
1,Works perfect.
1,The bracket is not good.
1,Nice
-1,Definitely not scratch resistant. Anything resistant for that matter. Dropped the phone about twice and ended up having the entire side of the phone cracked.
1,Good case.  I like the design.  The kickstand squeaks.
-1,I would highly recommend ordering from a different company. This product will not last longer than three months; suspiciously longer that the return policy.
1,"LOVE this wallet. Yeah, it got stolen due to my lack of attention, but when I had it it was great. It is a little bulkey, but personally, I like that. :D"
1,"Works fine but takes time for me to wiggle it around in order for it to connect correctly. If it shifts from a certain position, it doesn't connect.  Not sure if it's my car or the Scosche itself."
1,Perfect!
1,This was a good product for the price; however within days the black rubber was ripped from normal use.
1,Works well and charges quickly!
-1,Not good product not very durable pops off phone too easy when phone is dropped
-1,The first Nexus 6 I got had a cracked display.  The replacement I have had for two weeks and a couple rows in the display are &#34;dead&#34;.  Very distracting... doesn't got away with reboot.<br /><br />Has this fabrication issue been fixed?  Not sure if I should return or replace...
1,Great nDeal. Runs a little slower with 2 sims active
1,"Works fine, price was great.  Delivered on time."
1,"looks great, only slight problem is a few times the detectors actually slides off the holder."
-1,Had this for 2 weeks and its not charging my phone anymore
1,Excellent product!  Fast delivery!
1,It charges just as fast as the OEM Samsung Fast Charger for my Note 4 and the prongs are positioned so they don't take up more than one socket on my surge protector.
1,Work as intended.<br />I love it feels great.<br />Thank you.
1,Far better than any other screen protector. Doesn't yellow or dent ..very durable ..full coverage ..exactly like item description.
1,perfecto
-1,Poor quality!!!!! Very difficult to use clip holder still have not been able to use. The case for the phone is durable. The stand is a good thing but it only sit horizontally. The stylus tip fell off after a few uses.
1,This was a great case. Received in a timely manner in condition described. Happy with the quality of the product.
1,"I ordered this on the 19th, and the estimated arrival date was September 14th-30th.<br />It came almost a month early.<br />(TODAY.)<br /><br />I got a white and yellow one, and it fits my iPod with its fat, bulky, silicone case.<br />I needed to use a TEENSY bit of force to get it in there, but its perfectly fine.<br /><br />If I had to order it again, I would."
1,Great price! Works exactly it said.
0,My daughter likes it.
1,Going from a substantial &#34;defense&#34; case to this ballistic case is welcomed.. My previous case put quite a bit of bulk and as nice as it was it was too much.. This case on the other gives me the same warm feeling that my phone is more than okay yet keeps it on the lighter side. Along with the rubber covers over the aux and power port make it even better..
-1,"The product seems to work as advertised.  The red dot in the magnet is rubber and provides friction on the smooth ball bearing when it sticks, that's how your phone stays in place.  The magnet stuck to the back of my phone very well but the ball bearing mount did not stick to the dash of my truck.  I have a Tundra and the dash surface is a bit rough so the 3m sticky pad provided with the purchase didn't stick.  After the first one didn't stick I tried a second sticky pad and it stuck for maybe 15 minutes.  I'm currently working with the manufacturer to come up with a solution. If you have a 'somewhat' smooth dash this product would work great."
1,"Great tool to replace one lost in fire. Though reconditioned, like new. Thanks!! Delivered as promised."
1,"The dual 4.8A car charger has been a lifesaver time after time. I don’t know how many car charger adapters I went through but I am glade that the past is past. This little thing is power because it can charge my iPhone quicker than any other car charger I have ever tried.<br /><br />I love the fact that it is dual port instead of one. Having 2 adults in the car make it hard to charge two devices simultaneously. Now my husband and I don’t have to work for each other to charge our phone.  The blue LED indicator is nice to help me identified that I have power going through my charger. Some car charger don’t have that feature and if it does- the blue light is too bright. I didn’t have any issue with the indicator light whatsoever.<br /><br />You can also tell that woopower make good product like this car charger, because they take pride in ensuring that they build a great product. With customer in mind, they had added the circuit protection, protecting over-current, short-circuit, over charge and over temperature. The company also included a 12-month warranty of the car charger. This is a great company that produces great product.<br /><br />*Received this product at a discounted price for an exchange for an honest review."
1,Love it...does exactly what it's supposed to do.
-1,Only works for one charge and only charges for about 30 minutes before it gets hot to the touch and shuts itself off.. Invest some money into a name brand one. This is what I get for being cheap. -_-
1,Works well!  A little smaller than the actual screen. It looks nice though.
1,So far the quality has been great. I've had it less than a month so we will have to see what
1,Works great!
0,"great case.... rugged, belt clip is very sturdy and after dropping the phone a few time, there has been ZERO damage.<br /><br />FOLLOWUP 1/2016 --- Ok so I have just purchased this case for the 3rd time. (June 2015, Nov 2015 and Jan 2015.  I have also lowered my review score for reasons as follows:<br />I still think that this is a really good case.  I still feel that the belt clip is still very sturdy as well.  My problem as been that the small clip that holds the phone on the holster as broken off twice already.  I havent put excessive force onto it when it has broken.  Both times, it has broken while I was sitting.  Im not sure what the problem is, but if they sold the holster separately, or even made that clip out of metal, maybe it would last longer.  I am attaching a photo of the broken holster clip.  Otherwise a great case."
1,My son loves his new case. Its a good case and will help protect his phone!
1,Flawless delivery<br />Well made and sleek<br />I love the way it snaps in place<br />I'm ordering a few more
-1,I did not like this at all. Very bad. It seemed to be a case not just stickers also there are no holes where needed for camera area
1,The product looks sharp and works well.
1,"It works fine..but it has a lanyard, and nowhere on the instructions does it tell you how to or where to hook it..."
1,"Very snug on phone which is perfect. There is no gapping which I have had issues with in the past. Very cute design. The stylus did have a small dent in it, however I think that was due to the postal service not being careful. Great purchase overall."
-1,I purchased this battery through a daily deal. It seemed like a nice hefty battery pack and the digital display was a handy feature. Unfortunately after only 5 charge cycles the pack will no longer accept a charge. Too late to return to Amazon but I could pursue the 1 year warranty from Maxboost. Obviously it might not even be feasible to ship it back and forth.
1,"Time is an essential thing bc people have places to be at certain times. But what if you also had a reliable smart watch at your side? The opportunities could be limitless, you could call people through the watch on your wrist, late to go meet someone? Call them through your watch and tell them you'll be late. It'll all be possible if you own this watch, which in my opinion is an amazing product that can help anybody."
1,Exactly what I was looking for. Seller was great! Thank you!
-1,"I played with the phone for a couple of hours after we go it activated on the carrier.  It kept showing the Eastern time zone and would not change the date format per the system settings.  After adding the Google account, it would not update the contacts or calendar.  Finally, it kept giving me an error when I tried to update the software.  For a few dollars more, you can get one of the other Dash line like &#34;C Music&#34; which I had no trouble with."
-1,Was not cut right and was not happy at all. I threw them away because there was no need for them.
1,cool colors and patterns - it's fun to mix and match outifts
0,"Okay, but they drop out alot."
1,Very good quality
-1,"I'm a little disappointed, you have an annoying noise as if a loose cable on the left side, the sound is not expected"
1,Good solid case
-1,Product stinks only worked for a short time
0,the kick stand broke :(
1,Great protection at a great price.
1,Worth
1,Great replacement part with perfect fit and color match. Repair done by gluing (with LOCA) the replacement glass back onto the LCD results in a strong result that looks and acts like new. Great product.
1,"It works well, charging my i-phone 6 perfectly. I like its design and  gold color, too."
-1,junk
1,"Setting not selectable, takes too long to cycle through each information line. Maybe I'm just impatient"
-1,"Did not work after only 20 days...and like most people, did not want to go through the trouble of returning it."
-1,It doesn't  fit  the  phone.
1,great protection and not overly bulky.
1,Absolutely amazing. I got mine and its actually smaller then i had though which is awesome and charges my phone fairly quickly. Also came already half charged which was nice
1,Great Quality
1,Great product
-1,2 of them did not work
1,"No the greatest phone, better than iPhone 4 for under 100 and how cool the phone looks, great deal."
-1,Did not work on my IPhone 6 so I basically waisted my money. But only rated it 1star for this reason only.
-1,This did not fit my iphone 5.  the phone pops out of the hard shell.  I wouldn't buy this again
1,Love this case and I order 2 more. Nice design .Perfect fit. Very good price.
1,nice and sparkly
1,works great

1,"Another quality product from Anker! Simple, well designed, packaging and product. Charges all of my devices at full speed. I suspect it could even power my house in a pinch. Some people are stocking up on weapons for the apocalypse; I'm going to stock up on batteries and chargers :)"
0,"Purchased the waterproof case for a trip to Hawaii. I tested it out with tissue paper in shallow water. I was a little nervous taking it in deep water, but it was fine. I took it snorkeling but the plastic cover makes it hard to sometimes see how your pictures are coming out. Regardless, I was happy with the purchase. It kept my phone dry and allowed me to take some decent pictures for what it was. Not sure I would take it diving or anything crazy, but like I said, it did the job for the light stuff."
1,"In June we bought our KDLinks X1 Full-HD camera and we are so happy with it. Very good image quality, easily to set it up and to use. The mounting unit, windshield suction cup, is really great very easy to mount. We are ordering the second unit."
1,EXCELLENT!!!!!  The price was AMAZING.  I have already recommended this phone to friends and family.  Thank YOU.
1,"Small-ish capacity, but charges my phone at least 2-3 times fully. Love the built in cable and charger. This goes in my bag everywhere with me"
1,Wonderfull.
0,Broke the first month we had it

1,Great product.
1,Great quality! Got these for my 8 year old for her YouTube videos and there's lots of room to grow.
1,"I have owned many HooToo and RAVPower products and when I came around to needing a multi-port USB 3.0 Hub, I saw the HooToo HT-UH010 model and was very interested so I picked one up.  I couldn't be happier with my decision, as this hub is awesome!  It has 7 USB 3.0 ports which you can use for any device, such as USB Flash Drives, Portable or Desktop Hard Drives, etc.  On top of that, it has 2 additional ports which can charge any smartphone or tablet (1 port is 1A and 1 port is up to 2.1A).  This is something you don't see on a lot of hubs... only the more expensive ones.  The reason it's nice is because you can save space on your desk since your hub can act a desktop charger too for a tablet and/or smartphone.  I often find myself charging my phone while having other data devices connected in the other USB 3.0 ports.  Aside from that, the construction of the hub itself is very solid for being made of plastic.  The ports have adequate spacing, LED indicators, and it uses the industry standard VIA Labs VL812 chipset inside.  I highly recommend this product and actually am considering buying yet another HooToo product... their USB 3.0 Docking Station for my laptop.  :-)"
1,Beautiful!
1,"Having the right amount of battery power is a constant essential for video shoots but with various camera, monitor and lighting systems it's sometimes best to bring a power solution that can work across multiple devices. The Kayo Maxtar 12V is a portable and powerful battery that's a great addition for your shooting kit.<br /><br />The Kayo Maxtar 12V comes in a compact, hardshell zipper carrying case and has a rectangular design with a red and black colorway and glossy plastic finish. It's lightweight with a minimalist feel. Although the Maxtar is meant to be stationary, it would have been great to have a 1/4-20 thread to mount it on to a small tripod or shoulder rig.<br /><br />On the top is a high powered LED light which has 3 modes (flash, strobe and SOS) which lasts over 120 hours. While it's not a crucial feature, it's nice to have a flashlight handy during a night shoot.<br /><br />A closer look at the accessories reveal a power charger, car charger, jumper cables, and various power connectors. One caveat is that the power cord for the connectors is short which means any device that you are powering must be stationed very close to the Maxtar.<br /><br />Nothing can ruin a good shoot than backup battery power that can't keep up with your usage. Thankfully, the Kayo Maxtar 12V is capable of multiple charges. It's high capacity cells can fully charge an iPhone 6 at least 4 times, a Samsung S5 about 3 times, an HTC One about 3 times and a Mini iPad about 2 times.<br /><br />The dual 20V 3.5A and 12V 2.5A is also a nice touch which is ideal for powering up small devices like an LED light or external monitor. Again, it would have been nice if there was a mounting solution for the Maxtar but some industrial velcro straps or zip ties should do the trick.<br /><br />Another interesting feature are the included 12V jumper cables to jump start your vehicle. While I didn't have an opportunity to test this out, it's a nice addition and much more convenient way to jump start your car instead using another vehicle.<br /><br />Overall, the Kayo Maxtar 12V is a highly affordable power bank that runs much cheaper than some other Li-Ion solutions on the market. Having this in my kit assures that I'll have power available if anything goes wrong - like an uncharged battery - which happens sometimes. Sure it's not immediately adaptable for video rigs but with some DIY techniques, it's a much cheaper alternative than standard V-Mount style batteries. The Kayo Maxtar 12V is definitely worth considering if you're looking to have an all in one battery backup solution for any situation."
1,"After going through a few waterproof cameras that were pretty pricey, & didn't even take pictures that were very clear I decided to give this option a go. I figured at less than $15 this would be a great  deal if it worked & if not then I would definitely be sending it back.<br />Well....This waterproof pouch is truly AMAZING!!! I was VERY skeptical & did not get my hopes up too high (especially because of the low price), but after testing as instructed I was confident that my iPhone would be safe. My iPhone 5S has an Otterbox on it & fits perfectly inside with room to spare. I could even place our seasons passes for our local water park & our USB (for transferring purchased pics. at the water park) inside with my phone.<br />The instructions said to put a piece of paper towel inside, close, & submerge in a sink full of water for an hour or more. I actually filled a large bowel with water, sat that in the sink, opened my pouch, inserted dry paper towel inside, closed it as instructed, placed it in the bowl & then placed a smaller bowl full of water on top so it wouldn't float up, & left it for several hours. Sure enough when opened later that day the paper towel was completely dry.<br />I will admit ... even after the initial test I was still a little worried, so I didn't use it underwater on our first visit to the water park. BUT I have now used this pouch 4 times (once a week) at our local water park, testing it out each time before going, & felt safe enough to finally use it underwater repeatedly. We took several underwater pics. & video yesterday while enjoying the water, & all of them came out splendidly without any issues whatsoever. I would recommend always testing your pouch before using it for your phone (as instructed) since cellphones are not cheap. Honestly, I was quite shocked at how clear the video came out! The still pictures did not come out quite as clear, but they are still better than the last underwater camera I purchased (& I'm positive that has more to do with my camera more than this pouch anyway.) I have no complaints whatsoever.<br />The length of of the lanyard is nice as it hangs at chest level, & if you like it shorter you can always loop it at the back to shorten it as you would any other lanyard. It's light weight, crystal clear, & at this point we have not had any issues with condensation or anything else even in the HOT Texas heat. I highly recommend this pouch. In fact I'm thinking I may buy an extra just to have when/if I ever have issues with this one.<br />I have included a few pictures so you can see how clear the pictures really are. I love that we can even see all of the little bubbles & movement in the water as my daughter jumped into the water off of her Daddy's shoulders!more to do with my camera more than this pouch anyway.)

1,This Glass protector is everything I wanted. Easy to install. Just follow the directions. I think they have a Youtube video on how to apply​ the Glass.
1,Really nice &#34;selfie stick&#34;  No more having to keep your &#34;stick&#34; charged and running out of juice in the middle of the day.  This stick (I bought the all black version) is well made and put together with care.
1,Excellent
1,"Pretty, but flimsy."
1,"This was a great purchase. I used this on vacation in Italy with a European power adapter. I was charging two devices every night, one time 3 (all Apple products). No issues with charge time; no issues with heat on the charger. Plugged it in, went to bed, woke up to 100% charge."
1,it works great!
1,havent used it yet.  but appears to be well made and durable.
-1,"This product does not work. Don't waste your money & time. Don't believe the positive reviews written on this product, as it is completely false. Amazon should remove such products from it's site."
1,Made it to me sooner than I expected and I'm pleased with it.
-1,"If u need a better one,  don't go for this"
1,"I bought this USB cable because I needed to be able to distinguish it from all the other USB  cords that I have, and it certainly does that.  It  works really well, arrived on time and packaged well. All in all,  I'm well please."
-1,"My daughter does not like it, I want to return it but don't have the receipt. I lost it somehow. Anyway I can return it without a receipt??"
1,"I always go outside at night and although I have lights around the house there is one corner which we fail to install a light fixture. I've been thinking about get a motion sensor light for a while, so when I received this Solar motion sensor light free of charge to test it and share my honest opinion, it was heaven sent. This is a compact light, but don't be fooled by its size because it does brighten when on! It has 4 LED lights and it is solar charged, therefor you only job is to install it where you desire and just enjoy it! The seller is nice to send you a set of screws and mollies and a hook pin with it. Works great  and I am thinking I need to order a few more for my trees towards the end of the property where my dogs cruise at night. Great MPOW product as usual."
-1,The metal back on it interferes with the signal!! :(
-1,"didn't hold a charge from day one ,waist of time and money!"
1,Simple and can't beat its price. Been using it for two weeks and no complaints.
1,Made a great gift.
1,"Works great, super convenient all for a cheap price! Just wish I would have gotten black color instead of tan as tan shows the dirt."
1,Love the case.  Suction cup came out but still stays closed so that's fine.  Strange almost undetectable magnet or something inside lower flap door where credit card goes.  Not sure why it's there... but case does the job nicely.
1,I purchased this for my grandson's phone. He loves it. Very sturdy and protects the phone.
1,Great case. Great protection. Would buy again.
-1,"Love the concept, but it fell apart within 2 months.  The stripping along the edges started pealing off.  The cover for the card insert came apart so now the cards fall out."
1,does this phone have a place for a sd card
-1,only worked 2 weeks
0,"Scratched very easily, had to replace it within a month. The privacy screen was nice though."
1,Must have if you are among those who have forgotten license or credit acrd at home and have started driving with just phone in hand
1,Good product. Fast delivery
0,"This case is great if you are planning to use the belt clip. I purchased it hoping that I could remove the belt clip at times and just use the case, but this is not an option with this case. I only kept it because the return shipping was to high."
1,Great seler
1,Thank you
1,Delivered as promised - works great.
1,The case protects my phone well and I have dropped it like 6 times and it looks in great condition. And plus is the ports ar protected. It comes with a screen protector which is super easy to install if you are unsure just look at YouTube videos on how to place it without any bubbles. The only con is the ports get dusty. And I don't like that the apple symbol is exposed like it's not really necessary.
1,Love it
0,not as good at the IPhone 5 glass as the black is not stuck to the phone just kind of floats.
0,"It's an ok case. But Ballistic apparently doesn't make a case for the 5c that is good as the ones the make for other iPhones; the Hard Core. At least if they do, Amazon doesn't seem to carry it. Too bad. The Hard Core is a great case."
-1,"The &#34;genuine&#34; Apple OEM charger is not an Apple charger.  It worked the first day, but charged very slowly.  Now when I try to charge you get this message that it can't be charged."
1,It works great. Just wish that maybe there were air vents for the summer. Sweaty
1,this is genuine genius.
1,"Update 9/19/2015: I received another power supply sent by Anker's customer support. It has been working great for more than a week now. They are concerned about keeping their customers happy.<br /><br />Update 9/3/15: Company has contact me to get faulty unit swapped out - will post updates...<br /><br />Original review: Started out fine, did great duty on my trip to Kenya in December. A few weeks after returning to the U.S., a port died, leaving the connected device with a dead battery. Now, two more ports have died, leaving only two working. Not worth the effort to return, just to get another that will die the same way (read other reviews). Ports die, do not buy"
1,It is great!!
1,"I purchased this as a gift for my mom. She's used it every day for a few months and loves it. There is enough space for cash, a drivers licence and maybe 2 more cards. She doesn't normally pay with credit or debit cards so that works fine for her. If you have lots of cards this might not be for you. It fits the phone well and she doesn't find it hard to use with the case on. The included stylus is ok, she doesn't use it. I think this case is a great value! Locally these same cases are sold for twice or three times what you pay here on Amazon. So don't think that you always get what you pay for because at your mall you might be paying more for the same stuff."
1,Works great
-1,"Poor quality - lucky you get three, pretty difficult to install - first time I installed it I was trying to fix a bubble and it broke.  The second one was fine, but after a while it was scratched very easily.  The corners started bubbling up so I bought an ArmorShield - don't bother with these."
-1,not happy
1,"I received this product at a discount in return for an unbiased review of the product. I was so excited to receive this speaker, I alway enjoy listening to music while in the shower, but it's hard to hear when the speaker is outside the shower. And the shower radio I had does always pick up well. With the Bluetooth shower speaker you can listen to what you want to listen to. And with the speaker being in the shower you do not have to turn it up so loud everyone in the house has to listen to it. I also used this in my hot tub, we could listen to music without the fear of getting our phones wet and it worked amazingly. The sound is awesome too, to be a small speaker it has a great sound. I was very impressed with this product. I highly recommend it!"
1,"I purchased one of these along with an Anker 10000MH battery pack specifically for a trip off the grid in a tipi.  I smoke an ecig with lots of batteries that needed charging.  I've also got an obvious cell phone.  The solar panel is great.  It opens up to catch as much sun as possible.  Even in the shade (which I was most of the time) it was still able to charge a battery and cell.  My car charging ports were all taken by my gf's stuff so I had to rely on my charger.  I used the solar charger in the back of my car while driving to place to place in full sun.  Even if it wasn't getting full sun in the back of my car, it would still charge.  The Anker 10000 MH battery pack takes about 16 hours to charge from dead to full plugged into an outlet.  I wasn't able to ever get it fully charged with only 4-6 hours of off/on sunlight but it worked.  Again, the tipi we stayed in was surrounded by trees.  We were in complete shade, yet it still charged for the most part.  It is rugged, although the grommets could have been placed in a slightly different arrangement to allow a user to hang it a bit better.  The little pouch kinda gets in the way...or if it was flipped 180 degrees, you would hang it while holding your stuff.  Overall, I was very pleased.  Went all weekend at a place with no electricity yet still used my cell phone and ecig anytime I needed.  Great product."
1,"Really cute case and it fits my phone perfectly.  Probably not the most protective case I could have bought, but it has stood up to a few minor drops."
1,"I have an old iphone 3gs that i plan to use it permanently as an ipod touch, in my mini cooper conv 2009.That particular<br />cable is the only one that makes my phone appears as an ipod at the central screen.It allows navigation through lists ,albums, artists<br />etc.Of course ,due to limitations of my mini's audio, this is quite an awkward way to explore ipod.<br />All in all, the cable does the job as expected. In comparison , several other adaptors for 3gs or 4, even for 5 or 6 iphones, they just pass the signal to aux ."
1,Perfect fit and good protection for the EasyAcc Classic 10000mAh Power Bank.
1,Great product fast shipping
1,The magnetic clasp fell off in less than 24 hours of use. Super glued it back on. Been great ever since.
1,"Purchased as replacement for a cracked case, perfect fit, and nice to swap colors occasionally."
1,"Love it, does exactly what I need it to do and that is keep me hands free while enjoying my music in the gym! Lightweight, can barely tell I am even wearing it! Definitely recommend this product."
1,"All fine, easy to apply, i did in couple of minutes."
1,Love them. Such a convenient devise for iPhone and iPad when making notes elsewhere!!
1,arrived quickly- very satisfied
1,The colors are great but the side buttons require some effort to push.
1,good for price
1,Love this case it protects and organizes as well as looks awesome!!
1,Great addition to a techie family car!  Works GREAT for the whole family.
1,Love it
1,Not too thick like you would expect! Easy to carry around the cable and the case is super protective. I received a discount on my order for a fair review.
-1,Junk!!
1,This one DOES charge an UP 1st gen
-1,Disappointed. Making due but doesn't really fit my vent. My phone flops down.
1,"We have several avid bikers in the family and all of them have used the clamp-and-cradle type phone holders that  mount on the handlebar and keep your phone where you can see it at all times.  They're handy, but what do you do if it rains?<br /><br />We live in an area with high annual rainfall.  Particularly in some seasons and particularly if you're riding in the mountains, a day-long ride is very likely to include some rain.  You can take your phone out of the phone holder and put it in your backpack or waist pack, but that kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?<br /><br />This innovative holder has a universal adjustable clamp that attaches easily to any bike.  Once it's in place. you can rotate the holder so that your phone is horozontal or vertical.  You can also push the red button and detach the holder from the mount.  Handy if you want to take your phone inside without removing it from the waterproof envelope and exposing it to moisture.<br /><br />The holder itself is a heavy-duty waterproof nylon.  The back is heavily reinforced and the velcro that keeps it closed  does the job.  The thick plastic &#34;window&#34; allows you access to your phone while protecting it from rain.  It's roomy enough to handle even the new larger phones and phones that are in a case.<br /><br />***** I was given a free sample of this product.  The seller offered nothing but the sample and asked for nothing but an honest opinion.*****  Everyone who's seen this (and some of them are experienced bikers) has been impressed.  All of them commented that the price is right and that it looks like it will stand up to a LOT of hard use - which is what a bike-mount phone holder gets.  The seller must agree, since they offer a full year's warranty. The design is good and both the materials and the workmanship are excellent.  If you ride in the rain, you should consider it."
1,Really very nice piece of equipment.  Sets snug as a bug in a rug and is great fun when Periscoping.  No need to try to prop my iphone when using GPS either.  This is absolutely the greatest.
-1,Phone did not work with this case on.  Quite disappointing.
1,No bubbles and extremely easy to use
1,"I registered my product at fusionexcelintl.com, it worked perfectly."
-1,It's just ok.. seems pretty flimsy.I wont be using it
1,Great product. Easy to order.
0,"Bought the two pack on Amazon…  one was okay….fairly easy to install.  The other actually had a bubble in the glass…  I finally figured out that it wasn't a piece of lint causing the problem.  Looked under magnification to find a bubble in the glass.  Also,,  the edges do not seal well..  It is, I'm sure, a problem inherent with all iPhone 6 tempered glass protectors because of their stiffness…  Love the fact that it doesn't scratch easily….  Update:  A replacement was delivered promptly.  Now, four months later I've had an interesting occurrence.  My iPhone 6 screen has several cracks from side to side.  However, the tempered glass protector is not cracked.  I don't know how the cracks occurred.  I didn't drop my phone.  I'm not sure what to make of this other than it seems obvious that the protector screen is much more durable than the iPhone screen, otherwise the protector would have been cracked as well.  The three star rating still stands due to the bubbles in the first screen and the sealing issues around the edges."
1,Exactly what i needed. Works in my 08 f250. Thanks!
1,So happy with my case i so would buy from this seller again an the case came quicker then i thought i give this seller five stars an would recommend to my friends an family 😊
-1,Received it and that day it was leaking water. Really sad because this is so pretty
-1,Stopped charging after only two months use...will never purchase again.
0,Ok case for the price
1,"&#34;The headphone have a great sound quality when listening to music. I've been told that I am heard clearly when using it during a call. The headphones are really comfortable around my neck, they're flexible and light. They also last me a long time until I have to charge them again.&#34;"
1,Hits hard great amp!
1,This little case is still around and in good shape. I purchased this almost over a year ago and am just now posting a review but the case is still in tact and in great shape. Thanks for a good quality product!
0,Good
1,"Love this cable! Durable, no tangles, just the right size. Couldn't ask for anything more!"
1,Great for size and power!
1,"Overall it is very good, but the plastic kickstand broke almost immediately."
-1,Stopped working after 6 month.
-1,Incorrect product - label is correct BUT does not fit. Check before ordering or else you'll end up returning like me. No fun.
1,Awesome...love it
1,"Quick delivery. Item as described, easy to install 10/10."
1,"The battery arrived quickly.  Turns out the phone I bought the battery for was totally broken, so I bought another G'zOne, same model  the battery works, but it is thicker than the original one.  I can not use my charging station, or belt clip with it.  I can still charge it with the direct plug in wire.  It was very reasonably priced and had free shipping!  I will keep it for electric outages or when I go camping.  Please note these phones are not Labrador Retriever proof!"
0,It does the job. Doesn't stay in the vent long with frequent retrieval sin your phone.
-1,Does not work with Samsung S5.
1,it works great
1,Easy to install.  The rubber tabs provide a secondary line of defense and sense of security for when you hit those unexpected bumps in the road.
1,"I love this case; and now that I store my wallet's contents in the same place as my iPhone, I have renamed the App &#34;Find my iPhone&#34; to &#34;find my wallet!&#34;"
1,"Works as expected several months in. And such a pretty color, too! :-)"
1,This works great.I did have an issue with the items but their customer service support helped me fix the issue right away. This helps so much getting the kids electronic devices charged for school fast and easy...no more looking for free plug ins or half charging an item so the next one can be charged...this saves my day!!
1,Great.
-1,The white portions of this discolored significantly in a short period of time and no cleanser I have tried would restore its whiteness. It now resides in the garbage.
-1,Doesn't stay in place on the Fitbit Charge
1,"These cable are amazing.  They are made solid!  I don't think the USB plug ends will ever loosen up, and the braided sheathing should give this cable years of useful life.  I plan to order more soon."
1,"Fits perfectly, looks great."
1,Exactly as described
1,Amazing screen protector. I've had it for over a couple months and still doing the job. Very easy to apply as well
-1,Sound quality pretty decent and would have given it a 4 stars but somehow died after 2 months of using.
1,It looks great for G note 3
1,"Arrived  supper fast. .<br />Definitely Waterproof<br />Only downside was the cover is huge, other than that its a great product for such a decent price."
-1,"Ugly fit...Bad fit, the phone wobbles inside...<br />OK glossy print at the back, but nothing special...<br />Waste of money and time!<br /><br />Was in the bin after just few minutes on.<br /><br />Will keep looking.<br />I would give it half a star if I can..."
1,"We charge 4 Nexus 7 tablets multiple times a day, and occasionally phones. This thing just sits there and does our bidding (as long as our bidding is charging devices). Anker is a great company, and they completely stand behind their products."
1,"LOVE this case! Hated my Lifeproof case for the 6 Plus-I couldn't hear or be heard, unlike with my Lifeproof for iPhone 5. Love this Merit case & for a fraction of the price of the Lifeproof case."
1,"Great little holder. It's meant for your car, but I also use it on my night stand to watch videos when I'm going to bed. It grips my phone really well. The only downside is the vent clip doesn't work that well in my truck."
1,My niece loved this cover.  It provides great protection for the iPhone.
-1,Does not stick well. One corner already curling up.
1,It work very well...
0,Works just fine.
-1,It was so cheap I couldn't put it in my phone. Ordered something else
-1,When you put the battery in the back will not close and so it wont stay on. Im returning this product as it does not meet the requirements it offers.
1,Nice case for showing off your iPhone.  I use it to protect the skin I adhered to the bs I of my phone
1,"Worked great, very durable."
1,this works great. leaves no marks on my phone at all. its very easy to apply and left no bubbles! thank you for making this a review product! i love it
1,Great quality
1,Very sturdy and looks great. I love how it feels.
-1,crap
1,"After trying multiple cell holders in the car, I am still stunned by how much better this one is!!  So simple, and so perfect.  Literally makes me a better driver, because I'm never &#34;messing&#34; with a contraption to get my hands-free setup just right --- the magnet makes it effortless. Thanks for inventing! :)<br /><br />June 2016 Update -- I have re-ordered these 3 times as gifts for friends, because once they see mine in action they flip for it!  Several of us had tried other brands that didn't have strong enough magnet, so were frustrating to use.  Thanks for being strong, WizGear!! - K"
1,Like
1,Love it
1,Love it is. Very easy to use.
1,"It is an excellent replacement for the one that came originally with my VIPER 5902 security system, which was fading out and the key ring fell off.<br />I've only had it for a couple of months, so it is too soon to know if this one will fade out too."
1,Used for iPod.  Works fine.  Makes taking a selfie easy.  Not complicated to figure out.
1,This case fits my HTC One M8 perfectly! It said it was going to take a long time to get here but it actually came like a full two weeks sooner. It's just as beautiful as the picture. I don't know why but it took me a little wiggling to get the charm to fit into the aux space but now that it's in it looks super cute! It looks very good and has an awesome price to match. And if it ends up falling apart in a few months then I can just easily replace it.
1,I have nothing but expectations met great sound quality pairing was easy and love the color
1,This is great!  Just the right length!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given a discount on this item in exchange for testing and giving my unbiased and honest review.
1,"This product is really quite amazing. The case comes in two pieces -- one inner protective case that is made of a sturdy material, the second is the holder which I can loop the armband through. LOVE that I can slide my phone downward to remove it easily from the second casing mid-workout then slide it upward when I'm ready to go again.<br /><br />I use it mainly for yoga and dance; my phone stays in place and I don't feel restricted."
0,I love they way it looks! But the two things that bug me are the fact that it slides off when i pug in my charger or headphones amd i have a a gorilla glass screen protector and it bubbles on the side with this case.
1,Great Product and Service!
1,Great
1,"Nice case if you are looking for clear protection for your iPhone, this case does it's job very well and it looks good while giving you more than enough protection for the average user. I have been demo-ing NewTrent cases over the last six months and they never disappoint, great build quality and very little bulk. This case is a steal at this price and it does it's job well, very well!"
0,"This a great Case for protection. The 3 things why i did not give it a better rating is @1 once you put it on,I can not get it off. #2 the on/off side button is very hard to push to turn on or off.#3 edge around the screen I wish it was less slippery. But for toughness and protecting your phone it is great."
1,Fast delivery and overall I'm happy with the case
0,It has good protection and isn't loose
-1,"Takes forever to charge my Samsung S5, supposedly it takes an hour to fully charge not the case."
-1,DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!
1,"I love it.is so pretty. the only thing is; you can't put away to much in it,just few things as I'd credit cards.few things. But other wise.I recommended."
0,Bad stopping itself
1,"Cute case for a teenage girl, she loves it!"
1,"Awesome case! I have a friend who works at a cell phone store, he asked where i got it from, when i told him how much, he was super suprised and said it was actually really nice case!"
1,I love the fact that it comes in multiple sizes that you can choose. Great
1,Great product really makes the phone look nice and it protects it
1,"This product works well for the price, I've tried this on my iPhone and my android phone, It took a little getting used to becauseit blocks out sound very well, The battery life is acceptable and I have ran a half marathon with it and had plenty of power left."
-1,"I love the concept of this charger, but unfortunately it just doesn't work very well.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it just doesn't do the job it's intended to.  The charger is VERY position critical.  Your phone has to be just right on the charger otherwise it starts with the flashing lights and stops charging.  It charges just fine when the phone is positioned correctly, but the second issue is that it doesn't stay where you put it.  Any amount of vibration seem to allow the phone to slide down the face of the charger and move out of position.  I should have known that when they had a protective plastic sheet over the sticky rubber where the phone sits that there could be a problem.  I cleaned the rubber with a lint free cloth and water and didn't seem to help.  In the time I have been typing this review, my phone has slid off the sweet spot and stopped charging.  I am not jumping up and down on my keyboard.  My desk is not a board on a pillow.  I would have given this 2 stars since it does technically work, but when I come back after a couple of hours, expect to find my phone with a useful amount of charge only to find it has gone in to power saving mode just doesn't cut it.  I will be returning this charger and getting a 3 coil stand with a shelf for my phone to sit on.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />RH"
1,"TOOK A LITTLE LONGER THAN EXPECTED, BUT THE CASE WAS DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  THE CASE GIVES MY PHONE A MORE STURDY LOOK."
1,This is my second Anker battery purchase - bought one for my laptop too. Both work great. Happy customer!
-1,Only 1 worked
1,Arrived in original packaging and way ahead of schedule. Haven't used it because it's a (sentimental) backup.
0,"The volume controls stop working in 2 days, :( besides that they are ok"
1,Incredible screen protector. The technique used to apply the protector itself is just magnificent. I'm very pleased.
1,"I have tried many others... For myself, these CCM's are without a doubt the BEST yet.<br />The internal pen is a major plus!"
1,I love the mint green color. It's a nice case. Very protective.
1,Love this product !!!!!<br />I brought two and they match my phone .
1,"Nice size. Good build quality. Compatible with all my devices.  UPDATE: After 13 months of regular use, the folding prongs broke off. The unit is warranted for 18 months. I sent an email to Sunvalleytek, and they responded promptly confirming my device was under warranty and that they would send a free replacement. The replacement arrived quickly, and it works fine.  Still 5 stars. A good device, well built, and backed by great customer service."
1,LOVE IT !  THE GLASS IS VERY CLEAR AND YOUR PHONE STILL WORKS WITH NO PROBLEMS. I WILL DIFFANTLY BUY THIS AGAIN IF I EVER NEED ANOTHER ONE.
1,works great - very easy to use.
1,My daughter loved this.  Thank you for shipping it in time.
1,Works perfectly with my iphone 6.
1,"nice, cheap and best"
-1,Was advertised as new but clearly was not a brand new battery. 1 Star *
1,Fast delivery and looks great!
1,"Great product, affordable price, meets all  expectations, comparatively user friendly."
-1,Case nothing like the picture presented. Very disappointed
1,5 stars
1,It works great and I love that everything is on the front not the back
1,"I dont usualy write reviews but this thing is awesome works great holds charge for several charging cycles over several days which is great for me becuase I'm always mobile and I do everything via my phone. The 4 usb power ports great for multiple devices. It is alittle heavy but its alot of battery. Before I bought this portable battery I would carry a mini jump start battery which worked well but didn't look as cool, it had only 1 usb port and cost twice as much. This charger is super simple highly recommend."
1,Is great.  A little bulky but it has a lot of Juice.  I can charge my Galaxy S4 4 times full.
-1,Don't waste time & money ..this Tracker working  for  two weeks first time ..  I ask for replace item .. the new one work two week ...  just waste my time... hard for SYNC  and use the app ... now i try get my money back...  conclusion is really bad..  again I waste time & Money front MAY 03 to Now only work 4 weeks..  Really!!!<br />Malo Malo no pierdan tiempo y Dinero... solo funciono 4 semanas entre Mayo y agosto .. lo cambie una vez y lo remplazaron el segundo lo mismo!!
1,"This case is heavy duty as described, but yet it is sleek and highly durable.  For the price, I highly recommend this case to any other name-brand on the market today.  You won't be disappointed!!  Thanks."
1,"Worked great for my camping trip. Charged this during the day, my phone during the night while i slept. Had enough juice to charge my s4 a good 3 or 4 times before it needed re-charged. worth the money."
1,Great fit & meets use expectations. Very comfortable and easy to use touch screen. Would definitely recommend!!!
1,Great price for a great case.  Works great and looks even better. I love that it comes with the tempered glass screen protector.
1,It looks great
1,This is the best case for the S5 in my opinion.
1,so far so good
1,So Convenient.
0,"it works well and I was really excited about the stand, but after a while, the silvers starts to peel."
-1,I have bought this item twice and it has broken both times.  I love the ease and feel (sleekness) of the product but it is not a durable product.
1,"This is a great case. Within two days of putting it on my phone I dropped my phone on the steps leading up to our deck. It bounced down the steps and landed on a landscaping stone we used in our walkway. My heart went to my gut as I just knew it was going to be a crushed mess. When I picked up my phone, it was perfect! No scratches, dents, and the faceglass was fine! This is a good phone case. I'm not going to say it will protect every phone, but it protected mine!<br />*I received this case for a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. All opinions are my own."
-1,"Definitely it wasnt as good as they said, Phone died after 2 months. I bought it to bring it to Ecuador,<br />I had to pay to unblock it here,  Then the battery  always discharged quickly, finally last friday  august 28 the phone didnt charge anymore,<br />I bought another battery and didnht resucite, Its a piece of garbage, I am in southamerica, who is going to replace it??<br />I trusted I bought a  great phone but it was a rubbish,  BE CAREFUL"
1,Brilliant bit of kit especially as you can plug in your device while charging the power pack.
1,Very convenient...
1,Great product at a very great price
1,Good
1,I've had it for about a month now.  So far it has worked on my 6+  I'll update if that ever changes.
1,It's very handy for a person on the go. I like it.
1,Not a a lot of great cases for the galaxy edge phone that are great for protecting the edges. But this case really does. I would love if it would protect the front of the phone. But very happy overall with is case.
1,"It's big, bulky, and overpriced. A half dozen little country-specific adapters would cost less and take up less space in your luggage; but my daughter liked the simplicity of this item and continues to use it to charge her phone even when not traveling. At least it's lightweight.<br /><br />And yes, even if you put black tape over the light, it still glows."
1,"This works well for me. Charges my iPhone 6, doesn't take too long to charge the power bank itself, and the indicators make it easy to see just what I have left for juice. This is roughly the same dimensions as my iPhone 6, a bit thicker, and it is quite heavy, so if you're looking for something to keep in your pocket, this isn't for you. However to keep in a bag as a backup, this is perfect!"
1,Exactly what was pictured and advertised.  Quick shipping.  No problems.
1,"I had no problem pairing with my cell phone. Sound is very clear on both ends. I haven't listened to music yet.,want to save battery. I found out too late that the battery can only be charged approx. 300 times then , garbage. I bought them to listen to TV at night. When I get the transmitter put on my TV , I will update with the results. Maybe 5 stars, we'll see ! The fit is good . I have a larger than average head and I did not need to adjust the headband . I remembered that someone said that the band would break in the middle , so I slid them on at the temple and then pushed them  down over my ears , avoiding stretching them."
1,Great all the way around...
1,fast shipping . looks like picture
1,"I ended up cracking my old screen protector, and purchased another one because it was such good quality"
1,Nice ribbon-like lanyards in an assortment of pretty colors.  Fun to coordinate the lanyards to match my daily outfits :)
1,It works as expected. Very happy with my purchase
1,"I was tempted to give this a lower rating simply because of the nauseating smell when first opened, but it is getting better with time. (HOPEFULLY it will disappear altogether!) My phone fits perfectly and the arm band is comfortable. I was at an event this past weekend and didn't want to carry a purse so I used this to hole my phone, ID and some cash and just strapped it to my calf (hidden by capris) There is even a spot to hide a key and this trumped the smell. It doesn't look like it would fit small arms. Overall great product!"
1,My father loved this case. Still uses it today. It's slim and easy to handle. Not hard to remove and replace.
1,"I have purchase a couple of competing products in the magnetic holder category.  Usually I have to be careful about the type of case on my phone and the way I position the phone on the vent-mount holder.  Not so with iSwivel.  It attaches securely to my big and heavy iPhone 6 Plus and has never varied its position, even on the gravel roads I travel daily.  Other holders have dropped my phone after a bump and rough spot.  No so the Swivel.  The the added bonus of the clamp for bulky cases is just so cool.  This is definitely the best system around for a larger phone.  Thanks Matrix!"
1,"Absolutely what I was looking for and its length is exactly what I wanted, superb quality"
-1,The vibrate switch would not toggle with this case. I had to order a new one. All other features of the case seemed ok.
1,Fashionable wristbands.  Love it. Small size fits my tiny wrists.
1,great
1,"This case gives the Note 3 the sleek and stylish design that most people bought the phone for, but won't offer as protection that is as good as other cases such as Otterbox's. If you are really worried about the safety of this really expensive phone, you should consider more durable cases.[[ASIN:B00F9VRNJ6 OtterBox Defender Series Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Black]]"
1,Fits perfect.
-1,I love the look and feel but I have gone through 4 cases in 6 months for the same reason as everyone else has posted. If they sold just the outer bumper for half the cost I might rate it 3 stars. Customer service was good but seriously....4 times? They need to sell the outer bumper separately. Poor engineering.
1,A+
1,"I bought this phone about a year and a half ago and am very pleased with it. It's a very sturdy phone and has withstood countless falls without a case, including falls on asphalt and down a hill. When it drops the back cover of the phone comes off and the battery falls out, but I simply put the battery back in and clip the back on. The screen has never even cracked. It continues to work like always; I don't even worry when I drop my phone without it's case anymore. Also, I brought it kayaking with me once and stuck it in the waterproof compartment, but it got a little wet anyhow. When I opened the phone the inside was quite wet, so I quickly took out the battery, dried it off, blew in the cracks, and set it in front of a fan. It was fine!<br />  Besides durability, this phone is very good looking, especially in white. The white shows dirt faster, but this is very easy to remedy, just unclip the back of the phone and wash it with soap and warm water. DO NOT get the battery or phone wet! This phone can't have many apps at once, maybe five, depending how big they are. But it has a removable mini SD card, which is very nice. And it works well for Bluetooth, texting, talking, WiFi, and everything you'll need on a phone. The camera is pretty good too. Plus It's relatively inexpensive. VERY nice phone. I love this phone ! !"
0,"The case itself is beautiful but the more I use it the more it breaks down. The flip over locking flap is almost completely broken into 2 parts and is only being held together by a small piece of plastic. However, it does a very good job of holding what I need for a wallet and protecting my phone from drops. There are better products on the market but this is a good starter case or for those on a budget."
1,"This case was exactly what I expected with the exception of the supplied screen protector. I had hoped that it would cover the whole screen, but it leaves the top half inch of the screen unprotected."
1,"Perfect case for the iphone 6, nice coverage"
1,"Amazing product! Never  scratched, chipped or broke the entire time I had my s5! I even gouged it with my house jey whike showing it to a friend and absolutley nothing happened to the protector or my phones screen!! If they made the same product for the Note Edge I would have purchased it in a heart beat. Traded a family member my s5 for the edge ... Miss the s5 because of this tempered glass protector.<br /><br />A must buy product!"
-1,Do not buy this case!!!!! I have a brand new iPhone 6 plus that is completely ruined!!! The bottom piece where you charge your phone is poorly made and comes open very easy!
1,Works perfectly and well. Only issue is that the wire could be longer. But well worth the money.
1,Good quality
0,"It's okay. Application was fairly simple, but it does not have very good screen coverage -- too large a gap between the screen protector and the edge of the screen, especially when compared to others I have used."
0,suited my needs
1,needed it
0,Sound is good but it only comes with one size earbud and becomes uncomfortable on longer runs.
0,"It's adorable and exactly as pictured, but a bit of a pain to put on. It comes in two pieces: a flexible case and a hard &#34;backing&#34; that slips on top of the case. The flexible case is just a tiny bit too big so that snapping the hard backing on top of it can be tricky. Sometimes the edges of the soft case fold under the backing and which makes it hard to access the side buttons. If you don't change the batteries often then it's not a problem. But I often have to take the case off to switch batteries (I charge the batteries separately) and it gets a bit cumbersome."
1,"This product is certainly better than having to figure out where to put my phone when I am doing turn by turn navigation.<br />The only issue that I have had is that it does block one of the main vents for air for the driver, but this I can manage do work around because I would much rather not have to find my phone on the floor or in my cup holder when its telling me where I have to turn next.<br />Overall a very good product.  Works well with my Samsung 6, Samsung 5 as well as an Iphone."
1,Good item
1,Great leather case
1,"This case has a very cute design and it fits an iPhone 6 perfectly. The case is soft and flexible, so in my opinion, its good for the looks, but I'd like a more rigid case for peace of mind when it comes to safety. The case doesn't cover up any important ports or the camera, but does cover every side and the corners well. The case is easy to put on and take off.  This product was purchased at a discount in exchange for a review."
0,the card doesnt fit so well it keeps falling out.
1,Exactly what I wanted....fantastic item and fast delivery.
1,"this is the best way to go, if you use a lot of time online or what ever.  great cover for extended batteries."
1,Works great!  No road noise from inside the semi truck.
1,"Screen was in perfect condition, tools were good, and instructions were a bonus. Swapped the screen with little trouble, although I have fixed about 5 different phones for friends. I believe a novice can swap as long as you have a well lite area and some patience."
1,"Excellent product.  Absolutely love how easy it is, to snap it on.  Holds my Samsung Note 3 really well.  Was so happy with the product, that I bought another one within a few days, for my wife."
0,Ok for price.<br />fast delivery
1,Ordered this case for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It is very durable and fits his phone perfectly. Would definitely recommend this phone case to anyone;
1,"Didn't want a case for my G2 initially, but after a fall at work I had little choice. Looks pretty cool, has a nice sized lip around the screen of the phone, and is pretty rugged in general. It also doesn't add too much bulk to the phone. It's not slim mind you, but it's liveable"
1,"I have found nothing bad to say about this protector. It's fit my phone, was easy to apply, and a week later I'm still happy with my buy. It's worth the few bucks"
-1,This is a bulky clumsy protector. May as well wear block on your watch.
-1,The screw fell out of bad when it was on wrist and amost lost apple watch. The bad also does not fit in locking  mechanism easy have to force it
1,"These work well. However, I have had a great deal of trouble keeping them in place in my ears.I wish they had a hook for your ears."
1,"Great fit, love the feel of it."
1,This works exactly like it's suppose to. Simple device and simple job. :)
1,"I was at first sceptical about riding a Blu phone based on some review, but since we have never had a problem with an item I have bought directly from Amazon, I ordered it.  For the price it is a good reliable phone for every day smartphone uses.  It will not replace my Samsung S5, but it is a good secondary phone as I have one phone for each of the networks in Jamaica.  I would definitely recommend this phone."
1,Arrived in great condition.  Worth the money.
1,"Easy to use. Charges multiple devices multiple times for several days before this battery needs to be recharged. I have charged iPhones, iPad, Apple Watch, and a Windows tablet PC using this device without difficulty."
1,"It took me couple weeks to shop around for a decent portable wifi companion that will set up a closed hotspot to share files with limited device.<br /><br />The set up is very easy. Download the app and within 5 minutes, everything is set. (I doubt if you even need to app at all).<br /><br />Now I have a wifi for my device and co-workers to share file and print on the go.<br /><br />One note - I do not need www access, just sharing between devices. This HD companion do have the capability to connect to www but will let it for other reviews to tell you the experience as my main use is a close wifi hub to share files and print on the go."
1,"This air vent mount for my Ford Escape is still the best design.  My vents are curved like in the product photographs so that my Samsung phone remains upright.  The cool air when the AC is on keeps the phone cooled down, but in the winter this may be a different problem.  This design also clamps down on  my SD slot to my PC, where I can mount my phone for USB charging.<br /><br />The clamp expands to fit a wide variety of phones by pulling the arms apart.  My sample looks solidly built in a dark charcoal grey.<br /><br />I received a free sample in exchange for an honest review"
-1,Very tight on head and gave me headaches. Not loud enough to cover road noise and no noise canceling mic
1,"Best case I've owned.  Two problems though that marked it down a star, ordered the blue border but got gray/black and took so long to be delivered I almost forgot I had even ordered it."
1,Great
1,very good!
1,"This cover did not look good when I got it.<br />Once I put it on my phone , looks tremendously awesome. I love it and other people ask me where I got it.  I have not dropped my phone so I would not be able to tell if the cover will handle a good drop.  Will update in a few months about the case"
-1,"I am not a fan of this product for the following reasons, and each one would keep me from recommending this product to anyone.<br />1) The plug fits very loose in the power port in my car and it slides out<br />2) Cannot use all 3 charging cords together.<br />3) Using only the micro USB on my Samsung Galaxy S4 would not charge it fast enough to use the GPS while charging a battery that was low on charge.<br />This is a complete waste of $20"
-1,Its already broken.
1,These are amazing! Seriously like a glass plate on the screen! But leaving the touch and HD perfect! Great!
1,"I wanted to love this, as my Galaxy S4 eats battery power.  I get less than a day of use, so the prospect of doubling my battery life was appealing.  With this PowerSkin installed, I now get a day of use without charging, which is an improvement. The trade-off is, the sacrifice of some protection.<br /><br />This unit uses an interesting approach.  As you can see from the photo, the extended battery itself is not attached to the PowerSkin.  You use this battery in place of your normal battery in the phone, then the normal battery piggybacks on this one, essentially creating a double-thick battery.  Then, you push the phone into the back cover (it will sort of click into place). Last, add the side cover bumper over the front of the phone and click it together.<br /><br />The pros of the approach are that the case adds minimal size to the phone. With every other power case I've had (granted, they have all been for iPhones), the phone slides into the case, where you push the cable connection into a built-in plug and the case has its own cable connection point.  This means that those cases are not only thicker than the phone, but add about a half inch to the length because of the plug.  This PowerSkin adds very little length, and you keep the original cable connection, which is nice.  Also, with most other cases, you have to manually activate the battery backup, usually after your main battery discharges.  With the PowerSkin, the extra battery essentially becomes part of the regular battery, creating a 5200 mAh battery instead of the standard .  There is nothing to activate; the extra power is just always there.  I don't really know how the batteries discharge (i.e., if one goes, then the other, or both at the same time), I just know there is more power.<br /><br />The cons to this are the case itself.  The separate bumper is plastic, which I feel may end up breaking too soon. When it's all put together, if you squeeze the sides of the phone, you feel the bumper flexingin and out.  Also, the back does not fully click into the bumper; it's too tight. If you look at the pictures, two of the corners have a little gap, where I could not get the tabs to fully click together.  If you do click them together, something else unclicks.  The case itself has not come undone, but there is that small gap where it is not clicked together.  Also, the whole case is a smooth plastic, not grippy.  If it got wet, or your hands were sweating, it would be slippery.  Since there is not a screen protector, you need to be careful not to drop the phone.  The case this replaces was an Otterbox, which was both grippy and had a screen protector.<br /><br />For less than 16 bucks, this is a good deal if you need the extra power to make it through your day.  I do like the fact that it gives you more battery life and does not make the phone any longer.  But, I think it could be improved.  Even at a higher price, say 26 bucks, adding a grippier rubber-like surface (like the Otterbox) and adding a screen protector to the side bumper, would make this a fantastic case, that protects your phone well and gives great battery life. I give this 3.5 stars (but Amazon makes me round to a whole number).<br /><br />I was provided a unit for an honest review."
1,Very pleased with the product.
1,Very nice
1,"Works great, what else can I say?"
0,"The case has a nice fit & finish and is as pictured online. I took a risk, as I wanted to slim down my previous phone's case a bit but still maintain protection. Unfortunately, this case appears that it would not offer the protection I need. The black &#34;rubber&#34; layer is fairly thin and not rigid, and the outer hard layer around the edge is not quite as rigid as I had hoped. It seems it would protect best if the phone landed on a corner or it's face, however a landing on it's back or side (against a hard object or uneven surface) does not appear to offer much protection. Considering the glass back of the Note 5 this is a concern for me. As a result I have reverted back to a more durable case.<br /><br />That said, case it great looking and those who are not in need of as much protection will likely consider it a great option."
1,great
-1,This screen protector had a horrible &#34;halo&#34; all around the screen. I would not recommend.
1,"This case is everything they said it was , I absolutely love this case !! I've been waiting for  awhile for the perfect case and I found it..Everyone asks me where I got it and they couldn't believe what I paid for it , so yes...I highly recommend this case !!"
-1,"Unless you buy from Apple, all iPhone 6 screen replacements are sub par.  I've bought 4 different ones from 3 vendors, and I found the more expensive iCracked is the better of all."
1,love it
0,I absolutely loved this when I got it but after about 3 days of owning it and using it I went to take it off to temporarily store my debit card inside and as I took it off the entire back plastic piece split in half. I would buy another one but it's just too expensive for some plastics that might break again.
1,Exellent product! Fits perfectly on my note5!
-1,Clip broke to easily
0,"I bought first one 2 years ago. Configuration instructions were a bit clumsy, but the switch always worked. LAN or WAN did not matter. So, I bought 5 more. Two month later added 4 more... Now I have total of 10 at my house. And then Belkin begins to fix their bugs by issuing software upgrades. They would fix one thing - and brake something else, and so on.<br />Now I have to wait for list of switches to display their current statuses. At random time some will show off network status. I will get them connected after another refresh... It takes 5 to 10 seconds to turn them on.<br />I know what people from Belkin will say to me, &#34;It's your LAN network&#34;.... Blah, blah, blah... Like 105mbs with R7000-100PAS is not fast enough...<br />I think problem is Belkin's IT department; why don't you folks test something for a change before releasing your upgrades?"
0,Does not stand good
1,great
-1,It didn't last long broke to easy
1,It took a while to get here but the product is great.
1,"The little light blew out after about a week, if that lasted longer this would be 5/5.  I like that the light isn't always on, and for my phone (HTC One), it charges at about 1% per minute, much faster than most chargers I have used.  Love this thing."
1,"It worked great for my class's embedded programming display cabinet. I soldered on a power jack for a DC power adapter. The only reason it didn't get a five star rating, is because it doesn't explain how to connect audio."
-1,Didn't work with my Galaxy S5 phone.  Designed for smaller phones with out bulky cases.
0,Cleaned and used adhesive primer and following proper steps started to lift after 5 days
-1,"Managed to replace the battery with tools provided.  But, new battery is not nearly as good as original equipment.  The new battery provided approximately the same life as the original worn out 2 year old battery that I was replacing.  Bottom line: if you are replacing your battery so your phone has the same life it had when it was new, this battery will not do that."
1,"The plastic shell scratches very easily, but feels great in the hand, protects relatively well"
-1,It craped out after a month
1,"My mom works at A hotel. She can talk on the phone as long as she stays busy. However, she can't hold the phone and work at the same time. I seen the iGearPro on Amazon and knew it would be perfect for her.<br /><br />  The iGearPro gives her options. She can listen to music or talk on the phone with it. The device is very small. When she wears it, you can't tell. Her hair covers it. It connects to her iPhone 4s quickly and has good signal. It's charged by a micro USB cord that's included. When it's fully charged, the battery life is great.<br /><br />  My mom really loves the iGearPro. I feel like you can't beat the price. I was sent this product to test and review. I am in no way compensated for this. I am honest when I say, this product is wonderful!"
1,"I love this device. Easy to setup , and always on. When I get into my car , my phone connects to it right away. I have no problem controlling my phone with it either. This is a must have for cars that don't have Bluetooth audio connection in the car."
-1,"power cable was intermittent, returned unit."
1,"Thick cables, good price. Fit snug in phone. Feels like you could slam the door on them a few times with no damage."
-1,"Initially, I actually really liked this light. The light is bright enough to see what you're doing pretty well in the dark. It holds a lot of charge...After the initial charging, it charged my iPhone maybe 5 or 6 times. It seems to register solar light quite easily (not sure how quickly solar light charges it...I've only charged it from the outlet so far).<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it totally messed up my iPhone battery. My battery used to last for about two days on a full charge. Now, it can barely make it through one day without me having to charge it again. This happened after charging my phone on it maybe 2 times and I could tell there was a big difference in battery life. On top of that, I can't get the battery pack on the light to recharge all the way now. I've had it plugged in now for over 24 hours and it still says it is only half way charged. I think this light will still be useful to have, but I'm upset that my iPhone seems to have been permanently damaged."
1,"I always love new gadgets or accessories for new gadgets. This new apple watch stand is pretty cool. Serves multiple purposes not just docks it and allows to charge but also provides a nice decorative stand. I have a few stands for my other watches as I actively collect watches (Rolex, Breitling, Panerai and many more). The band holder is actually the right size and you could use this to hold any watch but of course with the cable coming in unless you have a smart watch there is no function other then a stand. But as I'm like most people I have so many devices around my computer and bed it is crazy. Also I do like that it has a weight at the bottom of it to keep it upright as a lot of stands for whatever reason don't and they constantly fall over.<br /><br />I did receive this watch stand at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
1,"keeps phone completely dry, It's only flaw is it's difficult to press the picture button under water."
0,Good phone in that price range.
1,Great shields. No glare on my phone. Lasts for a good while.
-1,"The Colorful tree version of the S6 case did not fit the S6, it almost did, but the bottom right corner of the phone was hanging out just enough to expose the frame.  When it fell off my knee today (with the case open, as I was using the phone on speaker) that corner of the screen shattered.  No matter how much I have tried to fit that corner of the phone into the case, it will not fit.  A new screen on a S6 is $235, I am very dissatisfied.  The case also interferes with all of the chargers, including the Samsung charger.<br /><br />I have used these cases before on my S4, and I love them.  Hopefully, I can find a better S6 case."
1,"Very good, the only thing I dislike is that it makes the images look blurry."
1,Love it great protection
1,stays clean longer and easier to clean than the plastic that  I used before. Easy to apply.
-1,It didn't work
1,"Working fine so far. We have had trouble with these dying early, but this one is supposed to last. I like that it comes with an 18mo warranty."
1,I bought this for my phone and I really liked it. This screen protector is very durable. I like that it comes in a pack of six so if you need more for your phone you can have extras !
-1,I received this case with my iwatch stand. It fit very well and I thought it was doing a great job of protecting my watch. Little did I know what it was doing under the surface. I took off the case to clean my watch and found a TON of scratches. I'm so upset. Be careful with this case!!!
1,"It's not the most elegant looking Bluetooth, and the rubber ear pieces don't work very well,  but the battery life is AMAZING."
1,Everything was perfect bus the measurments were uneven in the home button.
-1,It last me a few days
1,"I like this case, with exception of white chips/marks showing up on my blue case. It also shows wear compared to my wife's Caseology. I recommend getting light colors to avoid this issue."
1,Easy to apply and does the job!
-1,"These don't fit properly, but did protect while on there."
0,good
1,Great!
1,fits with case on IPhone 6plus
-1,The tabs keep breaking on this and causing it to sag outward
-1,never really quite feels comfortable in ear. sound is OK and controls are a bit awkward.
1,"Works great feels good in my hand, it has a tight fit that keeps its profile low, which is great for such a large phone, can barley feel the difference of no case and this one in my pocket. Have dropped it once or twice and it has done its job so far. I would say it was a great deal for a good product!"
1,Love it
-1,"The website you contact for product service doesn't even have this product listed to request a fix. That's pretty much all you need to know about it. It's a shame they had to make the thing collapsible because that's the root of all the complaints here. Tiny little swivel joint made of cheap plastic crap, likely to break in daily use, and if it breaks they're going to blame it on you.<br /><br />I also had the on/off switch break off and rattle around inside, but that was just a few tiny screws away from a fix."
1,gifted to my sis in India...working fine
0,"The case itself is fine.  The clear, protective face covering was difficult to put onto phone.  It has areas lifting away from phone face already.  I followed instrutions carefully but still it did not apply correctly."
1,this fits really well and is a great product. I liked it so much that I also bought one for an S3 we have. Very good price and service too
1,Great product for the price!
1,The NOOT battery charger is compact and efficient.  It works like a charm.
1,Great fit and access to all ports.
1,This was one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon to date! This charging case took my original factory battery and turned my phone into a super charged phone. I have been able to go over 24 hours without having to charge my phone!! I am a heavy user as I use my phone for work and personal and tend to use my phone to play music in my car as well as when I am working out. Love this case!! Only compliant is it could use more protection on the top and bottom of the case; perhaps a rubber outlining to provide more protection.
1,Perfect! It's exactly what I needed. Product looks great and built well. I highly recommend!
1,"I read a great review about this product on another site, and it's become the main charging hub for everyone, wherever I go. Very portable, and solid. I also bought of short USB cables to go with it. It detaches from it's power adapter leaving a short cable dangling from the charging base. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is, but it seems pointless. On the other hand, it doesn't detract from the overall functionality, which is perfect."
1,Case was for my daughter and she is very happy with it!
1,Good product
1,"I was so happy to receive the sample of the Micro USB 2.0, Magic-T 3.3ft/1m Braided A Male to Micro B Sync Charge Cables Cord Tangle-Free with Aluminum Connectors Part for Samsung, HTC, Sony and Other Android Tablets Smartphones [4-Pack] because with all children and all the adult grandchildren that come and go, we are always charging a wide variety of phones and tablets.  These four cords have been in almost constant use charging Kindles, Smartphones and various other tablets.  We like to get everyone together for family dinners and birthday celebrations so this past month we have had at least one gathering each week-end and these cords have been used heavy and performed just fine.  This is my honest experience with these four cords."
1,good
1,Love this thing. Allows me to simultaneously charge my Nexus 7 and my Galaxy Note phablet phone. Only occupies one AC outlet which can be a blessing when traveling.
-1,"Disappointed, as it does not &#34;support&#34; my I-Phone, and will not charge my I-pad."
1,This is cheap and the quality is the same as that of an Apple product.
-1,Picture scratches off
1,"Its an amazing case, works really nice underwater!"
1,Received super fast and well packaged. The item itself is very good. Easy to apply to my phone and leaves no air bubbles upon application. Didn't have to go in to the store to get it applied. I like that you get 3 for the price of 1. Item was provided at a discounted rate for review purposes but that does not influence the validity and truthfulness of my review.
1,"This item was EXACTLY what I was needing.  I have a Bluetooth speaker (jawbone) attached to my bike frame but it is difficult to access the buttons so I had been attaching my phone to my waist to adjust the volume but this was uncomfortable.  I now keep my phone in my bike bag and can pause, play, control the volume and skip tracks....perfect with this button attached to my handlebars.  For my bike that has a smaller diameter handle bar, I have added some electrical tape to the area where I attach the button.  Item is very responsive, is small and works great."
1,Good product but the paint seems to ware off with time. For the price its still worth it.
1,Works well
1,Great cell phone case. Very good quality and fits the phone perfectly!
-1,Inner lining of wallet ripped after one week of use. Ripped where plastic case is clued to the lining. Like the case besides this durability issue.
-1,I purchased the cables ~6 months ago. Half of the cables are not working anymore...I believe loose connections are causing the issues. I have other Micro USB cables (different brand) that I have used for many years without any issues.  Update 9/13/15: seller responded swiftly to my review and sent replacement cables right away. great customer service. i don't know if new cables are better...so far the cables are working fine. changed rating to 3 stars (from 1 star)...  Update 3/4/16: some of the new cables failed after less than 6 months ... wouldn't buy again
1,"I followed the &#34;hinge application&#34; advice and everything went smoothly until it was time to peel off the top layer.  When I did, the real protection layer came off with the top layer. Needless to say, this first failed attempt is a good lesson."
1,Excellent
-1,"The device is not able to read fuel consumption of a BWM 120D which make the device useless at trip analysis. Also it reports a cryptic error code from the powertrain without any explanation what it is. In short - this device is quite useless for me.  I just realized that all other 5-star reviews were written on July 26, 2015 which makes them feel like poor fake reviews!"
1,"I'm very happy with this purchase.  My old iPod/iPad wires would constantly stop working because they would get bent out of shape.  This wire is flat and tougher, so I'm hoping it's going to last a long time.  I also like the 6 foot length because it's better than the short ones my Apple products came with. My son loves it so much and he has been using it for his iPad, so I'm thinking of ordering another one just for me."
1,"Great price, Great Seller and good product. can't complain. Thanks I appreciate"
1,Case went on with ease. Very good looking case feels very durable I definitely recommend this case.
1,"Great coating for screen,  doesn't interfere with phones typing /swiping functions."
1,they work great
1,Product as described.
1,"I'm very happy with the product. I'm no fool, I put a piece of toilet tissue in the bag and sealed it, and put a brick on top of it under 3 feet of water for two days. The tissue was bone dry. I then went jetskiing with my iPhone."
0,i like the case but the belt clip is crap. breaks super easily.
0,Holster broke already but case is great
1,Great cord lightning fast charging!
1,Use it for to send audio bluetooth radar detector alerts to my motorcycle helmet intercom system. Works great. You do not need a mono to stereo adapter between the detector and transmitter. You will only get alerts through one speaker (mono) but it works.
-1,Connnected great. Static on every station I tried when playing music and on calls. I drove all over my city and tried several stations. Too bad because it was the perfect size.
1,Does exactly what it says on the Tin
-1,"small convenience, but not easy in/out of vent, two hands operation, and tilt down if the phone is not clipped below 1/2 way, but my phone has button in the way"
1,Functions extremely  well..  The best case I have ever used.. Have not dropped it as yet but it is very well made and I am sure that it will protect my phone.
1,Bought it for my wife and she loves to be able to use her phone even if she forgets to charge it.
1,OK
1,My girlfriend loves her case
1,It's working great (after you figure how to connect with the phone).
1,"Works good and serves it's purpose,it was difficult however to line up properly"
1,Great Value came with screen protector and stylus.
-1,"What the hell ? It didn't even come with tools.  I assume a &#34;full set&#34; means tools and all ??!! Thanks, not buying this again."
-1,Man BlueAnt has really dropped in design and quality. This was glitchy from the get go.
1,"Have only used this a few times since purchasing, but it has worked flawlessly and as expected.  Bought to take on a cruise so that we could recharge phones and devices on deck for listening to music and such.  Didn't end up using on deck, but did while we were out on excursions.  Can fully charge wife's iPhone5S several times before needing to be recharged.  I also like the size - surprising amount of stored power in a decent sized package."
0,"I HATE THAT EVERY THING GET CAUGHT IN THE GEMS AND THEM GEMS POP OUT ! BUT ITS A NICE CASE ,, AND VERY TIGHT"
1,"Led light is very useful, It shows charging, fully charged and alternates red and green when device is on and on the verge of being fully charge.  The longer cord is very useful, and the is much easier to plug and unplug."
1,I got this watch for my wife's birthday and she is an avid exerciser.  She does not go a day without telling me &#34;I love my watch!!&#34;. As she springs to her feet because the watch reminds her she has reached her standing goal.
0,"It's okay, not as strong as I thought it would be."
-1,The adapter seems to work fine but the cable is garbage.  Seemed to be OK for a while but now unless I am physically pushing the connector into my phone it won't connect.  Several times I have plugged in my phone overnight only to have it uncharged in the morning.  I bought some different cables that seem to be connecting better for now.  If you buy this item I highly recommend you purchase some extra cables to have on hand when the one that comes in the package fails.
1,"Nice finishing, works OK with my Samsung Galaxy and I need this device as my car does not have a USB plug."
-1,bad right out of the box.
1,good for price
0,Looks good at first but scratches up too much
1,"This is the only screen protector I've ever used that went on with no imperfections on the first try. I've used it for almost a year and it looks like it did the day I installed it. So far, it's completely scratch proof and it hides fingerprints."
1,"Functions as advertised. I dropped this phone a couple of a dozen times in a machine shop and only once did a crack appear, and even still the phone was completely functional and the crack did not obscure the screen; you have to angle the phone to try and find the crack it isn't even visible straight-on. The phone functioned for another month with the crack in the protector before I got a new one. The protector did exactly what it was supposed to, and even held together after it cracked. It does NOT cover the entire glass screen, but you would be hard pressed to damage the edge of the screen without hitting the rounded chamfer of the protector, and even if you did, the protector covers the entire visible portion of the screen, so it would not impair use."
1,"Working well for my Droid 4. Though the back cover does not catch all the time, it is sufficient."
1,Nice. If they last six months or more its the greatest deal on line!
1,"I bought these due to my wife's stroke last year. If I am out in the Apiary or in the Shop and she needs me , these work Awesome! But as to the range of them being 23 Miles is NOT true. the actual distance with these in an urban setting with houses , trees and such is about half a mile if that . now if I were on the top of a mountain , that was barren of obstructions like trees and such. And I was trying to talk with someone at the bottom 22 miles in a straight line , again with no obstructions like trees or natural terrain m MAYBE"
1,Haven't had many problems so far. Connecting everything was very simple. One problem I have found is that the music distorts when something is being charged with the sub and the volume notch isn't the most responsive.
1,"It came on time and it came with the case ,screen protector , pen everything! . it fits perfectly ! And looks really nice and i cant wait to use it next month :)"
0,Works good but does not fit kids .
1,"Grabs vent tightly, magnet is very strong even behind phone case. Phone stays stable and in position during driving."
-1,It broke within 2 weeks of use.  Wishing now I had purchased a lifeproof case.
1,Our son likes to throw the phone on the floor<br />Its completely safe with this case!!!!
1,Item is just as described and for a fraction of the cost as cases sold at retailers
1,it is not quite as bright pink as I thought it would be but it is a great case and I do love it.
1,Nice
-1,The battery is too big for my cellphone and I can't use it
1,"Was able to easily use the tool to replace my band. I did bend one of the pins, so it was nice that I was able to use one from my old band."
1,"Work very well. Background noise is loud and I can hear my transcription easily. Unfortunately, I can not wear this type of headset long. The pressure causes head aches after long periods of use. I prefer the kind that hang on the ears, these are not as good for noise canceling. This probably isn't an issue for most people. Have tried a lot of head sets and this is a good set. I would recommend them."
-1,Thought the case would be white and black but still glow in the dark.  It ended up being a really gross white yellowish color.
1,"Nice product, exactly like pictures"
0,I did not like it.
1,Good for the price.  Quality good. Comfort good. Stays in place.
-1,Returned...broke within 3 weeks and the rubber plug ripped.
0,The case  fit great but it had a peel off cover on the back that said please remove before using in black letters all over the case when I pulled it off all the words were on the case it was ruined so I had to through it away
-1,bad... broked easily
-1,Does not fit an IPhone 6 Lifeproof Case. Which is what I ordered it for. I will be returning the items.
-1,"This product looked great, and functioned great for exactly 12 hours. Unfortunately, after attaching it to my windshield the evening before, I got in the car in the morning to find it lying on the ground. After repeated attempts to re-attach it, it would keep falling off immediately, no suction. Upon further inspection I discovered that the suction cup had completely fallen apart (as you can see in the picture). Might I remind you that I had only had this product for 12 hours.<br /><br />It was a real shame too since the rest of the product seemed extremely sturdy, at it was one of the few car mounts out there that actually satisfied my needs (windshield attachment + long, flexible arm). I may ask for a replacement but it seems like from these other reviews (perhaps the ones not bought?) that it will very likely just happen again. Very disappointing."
1,Works great
1,Best thing ever
1,"Great phone cover, I just wish the orange was a little brighter and less coral. This is my 2nd cover for my 2nd phone. I would buy it again!"
1,"A quality design and usefulness. I have several cables attached to it for convenience... iPhone, iPad 2, Fitbit, and ports for more items if needed."
-1,It's pretty good but i've used it for only a short period of time and it looks like the strap is already all scratched up. It's not great wear and tear.
1,"They are not as rugged as the OEM products, but at the price they are disposable."
1,"Work great, price great"
-1,"I purchased this antenna and recently was able to compare the ability to receive the marine WX (2 meter) channels with a Nagoya NA-771.<br /><br />The mag mount antenna was placed on the roof of a pick-up truck.  With the mag mount antenna I was only able receive 1 channel loud and clear and 1 other barily audible.<br /><br />The NA-771, which is mounted on the radio was able to receive 6 of the 7 channels loud and clear.<br /><br />I then compared the mag mount with t6he stock UV-B5 antenna ehich also out preformed the mag mount.  I wish I had compared the preformance earlier so I could return this worthless item."
1,"This is a great charger.  It has two ports which will simultaneously charge two Samsung Galaxy 5's.  It has two more ports that are for lower powered units, but I've had mixed results with those (they won't charge the Galaxy, or an older Samsung Rugby, but have charged other USB devices).  I've used the high power ports to charge an IPad 4 as well, no trouble.  It comes with a decent power cord (4-6').  I bought two and use one in my travel kit so that I don't have to swipe the one from home every time I hit the road.  Quite happy with the purchase.  Well worth the money."
1,"Bought it as a replacement for a 928 w/cracked screen.  Since it is not on a verizon network, the hotspot does not work.  Everything else works as expected with my Ting SIM card."
1,Performs exactly as advertised.
1,"The tablet is great. Lollipop is not; yet.  Stay on Kitkat  until  LG puts the upcoming Lollipop update through (5.10). It runs 5.02 right now. If your tablet wants to upgrade from KitKat, learn from my mistake, and dont' let it.. If you install Lollipop before the update, your tablet will &#34;leak&#34; memory. Music stops in the middle of a song (imusic player is Google Play) , keyboards crash making it so you can't type, and apps continually stop and then relaunch, slowing everything down. Trying to have 2 apps open in the same window is useless. I'll post back here once LG puts the update through."
-1,I drop my phone and the screen crack because there is no protection om the edges..... do not buy it cost me $600 for anew  phone
1,"Rec'd phone 20 days after order was entered.  Works on the bands / networks / wifi, as stated. Better than expected battery life.  FM would be better if headphones were not required for antenna and if they used 3.5mm jack instead of micro usb/charge port.  Unit was rec'd 2015-0822 with an OS updated to Kitkat 4.4.2."
1,Quick delivery and met expectations
1,Wore out over time and the white faded but overall good case. Had drop protection unlike other wallet cases.
1,Exceptionally beautiful and make your cellphone usage with too much ease. highly recommended
1,"Charges my phone to 100% Couldn't do without it! Only issue I'm having is that pin charger will not always connect. Otherwise, when it fully charged the phone, it's great!"
-1,Only one worked. Only going to charge does not process data or audio.
1,Strong as expected but a little tight on the rail but fit well after some effort
1,"Works well, not fancy by any account, but I feel that my phone is safer with this thing on. Doesn't help when the phone goes face down on the ice, though."
1,Made a great gift.
1,Fit great...went on easy and was better than half price compared to Verizon!
-1,Works but is the fake no nfc pad like the Google cardboard he probably go the pictures of Google images
1,"My favorite case, and I've tried a few."
1,COOL GROOVY AND FAROUT
1,"Though it is good quality and charges your phone very good. The material is very sleek and easy to fall out of your hand. They should have put a grip on this. Other than that, no complaints. Charges fast, and lasts a very long time."
1,If you are looking for a better quality screen that the cheap ones then buy this. The tools are also much higher quality but you really only need one set.
1,I really like the case. I also feel it really protects my phone. Only reason I give 4 stars is because the &#34;glitter&#34; design is not realistic. Also the protective screen sometimes prevents fast keystrocks.
1,"I love it works great. It is convenient accessory to have, a travel set. You can keep in your car so you can take it with you and leave your permanent charger at home."
1,Yeah
1,Worked perfect for when I was away.
1,"Works perfect with Iphone 5s. Nice to have wallet and phone in one. I replaced the plastic phone case that came with it, with my own hard plastic case which I glued to the leather case."
1,"Fantastic product! I had my bike parked in a bike rack that was near where a tornado was forming. My phone stayed safe and secure with no damage at all. Highly recommend this product. I suggest using a bluetooth headset for music and calls so that the case can be secure. It comes with adjustable foam pads to help you use it, which was a great idea."
1,Does what it says!
1,for a fair review they gave me a discount. love it!
1,"So far, no problems with this item. Can switch to landscape in a pinch, which is a nice perk. Also seems to leave a decent amount of room for the air to flow out of the air vents. Decent price, as well, so yeah, no complaints."
1,Looks great- haven't dropped my phone yet so unsure of protective qualities.
-1,Pay close attention. This is a cheap ballpoint pen with an eraser-sized stylus nub on the other end. No returns acceped.
1,Great
-1,Does not work with an Otterbox case on the phone.
1,Came wrong color
1,Works great.
1,Nice they worked great~A+
1,exactly what I wanted and is slim enough to fit in my purse
1,Exelent! ! !
1,love it
1,Beautiful Product. Thank you
1,This product is exactly as described & what I expected. Arrived on time with no issues.<br />Thank you for your prompt attention.
1,Very Cute case
1,It works!  My phone fell onto the pavement as I was getting out of my car and it caused a dent and broken glass appearance. I freaked out a little until I peeled off this screen protector and there was absolutely no damage to the phone itself. All of the damage was absorbed by the screen protector! Happy!
1,I like very much. Graphics are great. Fits great to my phone. Textured case gives it a nice feel. Would buy it again for sure.
1,"works great, fast delivery"
1,Perfect
1,Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
0,Got the case sooner but I don't see where it is 3 layers more like 2. You get a rubber case that's one and then a plastic  that's 2 where is the 3rd layer....
1,"Cover is okay, it gets dirty pretty quickly."
-1,Not satisfied at all. Broke easily.
1,good product
1,"Works perfect, haven't had any problems and it's been over a month since installed"
-1,lousy product breaks easily and cost just as much to get a replacement.  Not worth it.
1,Works perfectly with my Cyberpower laptop.
1,very pleased with phone
1,Very reasonable price. Seems to be a quality product.
1,"I bought this for my father as he is always leaving his phone places and losing it. He loves that it clips right on his belt and he can always find his phone when he needs it. I purchased the same one for his old phone, and it seemed to slide out of the holster a lot easier than this one does. This one tends to get stuck/take some muscle to slide it out. Also, the kickstand is not easy to pop out, especially for a man who does not have fingernails to dig in and pull it out. It is sturdy and functional, however."
1,Awesome product just as promised and beyond quick shipping!
-1,"I've only had the case for a few weeks and the leather/bumper are already separating...I'm not sure if that's supposed to happen or not. I can see where over time the bottom near the plug will become fragile and break. For someone like me who uses her phone a LOT, this case won't make it. I do like how it has good protection but it's rather bulky...nothing like an Otter box but def increases the size.  The gold and black leather are pretty but I don't think I'll buy this case again. The struggle to find sleek, think, cell phone protection continues."
1,"This tracker is very stylish, I would wear it as an accessory even if it had no function.  But the UP app is also the best app for regular people (read: Not hardcore fitness addicts) It analyses your habits and coaches you do make incremental improvements in your overall health. Yes, the number of steps you take in a day is important, as is working out.  But more and more research shows that lack of sleep can negate many health benefits gained from exercise. What about diet? Up gives all of your meals a food score which is color coded, so you can easily understand the quality of food you are consuming at a glace. While the baked-in food logging is pretty awkward to use, it pairs with myfitnesspal which has the largest database of foods of any app.<br /><br />Overall, the app is a lifestyle and health coach, while its competitors are just fitness trackers.This is a major difference.<br /><br />I love almost everything about this product.  Cons are the food logging  portion of the app, the clasp has come loose a couple times- If you have the band snug (doesn't need to be tight or pinching) on your wrist it will never come off.  But it can get looser with use or activity. Also, the paint on the band gets nicked, which takes away from the classiness of the band.<br /><br />As far as the tapping goes, it just takes some getting used to.  Still not super reliable (sometimes a takes a few tries to get it).  Don't worry about it. By the time you read this it will soon or may already be a thing of the past.  Jawbone has announced that in the next firmware update, they will do away with manual tapping for sleep mode.  Instead, it will now auto-detect sleep (like it's competitors).  I don't know what happens if I want to take a nap."
1,"This case is the bomb! I never had one of these leather wallet cases. I thought they were to big and bulky, especially for the iPhone 6 plus. Let me just say, packaging was awesome (this brand specifically, has nice retail looking packaging. The 3 slits on the side are for single credit cards. I saw some people were sticking 6 credit cards and had some money in the wallet case, and were expecting it to close. Um, no that will not close.<br /><br />For the record, all you really need is 2-3 credit cards on the daily and maybe a $20 bill. No one needs to stuff this case with 6+ credit cards and tons of money. This case is for people on the go. Personally I love it and will probably end up buying the pink one since I have a white iPhone. The leather and overall craftsmanship is great quality. I would purchase this again and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a leather wallet stand case.<br /><br />I received this at discount in exchange for my honest review."
1,"Cables arrived right on time and they work perfect, will certainly be a repeat customer.<br /><br />Thanks Greg"
-1,"There was absolutely NOTHING that I liked about this product.  The design is poor and I never could get the pen to work on my IPad air without constant skips, often my IPad air would not pick up the pen's existence at all.  You will be better off just using your finger."
1,Exactly how I pictured!!!
1,"Nice skin case!<br /><br />This is VERY well made - tight enough not to slip, but not a huge pain to remove to swap batteries.<br /><br />It is far from the thinnest case out there - the Orzly case I have is considerably thinner - but is far from bulky and gives a little more of a sense of security from falls.<br /><br />The seams are smooth and there is just a little bit of a &#34;grippy&#34; feel to it.<br /><br />I recommend this as a solid mid-thickness case, not as unnoticeable as the Orzly, but not as cumbersome as folio or multiple-piece cases."
1,It's long last charge. Also charges quick.
1,great
1,RAVPower charger is great. I have user it many times when going on long hikes and it powers my phone as well as my wifes phone without any problems. I love the availability of two high capacity charging ports. I also charges back up rather quickly with the included charging block and cable.
-1,Cord is thin and already has a shortage. When it works it charges well but when it doesn't it's useless.
1,loved it<br />no problems here
1,Item worked perfectly! No problems at all.
-1,The only problem is that is bronken after four week
-1,Case did not work for my phone.
1,Thrilled with both items. Love the fact that it's compact and able to get a matching color to my Sony Walkman.  Fits nicely in my pocket.
0,"Nice construction, doesn't fit my Rockford Fosgate Punch"
0,"Got this for a buddy in the army after he got back of deployment. It lasted for a year or two then he managed to break it after numerous drops. He did like it however, so I suppose it was worth a few years. Additionally cell phones change so often, who's to say that by the time it fails (if it does) it'll even fit any of the new models?"
-1,some time it does not work to connect the iPhone 6 to the PC.
-1,"These came in the mail today. I tested them by switching out my current headphones with these ones during a conversation with my friend. He said that I sounded further away or like I was really small. So I tried out the second set. He reported the same issue. When I put my current headset back on he said &#34;he could hear me loud and clear.&#34; I've purchased a 2 pack set before, which was equally inexpensive, and was actually the set he could hear me &#34;loud and clear&#34; on. I guess this purchase was from a different seller. The packaging on this set was not the same as my original Samsung headphones were packaged or the last set I purchased. There were no additional earbud sizes and the cord is smaller."
1,"Very efficient service, the part is exactly what I need, no complains."
1,Great combo deal here. Chargers work great and now I don't have to bring the charger in and out of the car to home and back again
1,"This product is a simple yet effective way to charge your devices when the power goes out.  It uses readily available AA batteries and outputs the power to a full size USB port for plugging in various devices.  Keep in mind the amperage output may not be great enough for some tablet devices.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Compact and sturdy<br />- 3 LED lights indicate the amount of power remaining and indicate whether it is charging<br />- With a pack of AA batteries you can power up additional devices (vs having to recharge like a Li-ion charger)<br /><br />Cons<br />- LED lights are very bright and you'll want to cover them up if charging at night (i.e. in a bedroom)<br />- Package with old 30 pin iphone cable (vs newer lightening cable)<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product to use for camping or a power failure."
1,Came in today was brand-new and is the newer type with the flange thank you so much male type  The one in the picture the older one I will try to put a picture up but the new one has the flange it's not all flat like the one in the picture we just got 4 of them in and they were the right ones. New style better thank you so much<br /><br /> We use the  antenna for short distance not long-distance the antenna works well this and made for short distance it is not a long-distance. we use it around the family for short distances...  Thank you for the product .  We have no problems with this product.  If anything changes will update
1,Horrible charging looks very nice and was excited....tried it with several plug connectors and they get hot..phone does not charge//I changed the rating to a four star because I tried one more connector and got the charging speed I was expecting (fast)   What really impressed me was the seller called within 24 hours leaving me a voice mail to assist me in resolving my problem .   Will buy from the seller again without delay because of this.. Also I just love the nylon construction. ~
1,Light weight case perfect for adult use but not recommended for a child's tablet.
1,A bit pricey but SO much better than that little add-on charger piece that is sent with the original device.
-1,Decent case for the price. Much better wallet cases out there
-1,"I'm extremely unimpressed with this product. I found the instructions to be very unclear, disorganized, and very vague, and the kit itself was very difficult to maneuver. I spent over 2 hours trying to put together the screen of my phone, with very little success. Additionally, the glass screen itself is very poor quality, and the display screen is extremely fuzzy. While it is great to be paying a portion of the price to get it fixed in a store, I highly recommend going to a store and paying the extra money to have someone do it for you, this is not worth the time, stress, energy, or risk."
1,"Good item, Fast shipper"
-1,I took forever for me to receive it and it turned out to be broken
1,Nice screen protector
1,"Great quality, arrived on time. Very happy with my purchase"
1,worked
1,"Arrived very quickly, very nice quality.  I would order again."
-1,Piece of crap. I put in the first battery pack and it started smoking.  Per instructions.  Put in the second battery pack per instructions and it didn't power up. What a waste of money.
1,I got the matte for my s6. Works amazing. Highly recommended
1,"While I understand the reasons for giving low ratings for this product, I can't say that I agree with the fact that they are given.  When you buy this mp3 player just know what you're getting into.  It is a very simple interface, simple design, do not expect frills and thrills, but for $25 bucks what do you expect.  I went to Target and Wal-mart to find the cheapest mp3 player possible that had at least mediocre reviews, and the most cost effective one I found that didn't receive total garbage ratings was in the area of $40+ dollars, and it was in area of 3 out of 5 stars with users experiencing similar problems which is not something anyone likes to see.  I will admit that the controls and interface are a bit confusing at first, but nothing that I couldn't figure out after a day or two of use, and while you can toss a sim card in this player, it comes with 16 gigs and if you just use it for music, estimating an average song is about 3 to 5MB, you can fit somewhere in the range of 3,200 to 5,300 songs.  Definitely wouldn't recommend that many though if you're someone who likes to search for a particular song though.  Sound is surprisingly good, and can actually get pretty loud depending on your headphones.  For my own purposes, I get inexpensive mp3 players to take to the gym so its not a big deal if something happens to it and I usually have about 100 to 150 songs at a time so this player for me is perfect.  To sum up, I feel like you get much more than your moneys worth for a very basic product.  Keep your expectations tempered and expect at least a little interface confusion to start.  Personally I'm probably going to buy a couple more in case something happens to the one I have so that I have a backup for when I inevitably drop something heavy on it."
1,Pretty much the perfect cell phone mount for the car. My only complaint is that the &#34;jaw&#34; covers the volume and power button on the Z3C (not a knock against the design otherwise).<br /><br />The knob on the back of the swing arm also seems to come loose easily. But for the price paid it is a small concern.
-1,"I had it for less than a week and it has already stopped charging my device.  Delivery was quick which was great, I just really wish the product still worked."
-1,I would not recommend this cable.  I just recently started using it - probably 2 or so weeks now - and the fabric covering is falling off the cord. Not worth it.
1,"Great case that is low profile and quite protective.<br /><br />Four star because the buttons on the side end up sticking out. I bought this case to replace a bulkier protective one, and I found that the button would get pressed enough to shut my phone off in my pocket. if there were little less material on the buttons, or even just holes to allow the buttons to be flush or recessed with the case, it'd be better."
-1,"Definitely agree with some other reviews. Case DOES NOT fit snug. Issue is more or the sides not staying. One side stays, they other side does not wrap around phone."
1,This case is very well made and I will definitely be using it often! Has a great seal and a beautiful color. I won't worry about having it near the pool or taking it to the amusement park.
1,Came as advertised. My daughter has the pink iPhone 5c and she loves it!
1,love!!!!
1,"I have purchased 4 of these now. Two in silver, one in black and now this one. These are THE best!!  Three of these are gifts. One is for myself.  I highly recommend these for anyone who is considering buying these. They hold their charges if you do not need them right away and when you do need them, they charge your electronics quickly and effectively.  Do not hesitate in purchasing these."
1,Great price
1,"I received this camera lens by GoGo Robots to review and I love it. I take so many pictures with my cell phone that this really comes in handy. I love the multi functionality of the lens. It helps with wide angles, like panoramic shots, micro shots and fisheye effect shots. It is really easy to use. Just clip it on the camera of your smart phone, I have the iPhone 6 plus and I have it in an otterbox, this lens fits just fine over my case. There is no need to take the case off and risk damaging your phone. It works just fine!  I like how easy it is to take on and off. Literally just clip it on and then unclip it off. It comes with a convenient carry case that fits in your pocket with no hassle. This is a great gift for any of your family or friends that love to post on instagram. It is also a great gift for teens that use a lot of social media. I love to have it on me when I am out with my kids because it does improve the pictures that I take with my phone. The lens comes with a 30 day money back guarantee, with no questions asked. It is awesome!"
1,My daughter loves this case.  Looks like it costs much more than 10.00!  Keeps phone protected.
1,"This is super cute, but the tail falls off. We attached a large cardboard to the inner side so it wouldn't slip out as easily."
-1,it broke in 3 days
1,Its ight
1,"works across any phone which supports the shutter function with a volume button.<br />Apple, Xiaomi and Samsung worked flawlessly.<br />nice sleek and classy design, no cheesy colors.<br /><br />minor gripe about the swivel holding the camera as it felt loose...<br />but nothing some epoxy didn't fix.<br />great value for the price and with a free gift too, thanks!!"
-1,I received the product and not happy about it. I didn't receive the earpiece. What a waste of time.
1,i like the product
1,Good case
-1,This was a total let down. I bought this case for safety on a float trip and did the test that the product instructed to make sure it wasn't defective. Everything seemed fine until we went on the trip.  Half way through the trip I looked at the phone and two inches of water was inside the case. The phone won't turn on at all and the camera lense is all fogged up. I'm devestated. Now I have to go through the trouble of seeing if my carrier will cover the damage when this case is what is at fault.
1,Very clear sound with great range.
1,"Otterbox, need I say more, fits great, excellent product"
1,Works great!
1,Excellent Thank You..
1,Great cover! It works and looks perfectly on my iphone 6.
1,GOOD PRODUCTS
-1,"I don't know how others are claiming this is an easy install. It's frustrating, messy, and the little tabs don't stay down on the edges. I've installed plenty of dry screen protectors on devices, I've become quite good at it. This protector requires way more work than what a screen protector should. Yes, I watched the video, sprayed my fingertips, continuously squeegied and sprayed and squeegied and slid the protector around. It just kept rising off the face of the watch around the edges and wasn't getting any better as it dried. Steer clear of this crap. Wasted both protectors that it came with, immediately issued a refund."
1,I just got the cover and it looks exactly like the picture I really like but I think that after a few weeks this image is gonna peel off  maybe
1,Does what is supposed to
1,Wife loves it!
1,Just what I was looking for. Great product for a great price!
1,great item
1,Very cute..
-1,"Charges intermittently after 95% charge. Charging stops-starts again-stops again. Very annoying and distracting when the phone screen lights up, dims and goes off only to repeat the cycle all over again. Takes a very long time to reach 100%."
1,Best screen protector for the price. Has saved my phone more than once!
1,The cable works great and was what I had hoped and expected.  Great product.  No complaints.
1,"Use this item for various things.  Have one mounted to hold a GO Pro in various situations, a security camera, and a GPS in a RZR.  This is the shorter size and hold items very securely and takes up the least amount of room of the double socket arms.  I also use the longer double socket arms where more length is needed, but I find this length to be the most useful for my needs.  Really like the adjustability that the double socket ends gives you. Use this with a Ram Tough Claw and your mounting possibilities are nearly endless."
1,OEM unit.  same that comes with many phones.<br />sounds decent. pretty comfortable.<br />good value.
1,Very nice. A little bulky.
-1,Horrible.. Sounded terrible.. Buds did not work
1,"Sound quality through the radio can't get any better. Distortion can occur, just remember to turn down the device volume and use the car's volume adjustment."
1,"Great product, does what needs to be done"
-1,Sound quality not as stated.  Great outward design but functional quality needs improvement.
1,Love it
1,nice3
-1,This case is not what I had I mind it is water proof though and that's the best thing I can not hear my callers at all the screen protector is silicone so when you put it on your phone daily you have to work bubbles out
1,Was definitely great quality. I fixed my wifes phone now everybody wants me to fix theirs however i didn't see any instructions so I had to watch a few videos on how to properly get the job done.
-1,"I was looking for a screen protector with some aesthetic appeal and that would cover edge-edge. This was easy to apply and looks good, especially on my black phone. However, between 1 - 2 weeks after application, the top left corner cracked without any obvious insult to the phone (I just had it in my pocket). I like the idea of tempered glass screen protectors and oleophobic coating (it was easier to keep clean than the iPhone screen itself), but it has to survive without serious breakage for at least a few months..."
1,Installed surprisingly easy opposed to other screen protectors I have used.  It is the first ArmorSuit screen protector I have used. I installed the screen protector over a cracked screen hoping it will extend the life of the phone a few months.
-1,"Within the first week I lost two screws, the material that covered the ports started ripping/tearing and EVERYONE had a hard time hearing me if I talked in any position other than by my hand (i.e. my sholder). I really thought I'd found a great cover but I wish I hadn't wasted the ! $."
-1,This product did not fit my phone and it was the correct model.
1,"The Rankie cords are the perfect replacement for the the original product received with my pc tablet and smart phone.  My foster puppy has chewed through every cord while the devices are being used or charged. After a few bad purchases, I finally got what I needed.<br /><br />I mistakenly purchased similar cords from another vendor and although they seemed to be made well, the thickness of the cord made it stiff.  It affected the connectivity in a negative way as the cord could not bend at the connection point for consistent contact. Nothing worse than to find the tablet had no juice hours later.  This happened all the time and so irritatingly inconvenient.  Also, I mistakenly ordered the wrong length of cord and that vendor would not allow a return for exchange...and that item cost more than these.<br /><br />Rankie customer service offers service AND replacement or exchange!  The connection point on my devices are not damaged by a poor fit by a unbending cord also.  Why didn't I find these cords first!"
1,This item more than met my expectations.  GREAT VALUE for the price.
1,Great fit love the color. I'm hoping you guys come out with more feminine colors SOON! I love that the side buttons (volume/power) are all flush to the case and don't pop out. They work perfect. Definitely feel like it will protect my Galaxy Edge Plus. Loving the kick stand.  Thanks so much!
-1,"TechSkin for Note Edge was great, but for S6 Edge+, it was a mess. Cut-out holes aren't exactly where it should be and both edges won't stick."
1,Very Good
-1,"Initially, I would have given this a great review as it went on very well and was indeed very clear.  HOWEVER, they said that the sections that had a wavy appearance would disappear after a few days.....they didn't.  I can live with that, BUT it was impossible to keep clean.  Every single touch leaves noticeable marks on the phone and needs cleaned constantly.  Even that could almost be tolerable for good protection, but now, about 2 weeks after I put it on, it just lifted off.  I would not recommend this product.  Very disappointed."
0,"great idea, it works well with the stand and all and it's very cute, however, it does not cover the screen properly! the first time I dropped my phone in this case, it landed on the corner and shattered my screen!"
-1,Clip broke off after two months ! Have to purchase another Case from a better Manufacture.
0,"While I do love the durability of this case (I've had a Lifeproof case for several years) something has changed in the last year or two.  They are VERY helpful when it comes to warranty claims so I've stuck it out but I just filed another claim on this case I purchased 5 weeks ago!  My last three cases have the same problem.  The film that covers the flash is torn in a U shape.  I've tried to figure out how this keeps happening and I am treating my phone more carefully than I do when it has no cover.  This case is replacing a case I bought in May.  The camera cover is more durable than the flash cover (which is the same material used for the thumb print detection).  I've not had any problems with the thumb button tearing and I'm unclear on why they need a more flexible cover on the flash.<br /><br />I have this case so I don't have to worry if my kids drop my phone in the pool, tub or toilet but having to replace it every 5 weeks is not really worth it.  Sad to see such a design flaw in an otherwise good case."
-1,I GOT IT FOR MY SON'S IPHONE 5C AND HE HAS TO TAKE THE CASE OFF EVERY TIME HE CHARGES IT.  HE JUST DOESN'T USE IT ANYMORE.
1,works great
1,Perfect!! Fits nicely and allows me to access all the features while exercising or simply needing to have my phone accessible while I do chores around the house.
1,Easy install and NO BUBBLES!
-1,Half star really... convenient I think not cool idea bad execution.
1,I love this case! Ships fast and is very stylish 😻 keeps your phone secure. Isn't bulky feeling or feels like it's too much. Feels very slim and fits the phone perfectly.
1,L o v e it. Has lots of room. Good quality. Fast shipping. Good packing.
1,"Excellent case! I have dropped my phone quite a few times in this and my phone is still like new! A little dirty around the edges, but still looks nice and protects my phone, which is my main purpose of using this case!"
1,"Very handy and useful, just took a while to install but after that its been smooth sailing."
1,A simple cable to add flashdrive support to an older 1st gen Xbox. It plugs into a controller port. Worked just fine. I ordered from STA Online and it was shipped from China. Arrived in just 1-1/2 weeks. Very satisfied.
1,impeccable quality and design.. Thanks.
-1,Nice case feels good it's just that the magnet will make the gps go crazy.
-1,"Just ridiculous material,  you are paying for nothing"
1,Fits watch perfectly. Nice feel. Looks like the original. I will buy again in another color.
1,"Love it,"
1,"I grabbed this speaker so that I would be able to take to the beach with me and use my MP3 player while sitting in the sand. For its purpose the speaker worked great. It is very clear, easy to use and holds a charge long enough to enjoy it for a few hours.If you need a good little speaker to take with you on the go I recommend grabbing this little guy! This product was given to me at a discount in exchange for an honest and accurate review.<br /><br />-H"
1,It does its job and beautifully fit.
1,Great deal for an inexpensive screen protector!
1,What a great product! Charges on cloudy days as well although obviously takes longer. It is durable as well having accidentally left it in the rain one day. My son-in-law fell in love and bought one as well.
1,Good
1,In exchange for a fair review they gave me a discount. I LOVE this company. Love the products that I purchased!
1,Better than pictured.
1,Updated: This plug did fit my iPhone 5c (make sure to remove the phone from the case as this may prevent the plug from going all the way in) and it fits the iPad 4th Gen. This plug is thicker than the OEM Apple lightning charger and this is why it did not fit my iPhone initially while it was in the case.
1,Great service and great product
1,"Came ahead of schedule absolutely love it! fits my phone great. Added a dust charm, definitely will shop with them again."
1,"Case provides excellent coverage with access to all ports. Grip ridges on the sides give a firm feel when holding since the phone can be slippery without it. Not too thin or thick, fits in & out of a belt holster case with ease! Folsom is a trusted brand, can't beat the quality especially for the price! Color is richer lime green in person which is a plus!"
1,Purchased one months ago. Liked so much I purchased a second.
1,Awesome case. very durable and easy to put on. I recommend 100%. Bless yourselves with the fantastic case guys.
1,"The materials are top-notch quality, the connectors are solid, and the cable is lightweight. Oh, and it looks really nice, too. In my experience, you cannot go wrong with Anker lightning cables. They're just terrific products."
1,Simply plug into your QI compliant phone and you can use wireless charging block station insread a plug-in charger. Quicker and ensures phone stays charged.
1,Very good product for a reasonable price. Very easy to install and does an excellent job.
1,satisfied
1,"This cell phone holder is super east to use! It comes with 2 magnets stickers for your phone. I stuck it to the back of my phone under the case, but next time I would stick it to the inside of the case. This is much more user friendly than the kind that you have to adjust brackets to fit your phone, all you have to do is set it on the base and it sticks. I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, but I would definitely pay full price for this product."
1,Great
1,Great looking durable case
1,"Well made product. Arrived on time. Works great,"
0,"After having this for about a month, I can say it is both low quality and practical. The design is nice and I like the rubber around it. It isn't easy to put on the phone and even irritating after awhile. One part still doesn't latch and starts coming apart.<br /><br />It's average but does the job."
-1,The screen looked great but when I placed my finger on one area it would click on a different area. This is the second screen I have had trouble with.
-1,"Not bad, the back case material is too slick and the case is a bit bulky.  The kick stand is a nice addition but not enough to overcome the slickness of the case.  I went with the Incipio instead and it was half the price."
1,Works like it supposed to. Good quality!
1,"This is a great phone case/clip. It's lasted me since Oct. 2014. I work as a manager in a quick-service restaurant, so the fact that it's lasted that long is a surprise to me. The case is still fine, but the holster is what broke when I ran into the side of a door casing. :-/<br /><br />The only negative that I could think of is that the holster does not hold the phone tight enough to have it held sideways. The phone sort of just drops into it. There is some retention, but not much.<br /><br />It's great in every other way, it's light, doesn't block anything on the phone, and doesn't add much to the phone as far as dimensions go."
1,It works great for my Barned &Noble nook. I've been using it more than a year and there were no problem .<br />Good product with good price.
-1,This battery is not new in any way. Manufactured in 2012. Received and installed only to find it had 500+ charge cycles and the capacity had dropped to almost 50%.
1,My wife loves these. I guess it's saved her screen when she dropped her phone.
1,Better battery performance than the OEM Samsung batteries.
1,Fast shipping. Product great
1,"I was looking for a way to charge my devices while out on long weekend camping without access to any electric, and this has delivered exactly what I needed!!!  Simple, and easy to use.  Just charge it until all the led's light up, and it's ready to go!  Plug your phone etc. in with your USB cord and before you know it they are fully charged!  Very sturdy construction, and even after charging my iPhone(which was almost dead), it still showed a full charge!!!"
-1,This phone only for talk and text. You can't  save  anything because it's not enough storage or download anything! You can't even get picture messages!!! This phone is crap!!!!
1,Great product.
1,The screen protector came with good instructions and a good little squeegee. It was easy to put on and didn't make a lot of air bubbles
1,"Good design, and worked perfectly for expanding the USB ports in our car, as well as in our camper. Getting two units with two ports each was what we needed. The only downside is that they seemed to charge a little slower when both ports were being used. I'll have to do some test on it to see if that was just perception or reality, but either way, it wasn't a deal breaker. Great job!"
1,"Item arrived on time and in good condition. No extreme complaints about item quality except battery charge is often difficult to gauge.<br /><br />The only way to tell how well charged the the headset is, you must turn it on, and a voice will tell you &#34;Battery High&#34;, or &#34;Battery Medium&#34;, etc. It'd be more helpful if it had a better gauge like on a cell phone to inform me just how much &#34;medium&#34; is, since it seems to be a variable between only a couple hours to a whole day's worth of charge.<br /><br />But that's a very small issue. Just make sure it's plugged in at the end of the day and this headset will last the entirety of the next."
1,I am addicted to these!
1,Nice phone!
1,Nice case. Fit like a glove!
1,Pretty good
1,Received as pictured. Works good.  I would buy again.
1,Comfortable and holds phone securely.  Got this one because of the handy pocket inside for keys/cards works great.
1,Works well. On time.  Only problem I have is answering the phone. Can't hear the caller unless it's on speakerphone. Everything else is loud enough
1,Great use it alot
1,good
1,"While USB-C is not a brand new port type, it has recently become popular with the emergence of the new Apple MacBooks.

0,Somewhat flimsy
1,great
-1,After the install there were grid linpv
1,Does not come with a regular size SD holder so you can put it in a card reader.  Lucky I had an old one.
-1,I can't connect my new head set to my phone which is the Samsung Note 3. I Have followed the directions numerous times after fully charging the head set.
1,"I like the watch strap and ordered it in black. I wish the strap itself were a bit thicker. I have the watchsport space gray and bought separately the pieces to change the color to space gray where it hooks to the watch. However, the buckle for the watch is still bright steel, which I wish was also darker."
0,Case started coming apart within lik a week and I did not even use it for a month
1,I still use the case amd headphones and stylus and i actually was glad i bought it or my ipod would be broke by now
1,"If I could give this a ten star rating I would!  This case is so worth every penny!  My daughter had this case on her Samsung Galaxy in a different color but same product.  She left it on the roof of her car and drove off.  A few blocks away she heard something fall and looked in her review mirror and saw her phone hitting the ground and breaking into pieces.  She was going approximately 30 to 35 mph.  She pulled over and retrieved the parts.  The phone case itself came apart in two pieces.  The backing came off and the frame also had separated. The back cover to her phone had popped off and the battery came out.  She collected all the pieces and put her phone back together.  To her amazement the phone still was in perfect working condition and there was only a tiny scratch on the corner of the phone.  The phone case backing did break and was unusable, but she could still put the phone case frame back on her phone.  We ordered another one of these cases.  This clearly is a superior product and we are very happy with the results!!!!!  It is recommended that you don't leave your phone on top of your car!  This case is sturdy and protects and cushions your phone."
1,"Just recently purchased an iPhone 6 + and encapsulated it within Spigen' grasp. Great feel, great fit, protection yet to experience. Time will tell."
1,Very Well. Thx.
1,"Very surprised with the audio quality!  Based on some of the other reviews, I was expecting a slight decrease in overall fidelity and bass.  Believe it or not, the audio is richer and &#34;bassier&#34; when using this receiver.  I can't tell you how happy I am with this.  My 2007 Volvo S60 has a 3.5mm mini-port in the middle armrest compartment.  Therefore, it was always a pain to plug my iphone using a cord - and recently, it wouldn't even stay seated in my iphone due to the case I was using.  This has completely solved all of my problems and updates my car with current technology.  I just need to figure out how to disable phone calls from running through this since I prefer to keep that localized to my phone."
1,"Works as intended, great product.  2012 WRX."
-1,the radio  still  does  not work  with it
-1,This product arrived looking used and the material was all marked. Very disappointed that for this small product what I must go through to get a refund.After I purchased it I also saw them at the local store for 50% less of what I paid.
1,"Installed this unit in my 2005 Ford Mustang replacing stock Shaker 500 system.  Am quite satisfied with the performance and features of the unit for the price.  I added the Sirius XM tuner which plugs directly into the Jensen unit - no fuss here.  Overall, the Jensen vx7020 is a nice technology upgrade and an easy way to modernize my 10-year old car.  Used the recommended Metra wiring harness, mounting kit and 12v-to-5v power filter.  As others mentioned, the mounting kit did NOT include screws, so I had to scrounge the garage for self tapping short screws to make that work.  Backup camera for $15 is the real treat here!  The unit supports backup camera display when car is shifted into reverse.  This was worth the effort to upgrade and install alone.  It does not have backup sensors to warn of approaching objects, but the visual is a great and frankly unexpected addition."
1,Good quality. Great price.
1,"Fits my galaxy alpha perfectly and is easy to apply, also came with alcohol pad and micro fiber cloth to clean screen before applying."
1,The feel of the screen is just perfect and any grease or mark goes off with ease. The size of the screen is exact but make sure you place it right. Would have liked it if it there were just a little more copies of the tools that you need to stick the screen onto your phone.<br /><br />Caution: Be extremely careful with the alignment!
0,"Product came on time, and looked great! Unfortunately the kicker was too big."
1,"Been using this with no real issues, stays in place, very simple and works as expected.  Only downside is the phone (iPhone 5s with very light case) tends so slope down from the weight.  But still works fantastic in my car setup.  Purchased a 2nd one for my wife."
1,These wires are very durable and a great value!
-1,Mine stopped working after a few weeks.  Amazon lost my return so I am out 10 bucks.  Stay away.
-1,My arm is not super skinny but I am petite and this does not stay on my arm bc there is not enough velcrow when I wrap it.
-1,They are not so good!
1,"Love it!  It's not as detailed as the picture online, though.  The owls aren't as pronounced, but I still like it!"
0,"ease of use is the best thing, but sometimes the sound is not good."
1,Dropped my phone from the attic door about 15 ft and it was fine! Thanks Cell Bee!
1,"Good looking product. Too thin to protect from drops, but good enough for basic scratch protector. Very thin product. Port covers off great feature."
1,Great charger. Replaced the need for rotating different cables for different devices. Everything stays plugged in.
1,"Excellent case, excellent price."
-1,crap. broke after a week
1,"I Got The My Case , I Really Love The Color And The Look It Has To My Phone . i Also Love How Quick It Came In The Mail😍😍😊"
1,Happy
1,Pretty awesome. Holds phone very well and you don't have that band across the front face.
1,Works great.
-1,Was very unhappy with it. The phone Holder was torn at the top by the closure so it wasn't able to be used.
-1,"Pros:<br />Attractive<br />Does not add bulk to Phone<br />Wireless charging still works.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Does not provide addaquete protection.<br /><br />I was using this case plus a tempered glass screen protector. A drop from 3 feet struck the corner. When I pucked up the phone the front and glass back were fine but the rear camera lens was shattered. Nothing struck the lens directly. While the front and back glass (being Gorilla Glass) may be tough enough to permit a slim case, the camera lens on the Note 5 simply requires a case that absorbs more inpact to keep the camera from breaking."
1,Thought it was going to have a pocket but it doesn't but it works well
1,Purchased two of these cable for our iPhones and they work like a charm.  Very pleased with the purchase.
1,Good deal
1,love it perfect thank you.
1,"This was a SAMPLE case that was sent to me for testing / review. I simply love these cases and appreciate the workmanship and design. They are not Bulky, they are nice and slim. The fact that the back can be interchanged with a different color is a big plus because after a while, everyone likes change, the gray and gold look pretty good as well. The Buttons are nice and accessible and the openings are sufficient for camera, charging port and the headphone jack. Would I recommend this? Yes I had purchased one of these for my Galaxy S5 because of the quality."
-1,"Charger will not fit with case on unless it is the original charger that came with phone. I have only had the case for a month or less, it has already started falling apart, cheap plastic"
1,Wonderful
1,"Sounds good, backup works well, like it.<br />The bad:<br />Backup does not work while reading ad card.<br />Cannot adjust settings while playing music.<br />Display does not dim when night falls."
0,"Good kit, but their customer support is still aggravating"
-1,Broke almost immediately.
1,"Belkin makes great products - this charging cable is no exception: Durable, with a fast charge and easy to use. I really love the 90 degree angle on this cable = for me it keeps the cable away from my immediate worksite and allows me more freedom to move around."
1,"Looks great, works great, fits great, plus a great price."
1,loved that the case came with screen protector!
1,Very secure and protective for my Galaxy s5 active. Clip works great and a belt loop when more security is needed.
1,"We got our phones at the same time and I bought a Sahara case and my wife some other brand. Mine is still in perfect condition and hers is is falling apart. We just got a Sahara case for her iPhone 6. Fits perfectly, the glass shield is easy to apply with no bubbles underneath Fter installation. A good well priced product that meets the claims of the manufacturer."
1,So cute.....  I get compliments... It's super soft.... Doesn't really protect your phone if you drop it...
-1,Never buy again . Only use one day and broken
1,"Perfect for what I needed. The back under the clip isn't protected and gets wet from sweat, but no phone issues because if it."
1,It works as advertising.
-1,Weight of phone drags down vent. In my van it gave me no angle to see it reasonably. Returned
1,One star deduction for my own effort to file a small notch on the armband case to be able to fully insert my earpod jack on the phone. Completely satisfied with the rest.
1,As advertised
1,Fit perfect. Works great.
1,These seem solid and work well so far.
1,Great wallet Will buy again
1,"This was easy to install, but I'm disappointed in the fit.  I ordered the same shield for my husband's Galaxy S5 and that had a perfect fit.  This does not even completely cover the screen."
1,Fast. Quality product.
-1,String broke off and case is not sturdy at all
-1,My iPhone 6 never fit into this case!
-1,The phone does not recognise the sim card.
-1,"It didn't work.  Purchased it to use with a credit card reader since my phone's case is too big for the reader to seat properly.  When I plugged it in, my phone recognized that something was in the headphone jack, but the program for using credit cards didn't recognize that it was connected.  I removed my case and tried the reader alone, and it worked just fine, but not when using the adapter."
1,"I installed this in the clear &#34;box&#34; that the charging back for my Samsung came in. It works really great. The only minor issues I have are that the clear box allows the LED to be a bit too bright for right beside the bed, and the clear plastic that I used doesn't have any way to align the phone with the charger. That's a design flaw on my part, but it works well enough that I haven't felt a huge rush to fix either issue."
1,"This thing is great for traveling, especially if you've got a family with lots of devices"
1,"So far they have been wonderful.  Over time it will be tested.  I walk normally everyday and use them, will try to repost after 6 month"
1,Long cord is a plus
1,It protect against falls and other mishaps one might experience while in your possession.
1,LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. Best thing I've ordered off of amazon
-1,Expect what you pay for. It doesn't last very long
1,product is as advertised
-1,This is NO way shape or form fits the Galaxy S6 phone!!  Waste of time and money
1,"Fast set up and easy to use, Very high quality sound."
1,"I've put several screen protectors on cells phones over the years and none have turned out well except these.  So far this screen cover is taking a licking and is protecting my LG screen wonderfully.  The sheet was easy to apply and I had no problems.  With the sheets you also get a lens cloth and scrapper.  The instructions are clear.  For the price you just cannot beat it.  Coupled with the ASHIELD Protective Case and Holster (Gray/Orange), I am confident my phone can withstand the normally brutal handling I typically inflict upon my phones."
1,Got these for my wife because I liked the blue pair a lot. She likes them but hardly wears them because she uses her iPad speaker more often to listen to music out loud.
1,Good case very thin. I only didn't like how when my phone  was in my jeans I took it out and the edges are turning blue and it won't come off. Overall good case.
1,"Excellent cell phone case! Very attractive- sleek design with magnet closure, and protective too! Case is just slightly bulkier than I imagined, but I am very happy with the product!"
1,good
0,"Another review said there was a bit of extra space at the top and bottom of the rubber insert...it does indeed seem too big. The phone is not in danger of falling out, not even close, but it is noticeable when handling the top or bottom of the phone when the insert gives a little."
1,"Could have been thinner, but still pleased. Blue matches picture, holds a few cards and or cash. Clasp slightly block the power button vs clasp less design (non wallet) I had before, but is reasonable.<br /><br />The whole thing would have been nicer if thinner.<br /><br />Note the clasp on mine is square, not beveled if that is a concern."
1,well fit
-1,This adapter barely works.  Only about 25% of the song comes through.  I had to buy three more before getting one that worked.
1,"I bought this AC charger because it is UL listed.  A UL listing means that the design and manufacture both meet safety standards for protection against shock or fire.  If your adapter is not UL listed it could shock you or damage your phone/ipad/mp3 player.  A listed product has a UL file number printed on it. Verify the listing by looking it up on the UL website.  Listing by CSA, TUV, VDE, or ETL are just as good as UL.  Unfortunately, a CE mark means nothing as far as safety. BTW, this charger works great !"
1,The only thing I can say is That I now have a VERY HAPPY WIFE with this case and protector. It looks good and does not block the screen corners when she is playing her games on her new Samsung Galaxy tab S.  She is happy and I am happy. Thank God!
1,"Haven't dropped the phone to really test out the case, but it certainly seems rugged.  The texture makes it easier to keep a good grip on the phone."
1,"works as intended, with no issues"
1,Great
1,"The colors on the case are not as vivid as they appear online, it's more burgundy and green than red and silver.  That aside, the case is sturdy and the design is elegant.  It is a good compliment to my new phone."
-1,Bad product broke faded donot buy.waste of  money I had to gave it n star donot  deserve  that
1,"Came in ahead of time, fits perfectly"
1,"Great product, last as long as the OEM battery"
1,This thing charges my iPad and iPhones FAST!  Great charger...1
-1,Protector cracked in less than 2 days...wtf
1,"Arrived sooner than expected, was exactly as described, and I love it."
1,This one I bought for my mom.She seems to like it
0,I like how it is retractable but the cord is small and comes off the track too often.  Perfect for someone at a desk
1,I used this to replace the screen on my cracked HD7 Kindle.  It was cheaper than a new kindle and the tools and youtube walk through and it was fixed 30 minutes later.  My kids and my wallet were pleased.
1,"AAA+ Seller & great product, highly recommended for Gen1"
-1,windows phones are horrible
1,"This case is an exceptional deal.  It fits our iPhone 6 and 5. I bought 3 of them for my family for vacation at the beach.  You can still make calls, text, and take photos while protecting your phone from sand and water. It comes with a cord to hand the phone around your neck...we vacationed in Europe and the case with the cord was extra protectioon from pickpockers.  The case is easy to use and will protect hour phone from water and spills.  A great product!"
-1,"This product sucks<br /> The part that flips open so you can charge your phone is a. Hard to open the first few times as and then it breaks off. And if you accidentally drop it it's busts open. Save yourself the trouble and shell out a little extra for a real life proof. I now have my s6 sitting in rice praying that the few seconds it was in water bc of this case, does work. Very very disappointed, I never once have ever given a bad review I always find the good in a product. I just can't with this one"
1,The cover is very nice and sturdy.<br />The clips holds it too snug and it is hard to take it out.
1,Love
-1,The case broke within weeks. I did not drop the phone just broke near the vibrating switch hole.
1,my favorite case.
-1,"Cracked plastic on lightning connector after less than a month, very poor quality."
1,"This case is awesome. I picked up one in yellow and the shade is exactly what was pictured. Feels great in my hand and the rubber wrapping around the front is firmly and snugly on there. I was even able to fit three of my cards in the back: license, debit and school id. Just feels cool to know I don't have to carry a wallet with me when I go to the gym."
1,"I love this iPhone 6 case! I get many compliments on the periwinkle color, too!!"
1,Not as good as t I thought.
1,"Very easy to put on and so far it has worked better than the one i got from verizon which cracked first day and i didn't even hit anything, probably won't even need to use the other 2. Thank you"
-1,My case broke in 2 places the first day.  It broke in two more places during the 1st week.  This is a very cheap phone case.  I wouldn't recommend buying it because it won't protect your phone at all.  I didn't even use it for a full week before tossing it in the trash.  Waste of money.
1,Fit my phone perfectly and isn't that bulky doing it...
1,Always good to have a backup screen saver
1,"I have been using this for about a month with no problems.  Installation was easy as this is a slightly thicker protector than flimsy plastic ones, so it had some mechanical strength for easier application. The surface does get dirty, as I would expect, but it is easy to clean.  Finally, I have had no issues with screen sensitivity with the protector in place.  Everything works fine."
1,I'd's everything I wanted - not sure how to store the pen. I get a lot of comment on it. One friend went online as I showed it off an bought one. Nice quality.
1,"I love this case. Very thin and shows off the very cool gun metal backing on the phone. You can hardly tell it's on at all.The only reason for the four stars is that it came emblazoned with &#34;made in China&#34; all over it. It isn't a big deal breaker issue for me, but if that matters to you, consider that."
1,These Radios work good. I ordered 2 sets of radios. One of the radios had a lot of intermittent static. I returned it and the new ones work great.
1,Even better than I expected
1,"Great product, fast shipping."
1,"I was looking for a pause button, this only had the volume which is also nice. But, with kids you use pause a lot."
1,"Works well, very happy."
1,Exactly what I expected at a fair price plus delivery speed was exceptional...thamks
1,"Great price on this phone, lots to learn"
1,Goood
1,Easy transaction with quick delivery. 2 of the 3 were excellent. There was a quick resolve to the one that did not fit. Replacement was very good. Thank you.
-1,I thought this battery would be like a new battery however it has not performed as one.  I followed the instructions on charging and have found within the weeks I have used it that the charge does not hold any longer than the prior battery.  If I would have known this I would have kept the battery I was previously using.  Very disappointed.
-1,My first order was a product that simply did not work.  They resent me the product and only one USB outlet work.  I am stuck with it now.  I am not happy about it at all.  The price point of this product makes it useless to fight any further about it.
-1,Didn't even have this screen protector on for more than a day and dropped my phone and both the protector and my screen shattered. Would not recommend this product at all!!
1,"Finally a way to manage all of the cords for all the devices.  We have 2 kindles, 1 iPad, 1 iPhone, and 1 iPod plugged in and they are all charging!"
1,"Works just like it should, buttons on the side are a little difficult to push with it on though."
-1,Input broke really quickly.
-1,"Strap broke within a week, will retry to return it."
1,"[[VIDEOID:543e99d2c8200fc8a74415450499712e]]I got this stereo for my husband's truck (1997 T-100) because he was LONG overdue for a stereo in there. His was garbage. For the price, this stereo has a LOT of bang for your buck! This is the first touch-screen stereo we've ever owned and it was a lot of fun to play with for the first time. It's got tons of great features. My husband can easily pair his phone's wifi to the system and play whatever he's got on it or use it for hands-free calling(always a plus, safety first!!), or use the av aux input jacks in the back to connect his ipod. It has a cd AND dvd player! That was a HUGE plus for us. My husband likes the option to be able to watch a movie in his truck while at work. The resolution is good and it's got a nice picture. The touchscreen makes it easy to navigate, simple interface, extremely user friendly. It was a volume knob which is a plus. It's easy to turn up or down while driving without taking your eyes off the road. It also has a remote control, which is neat, but I am just hoping my husband doesn't lose it as it's somewhat small. I will probably install Velcro on it so that'll attach to the dash. I like everything about it other then one thing, I wish it had an aux input in the front. But, that's not a deal breaker for us at all. Just a small inconvenience. I highly recommend this system. Just make sure you know whether your car is a double din before ordering. I wanted this system in my 200 Cadillac Escalade, but I was bummed to be informed by my husband that it's a 1.5 din. so I would have to do some modifications. I was bummed! Oh well. My husband is happy with it and it's perfect for him and his truck! I would definitely recommend this double din touchscreen stereo by Pyle!<br /><br />(I was thrilled we were offered the opportunity to purchase this stereo for our use and evaluation at a reduced, promotional price in exchange for our honest and unbiased review)"
1,everything I ordered was awesome. grill mat wasn't as large as it looked
1,It's a stylus.
1,Works fine.
0,It might work for you.  It is large enough to fit most of the new cell phone styles.  Clips onto Vent snugly.
0,This product is ok and it serves it's purpose.
1,WAS VERY NICE. BUT I ORDERED WRONG ONE AND RETURNED THIS.
1,Works great! Only took my brother 30 minutes to put in! Definitely happy with this product!
1,"i like it, but i thought that the case would connect to the phone like the expensive phone cases. oh well"
1,Super quick charger!!!
1,Great Product!
1,Ordered two and I got them way before my expected delivery date! They are stylish and fit perfectly I love them! The band that they come with is useless to me.
-1,"It came with no instructions on how to use the Bluetooth remote. I finally figured out how to use it and then found out the remote was broken, it did not work at all. The selfie stick isnt as good as they said it was. I put my phone in the place was supposed to be and it kept swiveling around. I am very unsatisfied with my purchase."
-1,Poorly made
1,Fits good. Thank you.
0,"It's ok. Looks nice, and for the watch it works great.<br />But there's nothing to hold on to the iPhone charger chord. Just a giant hole. I thought it would be more like a docking station that holds the charger up so that when I put my phone in its inserted. Nope.<br />I'd return it if I didn't toss the box."
-1,Started out working fine. Charged phone and iPad. Then iPad stopped charging and two nights ago phone said it was not compatible. Now i have three cords that work on nothing. I got about a months use out of them. On the bright side they were cheap and fast delivery!
1,"Great product &amp; awesome price! Fast shipping, product was as pictured and as described in the description."
1,"Works great !  No complaints.  I give it 4 stars because the phone, while on the kickstand, slides if you touch it, and when the phone vibrates it moves around; the phone could fall off the desk or table.  The end of the kickstand (the leg) really needs a rubber boot on the end of the kickstand so that it will not slide around. I have no idea why there is even such a thing as the stylus; completely useless since there is nowhere to store it. I received the product in a reasonable amount of time. I am very satisfied with this product.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it will not fit my new Samsung Galaxy S3. I would most definitely purchase this item again, if this company had one that would fit my S3, I would certainly buy it !!"
1,"I liked everything about his product....the case, the color are all on point, but I noticed it did crack after I dropped it on the carpet.  Be careful..."
-1,"I really thought this screen protector was going to protect my screen. It seemed pretty thick and durable until the phone slipped from my shirt pocket as I bent over to sit (I am 5 feet tall, thus bent over the phone only fell from about half that) leaving the phone ( brand new) with two corners of cracked glass. Needless to say,  I'm not pleased."
1,"NICE PACKAGE. THE INSTRUCTION BOOK HAD TOO SMALL PRINT AND NOT ENOUGH INFO ON PRODUCT, HOW TO USE, WHAT THE LIGHT IS ETC. GOT SOME INFO ON LIGHTS AND HOW TO CHARGE ON THE INERNET AT THE ANKER WEB SITE. I HAVE NOT USED IT OTHERWISE, BUT WILL IN THE FUTURE."
-1,Product was ok. Not really what my daughter wanted but it was suppose to arrive in 3days and she needed this before school started. well 3 days turned into 6.
-1,I've had a [[ASIN:B001G5A4JA Small Aquapac Case]]  for my phone for years but my iPhone6 is too big for it so I bought this one to replace it based on the reviews and the fact that it should handle deeper water.  Unfortunately the latches in the FRiEQ case are far less reliable than the Aquapac and the first time I used it I had to keep checking the ground every time I opened the bag because one of the latches would fall out.  If I hadn't been so careful about that the phone would have drowned for sure.<br /><br />Now I know why the Aquapac is more than twice the price but it's well worth it.
1,"Finally got to use this on our family beach vacation and it was PERFECT! It struck the interest of both my mom and my aunt (who live near beaches), it worked so well I'm going to buy them each one as a gift :-)"
1,GOOD STUFF
1,Works wonderfully and keeps my phone charged.
1,Works great shipped fast
-1,I give it a one star because the screen couldn't even survive shipping...it was broken already.  by the time I got it
1,Great case for the money! I would definitely buy this again!
1,"I've been through many headphones and these are by far the best I've ever used.  They fit great and comfortable too.  Used them on a 15 mile training run then, came home and mowed and did yard work for several hours and they were still going strong when I finished.  Great battery life!  I've purchased a few things from this company and the customer service is beyond first class.  If you have ANY kind of problem they will make it right, no hassles and very quickly."
1,Just as expected. My toddler uses my phone to play games and it is holding up nicely. The stand is a bit difficult to get out but I would recommend this product.
1,Love the case! Took a little while to get here - but it was a good price!
1,"It's a nice iPhone 6 Plus Case and appears to be a good quality product. I think I would use it on traveling time. has slots to put your id and credit cards. Nice that it has a hand strap so when taking pictures if you drop your phone, you have the hand strap attached to your wrist to save your phone from falling to the group. And the magnetic snap to open and close it quickly. I love  the look of it and the feel. It is easy to clean and appears to be durable for long lasting. I love this vintage look. It's made of PU leather which is also described as split leather. It is a material made with a split leather backing covered with a layer of polyurethane (hence the term &#34;PU leather&#34;) that is applied to the surface and then embossed.<br />I think this will be durable enough to last a long time, but I will have to determine that over time.<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review"
1,"These cables are much lower in cost than the apple brand,but they work wonderfully!Apple certified.Work great!!!!"
1,"Wish it were more muted in color, but overall I like it."
1,"It's great. Looks pretty good. Feels sturdy. Fits my arm well when adjusted. iPhone seems secure and I can access all buttons. I like that it's kind of locked in. I do mostly cardio activity (running, bike riding) and the armband doesn't move around or bother me.<br /><br />Good price for the product received. I'd recommend."
1,"This is a great case for the price. OR, it's a great case that is not insanely overpriced! The soft/hard two piece design is very good for avoiding damage.  I like the kickstand, wish it was about 1/2 inch longer, making the unit stand more vertical.  All of the small holes line up just right. Don't spend $40 for a hip dude case, unless you just really like paying too much."
1,as  advertised
-1,Pretty disappointed in this item.....
1,"Saved my phone, cracked the screen protector but glass was fine."
1,"The i-Blason Galaxy Note 5 Case, Clip Holster Combo with Kickstand comes in two main parts: 1) Note 5 case with folding kickstand, and 2) Slide-in holster with belt clip.<br /><br />I will concentrate my review mostly on the case, as I will not be using the holster. The reason I stopped using holsters long ago is that my job requires physical labor - and in my past experience the holstered phone will always get caught/hooked on something and my expensive cell phone smart or not - will come flying off in a slow motion death crash!  I will say that when I tested the holster, the cased Note 5 slid in and out quite easily.<br /><br />The black case and holster are thin rigid plastic with an attractive but subtle texture design. I was attracted to this case mainly because of the option to use a stand.  I had another smart phone that had this feature built-in, and it was nice to use this when the need came up. The case fits nice and snug, snapping nicely around the Note 5. Instead of cut-out holes, (as used for the lens and light) to accommodate your volume and power buttons and plug-ins, there are open-sided cut arounds that work just fine. I prefer a more grip-pie soft feel that harder plastic feel, but it's not a deal breaker or anything - just my .02 cents.<br /><br />I like/dislike the KICKSTAND - it pulls out into position nicely using the 2 recessed indentations and snaps into locked position without much hassle. However, when you want to fold it flat, remember to use &#34;finesse&#34; as my normal (argh) gorilla pull tactic felt like I'd snap the stand in two. When the stand is used in horizontal or landscape position, the stand is off center axis and any slight push may knock your phone over.  Using the stand in the vertical or portrait position, the Note 5 feels a little more balanced as the stand is centered. As to be expected it is top-heavy using the vertical stand-up mode. As long as you are careful touching the screen, and using your other hand to support your phone the tip-over problem should be kept at the minimum.<br /><br />Pros:<br />&#62;Quality build, looks good<br />&#62;Case slides and rests easily into holster<br />&#62;Stand is very useful<br /><br />Cons:<br />&#62;Stand is not center balanced in horizontal/landscape position, may easily fall over<br />&#62;Stand snap back into flat position needs gentle touch<br /><br />This review is my opinion - and your experience can be totally different - depending on your applications.

1,Had them installed for a few months now. rarely get flashed. much brighter and cleaner looking then my old halogen bulbs. and for the price you cant beat them there cheaper then silverstars and have much better visability!
1,Like the cover so people to my left can't see what I'm looking at!
0,"While I love the design, the plastic on the bottom where the speakers and plug-in fit were sharp and I could not hold the phone when texting. It was as though it needed to be sanded down during the finish product stages."
1,Great product
-1,It keeps falling out of my vent.  Not happy with it
0,"Been using OtterBox on my past few devices and notice quality may be falling. The soft case of the Commuter I purchased for my Note 4 seems a little misshaped and distorted, as if it was removed from its mold warm or too soon. The dust covers for the earphone and USB won't fit tight even if I attempt to &#34;massage&#34; them into place. - This may just be my last OtterBox purchase... Sorry guys."
1,Worked perfectly and auto detected all the steering wheel buttons. I would recommend flashing to the most recent firmware before installation.
1,Reasonable price and quick shipping speed.
-1,It may say that it is unblocked but it doesnt work for virfin mobile it doesnt have the right material and thus doesnt work
-1,This Bluetooth car speaker sucks! I had it turned all the way up and I still couldn't hear the caller. This was a really big disappointment. I know that the thing is capable of being louder because the voice that announces connection is loud and clear. It is impossible to hear the caller at any volume level. I definitely learned my lesson about buying no name brands.
1,This is very much worth the money. This case seems like it should be about $50. One heck of a deal. Mind only took about 3 and a half days to come and came with no problems. The design is good and feels great. The screen protector is not so good but are very cheap to buy the good kinds. I highly recommend this case to everyone.
1,Great guy. Great price. Thin case fits phone perfectly. Thank you!
1,Like
1,Great product. It's nice to be able to have one place to charge all of our devices without the need to use individual bricks for each device.
1,"Good headset for the money. Functional, communicative and works for me. Can't touch the Bose though."
1,Great price! Great case! Perfect fit. Rugged but not too big. Easy to hold and easy to use phone. Provides a solid grip. Beautiful color.
1,Fits my phone great and can hold some bills and my ID and credit card.  I just wish it had a wrist strap and it would be perfect!
1,excellent exactly what I wanted
1,Love it
1,Nice
1,"I researched for awhile before settling on a case. I previously bought a water proof case for an HTC one that was terrible. This case is great. Fits the note 4 perfect. It may not be completely water proof, but it definitely feels resistant. The S pen can still be accessed. Good product!"
1,This case is so cute and it works well. It does what it is supposed to do only problem is the fit is a little too big and there is no hole for a camera so to take a pic you have to take the phone out.
1,"I have already tried several types of screen protector and all of them are a failure. A friend have used this and I thought I should try it. Im glad I did! It offers dust free screen, no marks and bubble free!"
1,Great. ! Mickey very adorable cute.
1,Great built plug
1,Protects screen very well!
1,so far so good!
1,It made me very happy.
-1,It broke when I put it in and wouldn't let me put my phone case on
1,great case; well made; fits tight.  I think I may be one of the last people who do not own a smart phone but I am very happy with this model phone that I own as long as I can still find the accessories that I need.
1,love
1,It feels great in the hand. It protects the phone and screen well while being really slim.
1,Got three of these cases they are really great would buy again !
1,The unit does get very warm after a full charge.
1,Great product. This one fits a Sportage 2012 full edition remote control
-1,None of the Chargers worked.
1,My case arrived when they said it would and the quality is great. I love my new case.
1,good for adventures and being out for long periods of time.  Use it to charge my speaker when out by the pool or beach.
1,Very good case..fits lg g4bwith leather back.
-1,"Very cheaply made, the first time I removed it the plastic area near the volume buttons broke."
1,Keeps my watch safe from bumps generally happy!
-1,With in two weeks of it being installed by a professional repair shop screen has white spots and in it. Also appears that glue is peeling away from side of screen.
1,"This is an Awesome product!!! The compatibility with Echo is great, easy set up as well"
0,Performed as expected.
-1,"This is my second otterbox case that I've owned, I work in the railroad industry and need a tough case. Well unfortunately I dropped my phone and belt clip about 5 feet order the ground and the phone popped out of the clip and a corner of the chipped off and now the phone falls out of the clip constantly. No damage to my phone that I noticed but it did it's job."
1,Good cell phone
1,Love this case !
0,Works well with my phone
1,Perfect for my husbands phone!
1,Best sub
1,"Cover was easy to put on and it seems to fit tight  All holes line up accordingly so there are zero problems with my Note 4.  I will use this cover as my everyday cover now that I put it on, I also bought 2 other fancier covers but like this one so much I haven't even tried them yet."
1,Much more than expected.  Sound volume and quality is outstanding
1,Great product and great service!
0,The pockets for credit cards are a touch too narrow.  I had to force in the driver's license and one credit card; which are both standard size.  Doing so kinda felt like this was defeating the purpose for these pockets.
1,"Jenna here- I purchased this tempered glass screen protector after my previous one chipped after 6 months. I'd changed my phone from it's everyday protective case to a fashion (plastic, clear) case for a wedding party and, naturally, dropped it within minutes, chipping the corner. Quality tempered glass protectors will fracture in large breaks, containing the impact and damage- which is what you are looking for when shopping the many brands and makes online.<br /><br />This was my third brand I've tried- installation was standard but not the smoothest experience. I'd say this protector is about 2/3 thickness of my previous IntelliGlass protector. It also seemed to be a little off in the button port placement, as I feel the centered placement (on the button) is just off to the left, as minimal as it is to notice this threw me off and I had to re-seat it twice before final sealing.<br /><br />My protector was dirty/smudgy with a lot of marks when I peeled off the protective sheet and I had to use the included cloth to remove these marks before applying. I had no issues with bubbles or pockets and it sealed, fairly quick, on it's own with just a tab of pressure in the center.<br /><br />Since this tempered glass protector is a little thinner than previous one's I've owned it actually seems to work better with my SPECK case, and even better with my waterproof (Lifeproof) case, which is a benefit.<br /><br />This kit includes everything you need- alcohol wipe, dust sticker sheet, microfiber cleaning cloth and instructions- as well as 1 screen protector. Some other brands include 2 per package, which is nice- but I anticipate this will last just as long, if not longer than my previous one, so I don't mind.<br /><br />If you're new to tempered glass screen protectors, there is a touch feel and responsiveness that is unmatched in comparison to other screen protection methods- I just love it. Everyone who handles my phone asks why my picture looks so clear in low and high lighting, or why it just plain 'feels' so good to use. Most smartphones have gorilla glass equivalent screens- your phone is intended to be used with a glass responsive experience, if you don't have a glass protector you're missing out in my opinion!<br /><br />We were given a product discount in hopes we'd share our honest thoughts and experiences, which we have done.e.

1,I t works as ecpected.  It is larger than I thought.  It size is similar to my galaxy phone so it is awkward to carry around but will give a couple of charges to the phone.
0,NOT VERY BAD
1,"My new phone has a sealed battery.  Before, I would carry a few spare batteries with me throughout the day so I could keep using the phone all day long.  I decided to invest in a portable battery charger and since I've had good success with Anker products, I decided to give the Astro E1 a shot.<br /><br />The E1 charges faster than I expected, taking my phone from 30% to 90% in about 30 minutes.  Plus, it does have enough power to charge a couple of times before needing to be recharged.  On the downside, it is a little heavier and larger than anticipated.  Still, give me something a little bigger and heavier that works great than something that's too small and can't get the job done.<br /><br />This is a must purchase for any iPhone & Galaxy S6 user to prevent being chained to an outlet."
1,I have gotten more inquires and complements on this case than on all iyherd👍😬
1,"Looks great, feels great :) (hasn't fallen yet)"
1,"Awesome band, easy to install and I get alot of comments."
-1,Do not buy this item.  Thin layer and does not look like anything the ad represents.  Ripped off  And the seller owes me a new phone because the hammer test is clearly draud
-1,"Won't hear crap, changed every speaker in the truck to the best but this doesn't have no power, piece of crap"
1,Very high quality. The price is higher than the cheapest but the quality is unmistakeable. The cord is heavier and the connectors are more robust. I like the extra length.
1,Great protective case!<br />I've been using mine for 2 years now and had multiple oops I dropped my phone incidents and no damage!
1,Very good product. Does exactly what you said. It literally doubles the battery. This case is amazing.
1,Very nice phone case.
1,I love the animal print. I was a little unsure of the case but i love it. Very good quality and my phone is safe from harm!
1,My daughter loves it!  She has it on her iPod 5.  Had it on for a few weeks now no peeling looks good.
-1,"IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE LEATHER, LOOKS VERY CHEAP :("
-1,This cable is poor very poor quality cheap made
1,Excellent
1,Excelent
0,"The case is wonderful, I did not receive the stylus pen.It will be great if you can send it"
1,"I couldn't be more pleased.  I have been using ZAGG products for years, and although they protected very well (never had a screen break even after dozens of phone drops), they do eventually get really awful looking with little scratches, edge peels, etc; and I could never install one 100% air-bubble free.  This Tempered Glass screen protector for the Samsung Note 5 installed easily, and crystal clear.  Not a bubble in site.  The coverage doesn't go 100% to the edge, so I will have to take the phone out of the case monthly or so for a full cleaning; but I am very, very pleased with this protector.  The proof will of course be in how it handles in a drop."
-1,Wrong size. No good description on the website
-1,"I have a hard hearing with this.  I only use it in an office so it is not back round noise.  My hearing is very good, so it is the product."
1,Works great.  I have different types of devices plugged in and charges as expected.
1,The difference quality can make is huge!  These came as a recommendation from a friend who is a hard core audiophile.  Well worth the money and awesome sound.
1,"Works well, had no problems setting up."
-1,Out of the box the right speaker output was dead.
-1,failed to work with data transfer on my devices very quickly after initial use
1,Cable was a little short for what I was in need for
1,Best Shower speaker for a great price!
1,"This little speaker works so well! I don't like the weird voice that talks once you turn it on, but that's super minor. Great sound from such a little speaker!"
1,"Perfect,it's delivered as promised.<br />Thank you"
1,"Bought this as a gift for my daughter that is always losing her phone. Awesome deal. Bluetooth works great, easy to sync. Great for people that's are always working with their hands and she is always busy doing something. She loves it! Very inexpensive and now I'm the coolest mom ever."
1,I was surprised that the wallet was of good quality. It fit my daughter's Galaxy Express perfect.
1,Love it
1,"Was initially taken back by the design.  It was a bit bigger than I anticipated.  After putting it together and using for the first time, I fell in love with it.  Securely holds the watch and iPhone in place."
1,"I brought this for my girlfriends Iphone 5s. She has a tendency of dropping her phones...on the ground, in cups of tea, pretty much any where and every where. In flip phones never lasted with her. so I needed a good case that would survive what would the equivalent of a world war that was cramped in the span of 1 year.  I picked the case up for several reasons:  1) the hard case, I need this SOB to last. 2) The soft grip, you know just incase you leave the phone on top of a subaru going 60 miles an hour, I'd love it if the phone would just say on top and last..(spoiler alert it did...) 3) it looked alright."
-1,It was for a ATT model. Made it work. Have prpduct with proper carrier listed.
1,Great conversation piece. It's not quite protective but it's pretty and crystals all around and the wine flows all over. It cracks me up personally. Looks just as pictured. I received this at a discount for my honest review.
1,"Works well, does QC 1.0/2.0 as advertised."
1,As described. Fast shipping.
1,Fast shipping just as described
1,"Like it, love it!"
-1,"Although it is cute it doesn't glow at all which sucks , and from reading the other comments other people have the same issue. I'm very disappointed and if it wasn't such a pain in the ass i would send it back."
1,hold phone nice and tight the rubber band stop phone from moving easy to attach to bike daughter love it
1,"Went on easy and works great! I have my phone in a wallet case and the credit cards sometimes indent the shield with letters, but it always heals itself. Also the day after I put it on, I noticed a bubble but remember reading that bubbles will disappear...and sure enough it did in a day or 2!"
1,Works well so far.  Will update if anything goes wrong with it.
1,"Needs to improve touch sensitivity, when i press for voice notes rec. only about 8-9 sec. Even pressing really hard."
1,"3 ft is perfect length for front seat access, but not for back seat works great and sound is clear, and is also easy to store since it will not get tangled easily"
1,Very nice built quality. Have it by my bedside now.
-1,Couldn't here it phone was loader!  Through in garbage.
1,Great when using GPS works great you can read you screen with no problem and 100% waterproof my phone had never gotten wet
1,The case is light and sturdy.  It is easy to wear on my belt and thus far I have had no problems.
1,They are great at work.
0,"Showed up in a bag, not real packaging.  The case it's self is really nice, but the glass screen cover came broken across the top, probably because it was in a Baggie not a box."
-1,"This DOES NOT stick at the edges. I was extremely careful while putting it on, followed the instructions carefully, and I have successfully put on 5+ glass screen protectors on other phones. It DOES NOT stick at the edges. There is a noticeable halo effect around the edge of the phone, even though this protector doesn't extend past the flat areas of the screen.<br /><br />Also it developed a hairline crack through the middle in the first week or so, without me having dropped the phone. Probably because it doesn't stick at the edges..."
1,Great Product really reliable and good quality for the price. Might even buy one for my wife. Thank you.
-1,"Purchased 2 of these cause they stated they were Adaptive Fast charging for my Note 4. Plugged them in, no notification that the &#34;fast charger connected&#34; came up... after about 30 min only charged 6%. An &#34;adaptive fast charger&#34; would of charged at the least 30-50% in a 30 minute span. My original has the adaptive fast charging logo on it. This one did not. Returning for refund."
0,"Protects the screen, scratches minimal so far, but shows fingerprints and smudges terribly."
1,Best phone holder
1,I love this case!!!! Well worth the money and I received it much earlier than I expected...
1,"Feels incredibly durable, I got this to keep my phone protected and well I am very certain that no harm will ever happen with it in this case. The only problem I have is the latch that covers the headphone port it's a little inconvenient when you have headphones in while it's in your pocket. But honestly you can take it off so I don't really care. Great case very satisfied."
1,Love this. Charges everything for my tablet to my wireless mouse.  Have it set up at the computer and it works as advertised. I would recommend  this for anyone needing a USB port for charging.
1,"Less than the best jawbone. Noise cancellation is not as good as previous and battery talk time is short. The charging case makes it last the day though, it's super small and light weight, and the ear gel is comfortable. I always make custom gels for my Bluetooth headset, but these fit so well I didn't need to."
1,"Hello everyone! I have the good fortune as to be able to review the Symaxio Wireless bluetooth earphone! I received it free of charge from the company itself, and I was able to test it out and compare it to my other Bluetooth earpiece. The sound quality is great, it’s easy to use, and it holds a charge a lot longer than my old earpiece! Its sleek design and easy to wear earpiece makes the product very comfortable. I enjoyed this product and I hope that you will too, if you are in the market for a Bluetooth earpiece."
-1,"NO IT DOESNT FIT ALL GALAZY 3, MINE IS S3-S968C AND THE CASE IS WAY TOO SMALL"
1,Works great!
-1,Cheepest piece of crap ever total waist of money  !
0,These stylus worked good up till about a week ago now not working as good as before.
1,My daughter loves it!!
1,good
1,Great item. This is my second one
1,Works well. Wish the bevel was a little larger.
1,"Product seems to be working very well with both iPhones and our iPad.  Would definitely recommend.  Nice having the dual ports, which both work well at the same time, not slowing down charging."
1,"Device worked great for me. Right out of the box, charged my phones multiple times as a test, performed like a champ. One of the best deals out there for $/capacity/quality"
1,"Remember those times when you're in the car... and your phone gives off the dreaded &#34;low battery&#34; sound? Remember that no more! The Anker PowerDrive 2 will charge your phone and tablet quickly and with the proper amount of power so you can be back to using them in a short time!<br /><br />The PowerDrive 2 has a exterior gloss finish around the sides, but on the front where you can plug in two charging cables, there is a matte finish. I do find that there is a problem with this, because as soon as I pulled the charger out of the socket, I noticed there were visible scratches on the glossy finish. Granted, there are somewhat sharp components in a car charger, but having a glossy finish which can get scratched easily is, in my opinion, not good design. A matte finish would be better design.<br /><br />Unboxing the charger was no pain at all, I love Anker's frustration free packaging. Plugging it in was not pain at all as well. However, when I went to pull out one of my charging cables, it pulled the whole PowerDrive out of the charging socket. It might just be that the USB connections are tight, or that it is a new product, but it still seems like a little flaw to me.<br /><br />The PowerDrive 2 also comes with an included Apple Lightning Cable, but since I'm an Android user I can't testify how good the cable is. But, judging by how pleased I am with my Anker Android cables, I will say that the Lightning Cable is probably a great cable!<br /><br />Anyone who travels in a car, or owns one needs to get this product! The charging speed you get on this charger is much faster than other chargers. The PowerDrive 2 is easy to use, it can charge two devices at once to ensure you and any passengers stay charged up.<br /><br />I've used other car chargers and this blows them away. Anything with PowerIQ will blow anything else away. Other charge slowly and sometimes not at all. With some other terrible chargers, I might get 1% for every 3-5 minutes. With the Anker PowerDrive 2, I get 1% for every 1-2 minutes, which is much better compared to other chargers.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really impressed with this car charger. If you don't have an Anker car charger, this one will work much better than your current one! You won't regret your purchase when you see how fast it charges. I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />Video Unboxing: https://youtu.be/unvlLyiIQkEive 2, I get 1% for every 1-2 minutes, which is much better compared to other chargers.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really impressed with this car charger.

-1,This product does not work. I bought two and both of them broke within a few uses. It does not mount on to the vent well. The phone falls from it all the time.
1,Great case! Fits nicely on my Space gray iPhone 6 (4.7) and the cut outs for all the plugs and cables fit well. My only complaint is that casemate cases aren't necessarily worth 18-25 dollars but it seems to be pretty durable quality. My cat likes it too.
1,good product
1,"works great, excellent price"
-1,Too small for BLU LIFE VIEW 5.2 screen
1,"The case meets the expectations , thin, elegant , and the price falls within the range of the competition. I am satisfied with my purchase. Thanks!!!"
1,My 10-year old daughter loves this case on her phone.  Very strong and sturdy as she has had a few slips and drops but no effects to the phone.  Grips great looks great also.
-1,Definitely NOT leather!!!
1,great deal.
1,"Love it, works very good and charges fast"
1,I love it
1,Good quality.. And provided good protection..
1,I love it it glows in the dark lol
1,"I carry this stand with me all over the house to watch videos while I fold laundry, cook, apply makeup, etc.  my iphone 6 plus sits perfectly and it's very light and durable.  I absolutely love it!"
1,Great band but slow delivery!
1,Excellent
1,"functional, they did the job"
1,Works great
1,Came as promised.  This replaces one that I've had for a couple years.  Really like the UP app with its Smart Coach!
1,"This mount is simple, portable and sturdy and well built. Its highly adjustable and I consider it to be a very good product for the money! It clips on and is very tight so it does not fall off. I use it for my iPhone 6 and move it between 2 vehicles and a boat."
1,LOVE my case! It's beautiful and fits perfectly.
0,I thought it was a great case but my son (who I got it for) says it's annoying and he won't use it anymore.  He had an issue with the kickstand but I am not sure if it was just teenage boy or if it was something legitimate.
1,"Excellent protection for my Samsung Galaxy phone.  The case is made of durable plastic.  I can't tell you how many times I've dropped my phone and the case has saved my phone from damage numerous times.  The only thing is, once it's on, it's a little difficult to take off.  You have to remove the white case first before you can remove the black case as it is in 2 pieces.  I guess this is a good thing but a bit of a pain if you have to remove it as I have, in order to remove the battery to reset my phone."
1,I just used the glass had a professional installation of the glass. Still have the rest of the set.
1,Great headphones. a little uncomfortable if worn for a long time.
1,"Absolutely, lifesaver on tons of drops that happened on concrete, water puddle, accidentally jumped into a pool, took a picture under water..  Etc."
-1,"Does not stick does not work no adhesive dried up , so pissed!"
1,Works perfectly and was a great price
-1,Flimsy product
1,get it
-1,"I purchased three different styles of the elago brand cases for my iPhone 6 at one time. Loved the color and slim fit, however it offered very little protection especially along the top and bottom of the case. Hard plastic and very smooth leaving no grip at all. Definitely would not trust it being protected if it was to be accidentally dropped."
1,"I am happy with it. You get what you pay for. It does the job, is small enough for travel. I had to Send my original back after almost one year, it just stopped charging. Verizon honored the warranty without any hassle and got a brand new one. I also own a Galaxy Note, works just as good for MY needs. I use both of them."
1,"I love it, however, I wished it had a volume function on the unit."
1,Works and fit Sylvania DVD PLAYER
1,"I love these belt pouches. I had one for my iPhone 4s, and couldn't live without it when I got my iPhone 6. I found that this 6-Plus pouch works perfectly for the iPhone 6 inside an Otterbox Defender. (The one for the i-phone 6 was too tight, contrary to reviews and answered questions there.) I like the way you can slip a belt through the loops, and also hook it on the waistband of your pants. I bought several of them, to facilitate switching between pants from day to day. By the way, I would think that the iPhone 6-Plus inside an Otterbox Defender would NOT fit in this pouch."
1,"Screen protector at it's best! This screen has a silky smooth feeling, easy to install and clear clarity. I don't notice a difference with the screen on, it feels and looks the same.<br />#1 Before applying the screen, clean all dust and debris from your phone. Use the alcohol pad and dust absorber. I took my phone in the bathroom then turned on the shower to settle the dust. The process took about 2 minutes  to complete.<br /><br />Good investment for your cell phone. This can save you the cost of repairing a cracked or severely scratched screen. I recieved a discount for my honest Opinion."
-1,Bottom line this product did not work.  It would not charge my phone through case.  I also put a fully charged phone in the case and charged the both.  when i woke up the next morning the case had take the charge from the phone.
1,Fits the phone well and is very sturdy. Does not add much extra bulk to the phone either. Very happy with this product
-1,"These speakers blew within 2 - 3 weeks after installation.  They sounded good before that, now they sound worse than my stock speakers."
1,"These are great cases. I've heard that the anodized aluminum case of the sport version of the apple watch scratches very easily, so I just wanted something to protect from scratches. These are not meant for heavy duty impact protection; if that is what you're looking for I would recommend one of the full body all in one type of band/cases.<br /><br />These also improve the look of the watch, making it a little dressier and less feeling like you're wearing your fitness tracker to the office. Pair this case with a jazzy new watch band and no one will know you went the cheap route (as far as purchasing any apple product could be called cheap)! The only caveat with these cases is that they do slide on and off easily, so they could potentially catch on clothing and be pulled off of the watch. This has only happened to me once or twice while changing and is not a big deal to me."
1,Excellent fit to the phone.
1,Great screen protector
0,The Aukey Arrived in a box nicely packaged with the item along with a short charging cable. the aukey would charge my phone on roadtrips so when i get to my destination i would have full charge for all day use and still have enough power to charge up my phone again for more hours or for the roadtrip back home. lasted me a good month until the product no longer wants to charge my phone without cutting off but will stay on to charge itself.
0,"So I have been buying Auvio headsets for years. The only time I have to replace them is when I loe them because they never break down. Auvio is a  quality brand with quality products. My only complaint is not with the product but rather with the seller and its packaging. Typically, when I purchase an Auvio product, I receive three sizes of earbuds. I use the smallest ones because my ears are small. But the one thing that could ruin such a great product happened which was that I didn't get the sizes of ear buds. So as I am writing this review, I have to periodically push in the ear phones as they slowly slide out of my ear. This is especially frustrating as I begin my first semester of college. First world problems are hardly problems but seriously D:"
1,"Love it. Great clear image. And the case is sturdy as while. Only one problem, the button above the power button is so hard that I can't push it and have to shut my phone off another way. Besides that, this is a wonderful item."
-1,"First things first, let's point out what's good about it; it keeps it pretty much dry, and dust is prevented too. It snaps on pretty tightly.<br /><br />What's bad; you lose your silence button on the side of the phone. You cannot switch it, no matter how hard you try. The screen is cheap, and you can see grid dots in it. Mine came with scratches in the screen too. Every scratch you make on the back of it shows badly. (Black case) just from every day handling. If you want to use headphones, you have to screw in the adapter on account that the jack is too deep now from the case's depth. It is a cheap alternative to the &#34;life proof&#34; case, but it comes with sacrifices I do not want to make. The screen also has a glare to it. It takes away from the brilliant brightness that the iPhone is known for. I'm returning mine."
1,It's great!
-1,Had issues with charging and after 3 months the adapter to charge no longer works.
1,This is a great product.  I have used it for both my Note and my iPhone 6+.  It charges fast.  This is holding up better than the one I bought from Brookstone.  I've only used the wall unit.  I haven't used the car charger.  We've had this for about 8 months.
1,"So much better than the old versions of playing iPhone over the radio. Clear sound as if it was hooked up to the iPhone. Occasionally, it drops the connection especially when I use Siri. I just re-pair the device and all is good."
1,Case feels solid and fits the phone perfectly. Have not dropped the phone so I can not attest to the protection. The clear back is nice if you want to put a sticker between the case and phone
0,It was ok
1,"Pretty good case but I feel that when I put my screen face down it will still get scratched, there's not a lot of room between the screen and the table. But gorgeous case. Design hasn't scratched off(yet)"
0,"This case did not protect the phone enough for me. I'm use to the bumpers covering the phone a little more. However the case arrived quickly, and was a gorgeous color and really showed the beauty of the phone. It just wasn't as much protection as I would have preferred."
1,holds up well not very protective but i get a lot of compliments on it
1,"works well. comfy, fits the case too! iphone 6"
1,"I just came back on a long 6hr oceanic flight and the battery lasted the whole flight.  It's true that these, as labeled, are actually less mAh than the original battery.  I was initially concerned because I charged both the new battery and an OEM battery in another nook, then ran a looping video player on both, and after a few hours the new battery seemed to be a few percentage less than the original OEM.  I was thinking of returning it if it couldn't even keep up with a 5yr old nook.  However, after about 3 hours the original OEM took a quick nosedive whereas this one kept going with the same level discharge curve.  This is exactly what we found on the flight as well.  The only problem now is that I have to upgrade my wife's nook as well!<br /><br />I googled for a Youtube installation video and that was very accurate.  No problems following the instructions.  The OEM battery has a small buffer around the battery to fit the opening a little better but I haven't noticed any problem with this battery in the slightly larger opening.  The only trick I found with reinstalling it is that the triangular cover with the rubber straps sometimes won't fit; it's easier if you pull the cover out completely and then after it's closed use a small screwdriver to push the rubber straps back in - they fit one way and won't pull out.<br /><br />I think any 5yr old nook can probably benefit from this battery, but before you do that you might also take a quick look at your battery cable and connector.  On one of my nooks the battery wasn't charging so I bought this replacement.  It turns out that afterwards it still wasn't.  Upon closer inspection both the cable & port on the nook were damaged.  That's why the cable felt a little weird plugging it in.  In the end, I had to give up on that nook because there's no way to repair that port.  Fortunately I had another nook to put the new battery into."
1,Poduct seems to be of good quality but doesn't lay down all the way on my phone and leaves an air pocket on the uper right hand corner.<br />the screen is super clear other than that.
1,Excellent product
1,"Larger than I thought, but to be able to power items up to a laptop is a fantastic deal here."
1,good
-1,They really mean that this product is a cracked LCD screen. Somehow I thought this product was to replace a cracked screen.
0,Ok
-1,"I bought this for a trip and it broke instantly, I cannot even charge it anymore. This is not a good quality purchase, I would NOT recommend unless you are looking to throw $15 down the drain."
-1,"I have a lifeproof case for our iPad and I was excited to get one for my new phone. I water tested the unit as the instructions stated and it passed perfectly. I installed the case on my phone. I was disappointed when the Touch ID did not work, but I felt that was not a deal breaker. So I made my first call to see how the speaker and microphone worked. The speaker sounded slightly muffled, but not too bad. The microphone however was horrible. The called said I sounded like I was in a cave, very muffled, garbled and barely understandable. I was crushed. Guess I need to look for a new case..."
1,"Great fitting case, and clear enough to show the Lumia casing's brilliant color!"
1,Protects the phone as much as a bumper case can;  feels & looks great!
1,As described and shipped fast.  Very satisfied.
0,thank you
1,Very Good Look and affordable
-1,Was really excited when i first ordered them. I tried them out yesterday for literally 3 minutes they worked fine and sounded great.. Tried to use them today and nothing worked. I charged them for an hr and a half and still wouldnt turn on and no lights or anything come on. Now they are so hot it literally burns my fingers to even pick them up. What is going on!?
1,My ear lobes are very small and sensitive.  I found these headphones to be very comfortable and lightweight.  The volume control buttons are easily accessible and I like that they are raised which makes it simple to adjust.  You'll hear a message stating that youve  reached the maximum volume.  Thia gives you a powerful punch of sound.  Making calls and receiving calls is very simple and the sound quality is amazing.  I like the behind the head strap as it can easily be hidden under my hair.  Getting a full charge took less than 30 minutes.  The earhooks can easily be taken off and put back on as needed.  The little pouch that is included is an added bonus for storing tour headphones.  Received free for my honest review.
1,"fonctionne bien , rien a dire appart Top Notch!!!*****"
1,Love it. Amazing product.
1,"I use it with my Microsoft surface 3 to watch movies on long plane trips. I start with the unit plugged into the surface, runs movies with volume up for over 18 hours. YES OVER 18 HOURS. What can I say other than I love it. I don't write reviews, but just had to share my joy with this product."
1,"This is probably the 4th case for my S5 and by far my favorite. It doesn't even look like a case! The black is matte, and the gold trim is classy. I've had it for 3 months now and still looks brand new. No scratches on the black, no chipping on the gold. The openings are a perfect fit and can charge the phone with the case on. I haven't dropped it yet, so I can't speak to how well it protects the phone, but it's a pretty hard plastic so I can't imagine it's going to hold up if you're someone who drops your phone a lot. The text on the back looks identical to the Samsung OEM font so it looks pretty legit. I would 100% recommend."
1,Perfect! Also very sturdy.
-1,"Pros: Great that its water resistant, back up battery , answer phone calls with it.  Good back up speaker.  Cons: sound quality"
1,Just what I needed....
1,"Excellent armband for a runner. Minimum bulk, lightweight, the phone slips in and out easily, easy to strap on and take off, safe and solid hold on the phone, the materials are durable, and the price is right. And no, I don't work for TuneBand. I got my first TuneBand for my iPhone 4 when that phone just came out and just got a new band for my iPhone 6. After all that time the old band was still like new. TuneBand comes with two different size armbands and if one of them doesn't fit they'll send you a smaller or larger or middle sized one that does (just reply to the email they send you that explains this free service)."
1,Absolutely love the quick charge of this charger. Charges my moto x in about 40 minutes. I couldn't live without it now.
1,It's hard to find a Bluetooth headset that sounds good when having a phone conversation. I've tried several different headsets and this one is the best. My friends are no longer upset when I use Bluetooth because the quality is so good.<br />I wish music could sound a little beter but the phone callsare more important and th quality is great there.
1,Does the job very well...
-1,just plastic .....dont buy it
1,Works great
1,great
1,Very nice i iwll buy it again.
1,Very nice i iwll buy it again.
1,it's sweet!  so much juice. it's large size
1,"Excellent quality and design rolled into a secure case that looks good too!  I really enjoyed the ease in which the case could be assembled/disassembled, but still felt very secure in how it fit together.  I feels like complete protection from the built in screen protector to the built in port covers, this case provide a very good amount of protection for the average iPhone 5 user.    After just a couple of days of my using it, my 17 year old daughter pursuing me so much for the cover that I finally gave it up to her to test.  She loved it the customization covers and, surprisingly, her biggest excitement was that the Apple logo shown through the rear of the case!  She said it added a little bit to the size of the phone, but after an hour or so she couldn't imagine her phone without the case - and this coming from a 17 year old girl!   Great design, excellent quality and customization.  What else do you need?!?!"
1,Compact and solid. Easy to handle.
1,"As an electrical engineer, I am always looking for cool new gadgets to make my life easier.<br /><br />The first thing i noticed about this charger is it is a bit bulkier and heaver than expected. A bit cumbersome for a pocket but doable in an emergency. I think this is better for bags or something like a camping trip rather than carrying it at all times.<br /><br />As far as charging mine worked great with borderline non stop use for about a year and a half. The 2 amp charging port (unlabeled which was annoying) charged my phone fairly fast and allowed me to use my phone for literally days longer than normal. If you are not in a hurry or need to charge multiple devices, the other socket also worked well but over time would not charge my phone while I was on it but rather slow it's decharge.<br /><br />As far as capacity is concerned this battery pack was good for about 4 to 5 charges. It also has the standard built in flash light which is more of a novelty than anything but can be useful if you do not have your smart phone.<br /><br />Besides it's size, the only down side is it's recharge time which take about 24 hours to fully charge it back up.<br /><br />Compared to other devices this one is fantastic and I would recommend spending the extra money but towards the end of it's life this will stop working well."
1,I love this cord. It lights up and is a better quality than the one that come with my phone.
1,really good
1,Works well and reliably. A basic dual USB wall charger.
1,This product worked great.  I used it with both a Samsung Galaxy S2 and S4.  Everything including the NFC worked as it should.  I really had fun with it and look forward to new apps being released that I can use it on.
-1,The &#34;rubberized coating&#34; peeled off within a week and I was left with a white case were the two interlocking pieces began unlocking and falling apart within 2 weeks. Not even worth the 2 dollars I spent.
0,"brown colored s*** but durable and true leather, you can wipe your ass with it."
1,Good quality and holds a long charge.  Used it on a trip recently and was so glad to have it.
1,"I use up battery on my phone like no other. I love having a couple of backups. Batteries work fine and charger works great too. No issues. I have charged the Anker batteries in my Samsung charger, and charged the samsung battery in the Anker charger. It is awesome to have a spare battery and backup charger all the time. Super pleased with this product."
1,"The silicone pink cover is a little loose, but this is a really good tablet cover for the price."
1,"Great for long car rides, hold iPad 3 perfectly."
1,"Very nice product. The leather is soft and the color is very pretty.  It was so easy to take the original band off and slip this in.  It's really in there, and I'm not worried at all that it will break."
1,Works GREAT with my Asus Nexus tablet.  I plug it in and I'm watching videos or whatever I want.
-1,Fit in iPod touch and iPad 2 but fail to charge either. Tried with 4 cables that all worked without adapter.
1,"VERSATILE AND VERY GOOD PRODUCT,  GOOD AND  CHARGE FAST MY ANDROID"
1,I was pleasantly surprised with this band! I expected it to be cheap because the price was really wonderful compared to some others. But it does not feel cheap at all! It also is a very nice size for my tiny wrist.  I was always disappointed with my original Apple Sport band because it was so bulky and heavy. This is an AMAZING upgrade. I plan to buy a few others in different colors.
1,Right after I was accepted for the review I got my calling card credited to my account and the card works great. Would recommend to anyone
0,"i pulled it out of my ear and it snapped at the earbud, but it was okay while it lasted."
1,"The new watch band fit my 42mm stainless steel Apple watch perfectly, pretty much like it came from Apple itself.  I had to remove four links from band, which I did with the tool provided.  There were no instructions included so I used a video from the web, which was probably more useful than printed instructions anyway.  I was very pleased with the entire transaction and the watch band looks like it came with the watch.  It's also easy to change back to the sport band that did come with the watch.  Impressive quality at a good price."
-1,"Product came when it was supposed to, which to me is very important.  It seems to be working well.  I've had it 4 months and it stopped working for some reason.  The return policy ran out.  Buying something else.  Enough of Anker!"
1,Great quality at a very good price.  Arrived quickly.
1,"Super fast shipping and it fits my phone perfectly. It was kind of tricky putting it on (it has the rubber case part and the single hard cover piece fits over the back of it and covers the side pieces a little) but after i managed to get it placed properly, it fit great."
1,Very nice case. I will order the black one also. And maybe the red one. Easy on and off.
1,works great
1,Received sooner than expected and the product was good quality. Highly recommend
1,"I have been searching for a good quality case for my s6 that looks nice and protects my phone at the same time. I have tried quite a few but this one is definitely my favorite. The high-quality leather case makes it easy to hold on to and looks great when Im using it. I love that I am still able to plug in my charger while I have my case on, unlike other cases that I have tried. This case fits great on my phone and it does not slide off. My favorite thing about this case is how slim it is. Other cases that I have tried are super bulky, but this is not and it still allows me to carry my phone in my back pocket. The gold accents give it a real classy look that I love. I will definitely be using this case for a while. I was graciously provided a discount on this case in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are my own."
1,Hands free....love it
1,"Works great so far, It's much higher quality than I was expecting for the money and having the second battery and external charger  is great for travel, it gives me two days of use without  needing to locate a charger."
1,Great band. Only thing is you need to make sure it is securely snapped.
1,"vey cute, stretchy and nice color. fits well for a teenager."
-1,"It stopped accepting a charge after 2 months. When I plug it in to replenish its stored energy, the lights no longer come on and blink as they did when I first got it."
1,"I am really impressed with this phone case and holster.  I previously had one of the plastic shell cases and belt clip and that thing broke within 1 month having never been dropped once.  I work in IT and I'm always bumping into stuff while holding equipment with both hands, so the case needs to hold up while on the belt clip as well as the occasional drop from your hands.  This case has strong protection of the phone and it doesn't &#34;bulk up&#34; the phone at all.  I mean seriously, the iPhone6 is wafer thin anyway, so a little extra protection doesn't hurt.  The only drawback is the belt clip will swivel a little easily if you bump into things, but I consider that minor vs. the protection and ease of use.  I'm really enjoying it and I expect to have it for a long time to come.  Nice job BUDDIBOX."
1,Fits my needs.
1,"Works well and charges fast. Product exactly as described, low price, fast shipping. Buy with confidence from this vendor"
-1,Doesn't work well
-1,Garbage.
1,c
1,"This charger does what it is supposed to do - charges my devices and charges them quickly. My favorite part? My cat doesn't like black cables, so I don't have to worry about having them chewed up on me like I did with the white ones. I would definitely recommend these to anyone else who owns an a-hole of a cat who prefers chewing on white cables like mine."
1,"Well fitting secure cover.  Fits nice and tight on turbo fiber finish phone. Good solid color and feel, highly recommend after reading about various brands.  The shipping was really quick, glad I ordered this, well worth it."
1,Simple solution and worked very well.
1,"Love it, great item"
-1,"I bought this phone in November of 2014, hoping that this would be the answer to my wishes (being able to keep all of my apps as further updates would surely follow the purchase).  Unfortunately, my wishes were smashed to bits. Let me preface by saying that I don't know how to nor do I ROOT phones. I have purchased several so-called 8GB internal memory phones only to find out that there isn't enough room to update the apps.<br /><br />And YES, I did experiment with moving (a percentage of ) apps to my added on mini SD card. Like every other phone, you can't really add the &#34;app&#34; to the SD card, but rather what you use for that app (photos, music, book prefs). I did all I could to avoid updating bloat apps (HTC, GOOGLE, etc.) to no avail. Before the last update that I put off for over a week, I went from 0.63 GB of free space to 0.37 GB of free space. That means that I can't update any blessed apps that I want to, like AMAZON, KINDLE, AVAST, SKYPE without either moving something to the card or removing app(s).<br /><br />It would appear that I'm not shooting high enough. Perhaps I need more memory, like what galaxy phones allegedly have. Problem is, I don't want a contract and can't afford the S6. That leaves older phones with older batteries because they are no longer made. Most of which won't allow you to remove the battery to replace that.<br /><br />I just can't win."
-1,"I have had this phone for close to 2 months.  Up until a couple of days ago I would have rated the phone a 5, but the ringtone speaker stopped working.  I contacted Asus via eMail to find out how I get the phone fixed.  The customer service representative's response was illiterate and totally  useless information.  Now I'm faced with a dysfunctional phone as well as a seemingly dysfunctional customer service department.  I will update this review once I have resolved the problem to my satisfaction."
1,excelent
1,Love the card hoder and stand.variety of colors. Fits great on back of phone
1,"*Updated Review* We had an FM transmitter I loved, but had to use an adapter and I was tired of it. We purchased this because of all the great reviews and I am shocked. There is constant static and sound when using this. I have literally tried every station from 88-107 and never found a clear station. I'm back to using my old one with an adapter. I know it can't be where I live, as my other one is crystal clear. I'm not sure why this one didn't work for us. ________ I was contacted by the manufacturer based on my review above. They asked if I would be willing to try a different product to see if it made a difference. I was impressed by their customer service--they came to me, I didn't even complain to them directly. I received the new unit yesterday and it is a completely different experience--nice, clear transmission. Also, I am impressed with a company that cared so much about my individual experience that they did so much at their expense to give me a better experience. Well done!"
1,"For the price it was the exact quality I'd expect. Looks good, fits great. Excited to how long it will last!"
-1,When I went to take it off the phone it broke.
0,Rubber stretched and lost shape to phone.
0,"I ordered both a black and a blue band. The black one fit well and is holding up after the one day of use it's gotten so far. The blue one did not latch in securely, and the strap would just slide through. I am exchanging the blue band and will see later if the replacement band also has a problem or not.  As expected, they are a bit thinner than the Apple sport band. The fit is comparable, and the closure feels secure. The black one I am wearing now also attracts lint, which my white Apple sport band did not do. That's all I've really noticed at this point. Not as nice as the Apple band, but given the price tag, it's about what I expected and I'm satisfied (pending a replacement for the blue band that attached securely).  update: The replacement blue band arrived and is usable. It takes quite a bit of jiggling before it will catch securely, but it does eventually catch and is then functional."
1,Battery was weak giving a spotty signal to my Vivosmart but once the battery was replaced it is spot-on now.
1,does a great job of keeping my phone mounted to the air vent. it has only once fell off after a large speed bump.
1,Good to have a longer one.  Works every time
-1,worked good for a week and then intermittent for a day and then no output.  I opened the sealed charger section and could see where the capacitors spewed oil on the inner case.  Ended up just cutting the end off and attaching it to a 12 volt car adapter.  It charges that way so it must not have been any fault of the Xoom tablet.  Get yours from motorola and save yourself the aggravation.
1,"Perfect, covered nicely my phone with glass protector on the top."
1,"Fast Charger! Works well with my Samsung Galaxy S5 and S6 cell phones, as well as my Samsung Galaxy tablet!"
1,It's as expected.
-1,"Maybe I got a bad battery, but I don't think this one works even as well as the 9 month old original one it replaces. I've stopped using it and will be returning it."
1,This amp right here is a good amp i love this one it play real good on some 12s and on some 15s if you are look for a good amp this here will be the best one..
1,The only problem I had with it was the bottom and top edge pieces staying stuck down. Other than that it's beautiful and shiny(:
1,great
1,excellent
-1,Get what you pay for. Program won't work for Note 4 when it says it will
1,if you have a garmin for your motorcycle this is the cable you need to hard wire it to the bike.
1,Excellent  very  satisfied
1,Doesn't work well with my IPAD?
1,"Great screen protector.  Using this Tempered Glass Screen Protector is way better than the plastic ones I've been using.  No finger print smudge or scratches so far.  If you do get finger print smudge on the screen, you can just  use your sleeve or a cloth and it is easily removed.  All in all, I would recommend any Galaxy S6 user to get this screen protector."
-1,Terrible
-1,"Do not buy this product, it is junk. Broke the very first time."
1,Looks good and fits perfect. Just what I was looking for.
1,"Love it! Cheap yet durable, long battery life and sounds great..good product all round."
1,Spend the money and get both the Portable charger and RAVPower Solar Charger well worth the money.<br />I used the portable charger the entire weekend.  I charged it up on Friday morning and charged 3  I-pads and 3  I-phones each getting 3+ charges over the three days.  Still has one power bar here on Sunday night.
1,The look is quite impeccable however my only concern is that the back scratches quite easily. There are noticeable lines on the back that feel kinda annoying to the touch. The front is good and prevents the screen from making direct contact with the ground in case you drop it.
1,solid awesome product!
1,Great cases
0,"it ok, i was expecting more"
1,"I've only used Tempered glass screen protectors for my iPhone 6.  This is as good as the best of them. Tempered glass protectors in general have a great feel to them, and they look great.  They crack and shatter pretty easily, but I think of it as &#34;better the protector the the actual iPhone display.&#34;<br /><br />Also, no stupid bubbles on the display."
1,Really like this product
1,I had such high hopes for this cell phone case!  I was so excited to get it in the mail but was a tad bit disappointed when I took it out of the package.  The white back part is just a sticker of some sort and looks kind of cheap.  If it gets wet at any point in time I am sure that it is going to fall off and get gross...  There is a film on the  white that you need to peel off to make the white look shiny.<br />It is a nice case and I will keep it on my phone because there isn't many colorful cute cases out there right now for the edge.<br />I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.
1,"Nice cellphone. The display is easy for your eyes, since it has an automatic brightness control. The camera feature in great. work excellent for Movistar. Very satisfied."
1,Love my  case !!! The color was exactly what was shown and the quality is awesome! !!!
1,Love it
1,Really nice case! I would have rated 5 stars if it could hold more cards.
1,Everything great thanks much
-1,It doesn't charge as the original is a cheap one
1,Excellent product.
1,"Though delivery took a while, the case fits the phone very well, providing good protection without the bulk of some cases."
1,great
1,"Very sexy looking, well fitting, and good looking case. Only thing it could possibly do better is be waterproof.<br />Survived a few falls already."
-1,"These headphones can be fine as an entry into the foray of wireless headphones, though if you are looking for a value purchase that will last for a while this may not be the option you should choose, especially because this is purchased via an independent seller in Japan who will make it difficult for you to replace your likely broken headphones, as they have made it difficult for me.<br /><br />It's very easy to enjoy these headphones when you first receive them, as the packaging looks great and they work decently enough when you first begin to use them, after figuring them out depending on if you have past experience with bluetooth headphones or not. If you do have past experience, you probably won't like these as much.<br /><br />The sound quality is ok, though it leaves much to be desire compared to other competing headphones. I immediately noticed that the sound was inferior to previous headphones that I had purchased, though it's not as if these headphoens have terrible quality. The price is good as well, but once again compared to other competing brands you would be able to find a superior product in the same price window. The earbuds don't fit too great depending on ear sizes and I have noticeably small ears, especially for the size of my head, so these can seem a bit taxing to wear after and extended usage.<br /><br />The overall look is nice, but at the cost of having uncomfortable plastic material that always feels like it is going to snap. As a matter of fact, my headphones did snap on one side, and it's not as if I employed heavy usage to these things to try and test their limits anyways. On top of the snapping, all of a sudden my headphone stopped functioning via the included wire, which is a crucial feature to have, as naturally the sound quality is better with a wire and I don't always have battery because of the somewhat poor battery life for these headphones. Because of the product trying to look &#34;cool&#34; like other popular competitors like Beats Headphones (which are an even more horrible investment) they sacrifice more sturdy and logical alternatives to make these headphones long lasting and high quality headphones.<br /><br />Even after all these problems, I hoped maybe a warranty would be able to fix something or try to at least get some help. Until I purchased these, I wasn't aware that I got them through Japan, though that is obviously my fault. Even after realizing that information, I wasn't aware how difficult it would be to try and set up any type of help with repair or warranty. I would contact audio-technica trying to get information, and they would tell me to contact the individual seller I (and you would/will have) purchased them from, and that they couldn't help me in this situation. Then I would contact the individual seller and after responding way later to my questions about warranty, they would try to tell me to contact audio-technica, ultimately proving to not be of any help. The confusing back and forth really rubs me a wrong way as a consumer and leads me to believe that I have been set-up a little bit in terms of warranty, but that is what it is, just wanted to warn anyone who was planning on purchasing these and thought they would be secure if problems occurred.<br /><br />All in all these wouldn't be the worst purchase to make, there are just better alternatives currently available on the market that will be less of a headache to deal with on the customer support side of things so I'd say stay away."
1,meets my expectations
-1,When it states wireless i was expecting something you charge and use to  charge your phone. Still needs a wire
1,It charges my phone perfectly
1,Would recommend this item to my friends.
-1,Doesn't  work  !!!!!!!
-1,"These headphones didn't work unless they where plugged in. When i had them plugged in to charge, it would show a red light for about a second, then turn blue. On the manual, the red means it's uncharged, and the blue means its fully charged. So, when i would unplug the headphones, they would turn off instantly, and i could not turn them back on unless i plugged them in. ( They were charging for 2 hours prior), Unless someone can help me, i give these 1 star."
1,Nice case. Everything ok
1,"Over all exactly what I expected, I knew I would be purchasing a knock off life proof and that's exactly what it is. Overall functions just like a normal life proof. Only bad thing is you have to take the case off every time you need to charge your phone."
1,I like the product and the service.
1,"Works great, I use it for my Microsoft Surface 3  2 phones and a Samsung 12.2 pro tablet  . Non of the plugs even get slightly warm. thank you Anker for making a great product that doesn't cost an arm and a leg."
1,"Yes. It met my expectations.  I love it, and I like your services.  Your company is good for whatever services you offer to the general public."
1,"I like the feel, the protection and how it swivels."
0,"Unfortunately, although this cable worked perfectly, it comes in my a-hole cat's favorite chewing color so it only lasted for a couple of days. If Samsung could make a white one that would shock my cat into the kitty underworld, I'd give this 5 stars. :)"
1,"Multiple people, multiple products, everyone happy.  iFlash 4-port USB car charger is a life saver.<br /> No more fighting over who gets to charge their phones or ipads.  I have regular cords and two 6 foot cords so that people in the back can charge at the same time.  This is a must!!<br />I have not noticed any charging concerns. Everyones phones and ipads charged at regular rates.<br />https://www.amazon.com/review/RSK4FZJ5TIIEQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm"
1,I love this cord! I've always used the 3feet cords and I'm so glad I had a chance to try this one. I don't think I will ever go back using or buying a shorter cord for my phone and iPad. This is so much easier and convenient. I love that I can use my iPad to read lying down in my bed while it is being charged. I don't have to worry about running out of battery. I've been using it for a while and so far it still works great. Although I received this cord free to try and review I will definitely buy it  when I need another one!
1,"Cute case. Can hold ID and a couple cards, but not cash and cards and ID because then it won't close. But overall, exactly what I wanted. Perfect for nights out on the town. Love the wristlet attached to keep hold of it!"
1,"Works great!  Very clear reception, and good enough distance (picks up about 15-20 feet away)"
1,Works great for my mom's phone.
1,"As much as I would like to give it 5 stars, it deserves a 4 (just because I'm nice), but maybe even a 3. The reason is that is uncomfortable to wear, as the phones weight brings the cardboard down on your nose, making it an annoyance and actually hurts my nose. So to fix it, I just a napkin to somewhat cushion it, though I am now looking into other products of better quality. This was a good introduction, and I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Though for the price range, I would look at other products that offer nose support, and I honestly believe they are overpriced and should at the most be $5, or less!"
1,Great product small easy to use and fits in your pocket 👍
1,This product came in on time and was exactly what I was expecting
1,Love the waterproof design and the capacity of this case bag. It can be used during beach day or for travel. Nice case.
1,"Worked as well as expected, still cardboard. Don't expect it to last forever."
1,Once charged it lasts for weeks without using it as often but still lasts a week or so using it daily. Love it!
1,"Both my ex husband and I own this phone and my mother, who had the latest iphone (as of 2015), HATED her IPHONE, but LOVED my Samsung Galaxy note 3. She's 91 and she found her apple product too non-intuitive. In 1 hour of instruction of her new SAMSUNG NOTE 3, she is operating her TV, has her UBER app set up, has her TV channel guide, learned how to do screen mirroring. Next lesson I'll show her how she can touch her phone to mine to share photos. I've had a lot of phones but this is hands down THE BEST phone I've ever owned. I watch Netflix if in the gym if Im just on the treadmill.  Verizon told me to find it on Amazon because they were or of them.  They've gone on to other newer models bit there's a good reason why this particular model is so popular.  I used this phone in europe as well. I went on $4.00 international plan with Verizon for a month, then when in Europe, I switched out the Sim card. Worked great. Switched Sims when done. Be sure to alway buy &#34;unlocked&#34; and the phone needs to work on your carrier's sustem. In my case, I bought a 900V (V is for Verizon)."
1,Worked great!
1,can't believe the deal I got. I received a discount on my order for a fair review. this is great!
1,"i bought this because i travel alot by car and i use waze,this i bought it for my brother"
1,Great value.  Cover goes on easy and stays on.  Can't beat the price compared to more expensive versions
1,What I expected
1,"Not what I expected!  The volume/pitch/clarity from the earpiece is EXCEPTIONAL.  I made two test calls- one to my Grandmother and one to my business partner and both had nothing but great reception and volume.  The button on the earpiece to hang up is AWESOME, wasn't expecting that!!  If you currently use one of those headsets that has the little speaker on the wire that hangs from your ear, making you hold the cord up to your mouth so people can hear you........STOP.  This will beat it all day everyday."
1,Great Product!!!!
1,Nice case works well not to bulky.
-1,"Horrible.  The distance between the earpeice and mouth peice is the distance from my ear to almost my belly button. If I somehow attach the mouth peice to my shirt collar (with a pin), then there isn't enough length to reach the walkie talkie (on my hip).  Unfortunately I waited too long to file a return now stuch with this peice which would only fit some mutant species that has a huge distance between their ear and mouth and have their wasit a mere inches from their mouth.  Not sure how this design got past any human that tried the product on themselves."
1,"Worked great, we will be ordering more"
1,Love it
1,Very good on my Mexican Telcel.
1,"&#34;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&#34;  That being said, I believe the price of $8.95 would be a good deal as well. The case comes safely packaged in a molded plastic container that is actually easy to open. It contains a neck strap and a belt clip so that you can wear it on your person either way. I believe both are sturdy enough for moderate physical activity. The case itself is a squishy plastic pouch that closes at the top with two plastic locks. It seems to lock tight and keeps the water out; although I don't know that I would want to keep it submerged for long periods of time. It is designed to float and I think that would be safe unless it is damaged. I plan on using mine mostly to guard against rain when I am out in bad weather or in the shower if I am expecting an important call, etc. The case I ordered fits my HTC One perfectly and allows me to operate the phone while it is in the pouch. It has a clear back window as well in case I needed to take a picture. Operating the phone a lot in the pouch may result in the phone heating up, so use it wisely. It also came with a small micro fiber cloth to clean your phone. The only slightly negative point is that the case is not yellow; it is more of a very light green. That is no big del for me as I mainly wanted it to be brightly colored to locate it in the dark, etc."
1,"Was a gift for my dad for Christmas, and he loves it!"
1,Great case
1,"The case fits well, all microphones have cutouts, it is exactly what I expected."
1,"Works seamlessly, no issues, overall pretty good."
-1,Returning!<br />The cover causes a halo affect when you are using the self facing camera.
-1,Quit Working after 2 months
1,It's great I use it everyday the battery is better then i imagined
1,Great product...
-1,The color fades away
-1,"VERY tight fit - I can barely slide the phone in. Also, the holes at the ends of the window opening don't line up with both the phone jack and the power button.  You have to slide the phone in upside down to be able to line up the phone jack. The circle &#34;home&#34; or &#34;wake-up&#34; button is pretty much covered up, so It's hard to hit that as well once the phone is in the case.  It was cheap, and I got my money's worth - NOT WORTH IT!!!"
1,Great
-1,The belt clip part broke 2 days after I got it
1,Great but the cord they gave for headphones sucks
-1,The quick charge only worked once and then it became even slower than a regular charger and sometimes it would not even charge my phone all the way.
-1,I have a galaxy s5 and it did not fit my phone.
1,"I bought one of these for my iPhone 5 and then when I upgraded to my 6+, I got this one.  I love this thing.  I use it mainly for my RFID access card at work.  I gave the iPhone 5 one to a fellow worker and he's completely given up carrying a wallet now.  He loves it too."
-1,Worked great
1,Love It Color AWESOME  :) :) :)
-1,"This item holds the phone for a selfie, but does not come with any means to take the picture from afar... uggh"
1,"Bought this to take with my to sporting events when I want to make sure I have battery life and don't want to carry a ton of stuff around with me. This certainly fits the bill! Fits in my purse, and I've had it a month (and taken it to 4 games) and haven't had to charge it other than the first charge yet! I plan on charging it before this weeks game just in case, but I bet it would last without it!"
1,I am still using this product!  My only complaint is that after months and months of use and being bitten on by my son; the rubber has started to bend easier and lift away from the hard shell.  It still works great!  The softer portion just becomes easier to pull on after a while.
1,My favorite case!  This case has endured hundreds of drops on concrete and tile with no damage.  My only issue is that the blue started to look dirty after awhile and I couldn't get the stains out.  I bought this same in case in grey so finger prints were not as noticeable.
0,"Product is quality I expected, but the international shipping is extremely slow."
1,"Stylish, elegant and looks expensive. It's fancy looking without being gaudy and it doesn't attract dirt, which is nice. I do wish there was just a bit more coverage on the top corners - if you push them back slightly the corner will pop right out. The slight contours fit nicely in your hand which really makes you want to hold the phone a lot. The contour is barely noticeable. I dont know why people say it does not sit flat on it's back because mine does. Looks beautiful with my gold iphone 6. Also I haven't had any trouble getting any cords into the jacks which I did with my lifeproof - even aftermarket charging cables with the larger heads fit fine."
1,It is too dark.  Cant even see through it.
-1,It was a really comfortable fit but I couldn't hear anything that was coming over the walkie which is kind of the point.
1,"Bought this for an old truck that only the radio works. Works great, little bit hissy just like listening to cassette tapes."
1,Love love love this case!
-1,The instructions are impossible and of no value. I am a 20 year veteran of offshore travels and have never had the poor assistance. I would not buy a Garmi
-1,eats up battery life.
-1,not happy at all with OEM I had to get one of my batterys replaced because one of them never worked when I received it then they sent me 2 more battery's and again one of them did not work I will not buy another battery from OEM again
1,This is the best phone holder I have seen in a long time!! Fits in cup holder and stays in place. Easy to use and holds phone tight!!
1,Good Product
1,"This thing is a monster!  Definitely not for the squeamish.  I think the 10&#34; tab would be right for most of the population but I like this thing a lot. The shock value alone is worth it.  Playing Clash of Clans on this with the stylus alone was worth the price of admission.  I picked up a refurbed one for $400 here on Amazon.  Great value.  I have a Surface Pro 3 with Win8 and I enjoy this more (at least until I upgrade the Surface to Win10?).  The size comparison between this and the Surface Pro 3 --  they are almost exactly the same in size, screen and all.  The only issue is I wish Samsung had a keyboard/mouse solution along the lines of the Surface Pro -- that is where the Surface Pro wins out.  Otherwise, if you want to go big, get this. I doubt they will ever come out with anything larger than this -- well, they really shouldn't but you know they probably will."
1,Yes it fit my iPhone 5s perfectly.
-1,It gets really dirty on the edges and you can't clean it no matter how hard you scrub.
1,works just like it should!
1,Item as described.
1,"Awesome looking case, makes the phone standout more than your average, cheaper cases. The one star off is for the case being a tad loose, it allows debris to enter the case and traps it there."
1,"It's inconvenient to carry, so I only use it on days when I know it's going to rain. I am personally fine with the fact that you can't really hear anything when the phone is on the case because that means its pretty much waterproof. It's perfect for concerts and festivals because then I don't have to worry about ruining my phone."
-1,"Great hardware, but android 5.0.2 is horrible. I wanted to love this phone because of the value it provides, but it's just a miserable experience with 5.0.2 and motorola is not clearly communicating when the phone will receive 5.1.x. It can take 20 seconds to switch from app to app or open apps due to 5.0.2's memory management bugs.<br /><br />I bought a used nexus 5 and I'm MUCH happier.<br /><br />Nexus IS android. Everyone else is just a middleman vendor that will end up frustrating you with non-support for your phone (be it security patches or just OS upgrades).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get a used nexus 5."
-1,Horrible
1,Good
1,Durable
1,"It took a bit to figure out a place to put it on my dash, but now that it's placed. I love it."
1,"I used to buy and use oem micro usb's often and I would usually get either the 3ft or 6ft because as much as I like the short ones, sometimes you need it to be longer for my portable battery chargers. When my portable chargers are not in use, I usually wrap my cables around it so I don't have tangled mess...for some reason these &quot;oem&quot; cables end up going back. I'm just glad to have that piece of mind of it not breaking, especially when I need it in an emergency. Not only do these look great, they are strong and durable as well! you can tell by just looking at them."
-1,"I bought this because 2 other reviewers said it worked with their SEEK, doesn't work with mine...."
-1,"Disappointed with the microphone on these, but I was reaching thinking they'd work for wireless calls. The audio was decent until they recently fell apart only four months after purchase. The glue holding the ear buds to the rest of the ear assembly mushed out."
0,I love this phone holder but the one problem is its rubber and I have an allergy to rubber so every time I hook it on my pants I get a rash would love to have this holder made with a regular plastic and not a rubber derivative disappointed
1,Nice fit.... looks and feels good
1,"The screen protector that I had on my tablet before was great and did its job well.  I dropped my tablet and the screen protector saved my devices screen from damage.  I was looking for the same screen protector that I had purchased before, but they are no longer available on Amazon.   I decided to give this product a chance and so far I am happy.  The screen protector arrived quickly and in great condition.  I opened it up and it includes an alcohol wipe, a dry wipe, and a sticker for removing small particles from your screen before applying the screen protector.  The quality is just as good as the more expensive one I had previously if not better.  It looks great, the cut outs are where they need to be, and the Samsung stylus works as it is supposed to.  I am happy with this purchase and I am confident that it will protect my screen in the event that I drop my tablet again."
1,Great case.. love the color.  Just wish it was a little thinner.
1,"Looks really nice.  Matches an aluminum Apple watch sport 42mm pretty well.  Comfortable to wear all day long, and seems pretty secure.  Very impressed."
1,Fast shippingz. Comes in a premium box. Looks like it'll last.
1,it covers my phone neat
1,"Truley amazing, Beautiful Apple Watch band alternative. Official one is over $130. Took one minute to open and switch it out for my Apple Watch sport band.It's awesome and good way to save money!"
1,"I wish I would have had this the day I bought my iPhone. The bevel protects the screen very well. The screen cover doesn't impede function or viewing. It is a bit bulky but I never notice the size unless I handle an iPhone without a cover. The port covers for the charger, headphones, etc are a bit annoying but I'd rather have them then not have them."
0,Holds phone firmly in place.
1,Fit's perfect
1,Worked perfectly for our Kindle as well as our Verizon ellipsis tablets. Best price I could find.
1,"I keep these in my car, briefcase and even 1 in my wallet. If I need a charge its usually not too difficult to find a micro USB."
1,Nice little 4G phone
0,met needs
1,Wonderful product. Great delivery turn around time!! Very pleased with the price and quality of the product!
1,Easy to use and sturdy. Applying the magnet was not an issue.<br /><br />Does not fall off on bumpy roads.<br /><br />Does block air flow from your vent a slight bit.
-1,Not worth it.  Either I gave it away or I tossed it
1,Love it!
1,The best phone at the best price! only need more optimization with Android and the memory RAM
1,Way better then that boring looking Apple watch. Love it!
1,Used these to replace some junk ones on some chargers I bought.  Tight reliable connection.  Highly recommend.
1,"work very well, no issues with it"
1,"I have always bought Spigen cases and so far the case has been great! It is thinner than the Tough Armor case.  It seems that it will protect my phone if it's dropped.  I see some of the issues that other people could have about the plastic breaking.  I don't take my case on and off often, so I hope I don't have the breakage problem.  Not bad for the price. The only complaint is that the color I chose was a bit darker than I expected."
1,"Loved the case and holster. The only drawback was the screen protector, did not lay flat against the phone so I removed it. Now it is perfect!"
1,"Use it on my motorcycle to keep my GPS phone charged on longer trips, camping trips, other longer outings. Can charge both my wife's and my phone at the same time and many times. Love it!"
1,Great product
1,"The case was received in perfect condition, promptly and as promised. Communication was appropriate and professional. A good product and service for a great price!"
1,Great price wife is loving it.
1,Bought it for the wife to use on her iPhone 6+.  She LOVES it!
1,"After researching the reviews, I ordered two cables.  These are everything the great reviews claim them to be.  As a matter of fact, count me among the reviewers who claim them to be sturdier and more substantial than the original cables that came with our iPhones.  The added length is a huge bonus, as well.  I'll be ordering more soon."
1,Good item and good price
1,Great charger! Awesome light!
-1,The screen arrived at my home broken.
1,"Love this case! The looks is classy and elegant, albeit bulkier than I like, and does the job well. I constantly get compliments of this case. It's unique. Other than the bulk, I wasn't crazy about the fact it cannot be removed without breaking it...or I haven't figured out how to do it! That isn't enough to make me not love it, and it forces me to use my iPod (which has been useless since I bought a lighting adapter to use apps like waze and pandora in my car). I constantly drop my phone (never in a way that wouldn't harm a phone, always from a high place and usually on concrete/rocks/cobblestone...I know, why not learn to be more careful OR get a lifeproof case, not my style). My phone has been dropped MULTIPLE times over the past 10 days while on vacation in a foreign country (and honestly the last thing I want to buy is something practical, or a cell phone case I don't even like). It had a couple of bits on the bottom near the charging/headphone ports come off after 2-3 traumatic falls, but my phone was still in tact with no scrapes/scratches.<br /><br />This case is fantastic! Yes, it broke. Yes, I have to replace it...and I'm replacing it with the same exact case. Why? Because I didn't have to but some random, ultra ugly case for an exorbitant price (that may or may not actually protect my phone), and I would do it again over and over to avoid replacing my phone...which costs significantly more than this case. I'm just sayin'.<br /><br />This is my first review on any product. That is how strongly I feel that it's worth purchasing (if you don't mind not being able to take off the case -which technically doesn't bother me because I now use the iPod I bought so I don't have to listen to the radio) or the bulk (also not a deal breaker for me since it's stylish enough and the size of the iPhone 6 forces me to actually carry a purse larger than a wristlet anyway)."
1,"This is probably the best phone mount I've ever owned. Solid, sturdy, and fits a Nexus 6. Would definitely buy this again."
1,I really like this. It reminds me of the Outer Box but at a lower cost. The only thing I wish they had would be the plastic guard for screen.
0,"Works great when it works. I have been using the Unite for months now and it has an annoying (to say the least) habit. IT WILL INTERMITTENTLY DISCONNECT internet from the laptop.The device will be connected windows will show a connection, the Mi-fi shows a connection, but nothing. The solutions are wait and hope it reconnects after about 15 minutes. Reset the Mi-fi and hope it reconnects properly (50/50 chance). Lastly you can run a troubleshoot and windows will identify the problem as a loose or disconnected internet cable and fix the problem. Obviously there are no wires so I am at a loss. What I do know is that it sucks when you're half way through Veep and the connection stops. I have also talked with a neighbor with the same device that experiences the same issue with their Unite. BATTERY LASTS FOREVER."
1,Excellent Thank You..
1,It is simple and easy to place it on my iPad Air 2
1,Best buy for its money ! Came with screen protection film. Love it !
1,"Best screen protectors ever. I accidentally put it on upside-down the first time, but once I tried the second time it wrnt perfectly. No bubbles, and is very smooth but not a weird matte like feel to it. I have only used one for several months and it doesn't look like it's coming off any soon. Would definitely buy again if I needed to!"
0,"Nice case, fits the phone well, but the front is very loose, opens really easily. Not sure I'd be comfy with leaving my stuff in there."
1,"Make sure you watch the video on how to install. Everything in the kit makes applying the screen protector so much easier and it doesn't leave behind lint or residue.<br /><br />So far I am happy with the screen protector. I previously had an ZAGG Invisible Shield which cracked a couple weeks after I bought it and I hadn't even dropped my phone. It eventually completely shattered and even though I had a warranty on it, I didn't think it was worth it so I did some research and found the Maxboost which has excellent ratings and is half the price of the ZAGG shield.<br /><br />It overs more of the phone than ZAGG and is easier to install. I feel confident that it will protect my phone."
1,Looks great with good cutouts
1,perfect
1,Real nice n sturdy. My wife really liked it. I did too. Should do the job n keep that $500 phone safe.
-1,Poor product
-1,this was a bad purchase
-1,Not working
1,"Very Acceptable, works as advertised."
-1,"Case is nice, but the button covers are difficult to press especially the. Also the outside black bumper makes a white iPhone look cheap. I will probably buy a different case soon because I am not happy with this one. Only thing that was nice was the picture."
-1,worked good for 1 yr then went belly up. no customer service and no one will work on it
0,"Eh, could have been better made. Arrived quickly though."
1,"I have very small arms and was pleased when I put this on and it fit comfortably. I was able to put my phone in the pocket with the case on which was also nice, as they can be difficult to get on and off. I have not gone on an extended run yet but so far am pleased with my purchase."
1,"Bought my second one last week for my wife's car. So far, these cables seem to hold up much better than the other cables we've purchased online and in stores."
1,I like the easier access when I'm charging my phone. BAD THING IS ONE OF THE 2 I ORDERED WORKS. Wish both did.
1,I've used this a few times already since purchasing it. It keeps the phone dry and I don't even notice it's on my arm while running. Thanks!
1,perfecto
-1,too chunky and thick to be used with iPad or iPhone case on devices.
-1,This product does not function properly  https://youtu.be/AoBPZm8xcys
1,Super fast delivery! Quality is amazing! It feels so good holding it in my hands!
1,Its light and fits perfectly.
-1,Doesn't have an opening for the off and on and the volume other than that it would have been fine you literally have to take the device out of the case just to turn it on and off.
1,This case fits my phone perfectly and offers great protection from me dropping the phone or getting knocked about while it's in my pocket.
1,"GOOD: Really good quality rubber on the inside lining and good non-slip hard outer cover. Last case I had my phone slipped in every surface, luckily this one is sticky enough but not too bad for pockets and very slim. Although, if wearing slim or skinny pants, you will prefer taking the phone without a case, with normal pants I can't feel it there.<br /><br />BAD: The only drawbacks are the lettering on the side &#34;Lightning Knight&#34; sounds like a 8-year-old wrote it, and the top and bottom sides where the ports are do not  have the hard shell protection, only the flexible rubber protects it from a straight-down fall. The hard shell does cover the sides and all the back of the phone."
-1,"This thing is hard to put together. I mean, granted, I didn't read the directions, but how hard could it be? unscrew some stuff, clip it on, put the base holding the phone on. 1. it doesn't lock the base on. 2. it moves constantly. 3. once you remove the ball that allows you to adjust the angle, you can't get it back on. Not as great as people made it out to be, but it's a decent purchase and if I had to do it again, I would have liked to know that the thing actually holding your phone doesn't actually lock onto the rest of the apparatus.  Update: 9-21 about a year after purchase It broke clean off where the suction cup is glued to the plastic. How unfortunate. It wasn't a great product to begin with and now because it is not sturdy or long lasting, I've downgraded from 3 stars to 1 star."
1,"I have been privelaged enough to actually sample quite a few products from Joto and all of their products are great quality and nicely priced. I did receive this G4 phone case at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. This case is for the LG G4, the case itself is clear so you can actually show off your brand new phone. A lot of people don't like that most cases actually hide your phone and people do care or they wouldn't make phone color options like white, black, silver etc...So this allows you to display your phone while adding that much needed protection that all phones need. Snaps on nice and easy, no modifications whatsoever are needed. All functions of the phone are uninterrupted, so all in all this is a 5 star case in my opinion.<br /><br />I did receive this phone case at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review!"
-1,"This is a waste of money, even though I think I only spent less than $10 for the kit.  I consider myself a fairly decent computer/gadget tech and this is beyond anything a non-expert can perform.  I strongly suggest to anyone interested in this to reconsider and just buy the $80 kit."
1,"detector works very well, and looks like a premium model."
1,"It charges quickly, 5 to 6 full charges, and still have power. I love it!"
1,Easy to use and good price :)
0,Good deal but they look a bit grainy.
-1,Broke within a couple weeks
1,Got this a year ago and still works great! My mom uses it most of the time though haha.
1,Works as advertised.  Uset the tools to remove a dash panel in an expedition.
1,"Excellent product a lot of use-full features not like many others with useless bells and whistles. it's very practical. Instruction manual very well put together. Radio signal is excellent, I love the I phone pairing feature<br />. I am using this radio on a boat and before with older radio I could only catch couple stations. But now is so many to choose from. This radio is so so smart it practically does every thing for you. when you set it on automatic set up. I love my new toy.<br />I would recommend this radio at any time."
-1,"Military grade supposedly, back of samsung S6 is shattered. No cracks in case or no holes but phone is shattered on back."
1,item works without any issues
-1,Could not hear it at highway speeds.
1,"These earbuds came exactly as advertised. The sound is clear, even at higher volume levels (please do not play music too loud). I have used the microphone sparingly, and there does not seem to be any problems associated with it as well. The only caveat to these is the material does not seem to be as high quality as the ear pods that were originally shipped with my iPhone. However, the price was great nonetheless.<br /><br />If anything does come up during longer use with this product, I hope I can return and add a supplement to this review. The seller far exceeded my expectation of the delivery of these ear pods, and has been easy to work with."
1,It looks cool and charges faster than a regular one.
1,Greatness!
1,Not a bad case. Feels good in my hand. Doesn't slip out of my grip. Looks nice and thin but still provides decent protection. Fits the edge screen nice. Only issue is that when removing phone it's a little tough and the metal band around the case  will occasionally pop off but is easy to slide back on.
0,was surprised to find that it was just a flimsy rubber and minimal plastic hard case.
-1,Hard to install collected lint. And the other ones got stuck to the paper. What a waste
-1,"Ordered this phone and everything worked great for the first 33 days, on the 34th day the camera quit working and the phone gets too hot to hold it in your hands. Of course the return policy is only good for 30 days, so I'm out 240 bucks. I don't recall ever leaving a negative review on amazon.com before this one. I was so excited about it too."
1,I love this Blue tooth It blocks out the majority of background noise It is very comfortable as I have littler ears than most & most other blue tooth's hurt my ear's & I love it that they added a volume up down feature as well! I recommend this dealer as it comes in a very nice box/case & other's in bulk packaging do not work as well as this one! It also holds a charge for a long time & it barely takes a little over 5 minutes to charge
1,Charges my phone multiple times.
1,This unit resolves our powering predicament and seems to work exactly as advertised.
1,"These are great Headphones! I wish I would have invested in the earlier. I workout with these every day and I have had no problems with them. I usually cannot keep earbuds in my ears for the life of me, but these stay in regardless of what I am doing. I keep my phone in a backpack in the corner of the gym and can move about everywhere and not lose signal. I have also used these on a plane and they do an excellent job of blocking out any noise. Sometimes I don't even realize the flight attendant is talking to me. I would definitely recommend buying these."
1,NICE BUT I THOUGHT i WAS RECEIVING 2 INSTEAD OF ONE
1,"Happy with it.  I've used a few times now, and it does a great job.  Is the same size as my phone, so they fit together nicely in my pocket or purse pocket."
1,Quick service excellent product
0,"I love the case that replaces my wallet. I like the look as well. Unfortunately, just like so many other reviewers, the plastic that is suppose to hold the phone in the case has been cracking and falling off. I see some reviews where this happened as soon as one month and some about two, I guess I am not as hard on my case because I have had mine for about 5 months. I doubt it will last much longer, the last piece hold one side on is actually held with superglue currently. I might actually buy it again, ten bucks for something that works for 5 months isn't too bad in my opinion. Just be warned, if you are tough on cases, drop your phone, sit on it, or even plan to take it out of the case often, this will not be a long lasting option for you."
1,I like them better then the beats I spent 179$ on.
1,"Wow, now have a phone without contract and it works great."
1,best  selfie stick
1,great
1,"This provided me the charge to fill up my phone's battery many times over, and it will last a long time if you don't need to use it, so you don't need to worry if you forget to charge it"
1,"I just got this in the mail today and I really like the case. However, the picture definitely makes it look brighter and more eye-catching than it really is. It still looks great though and matches the picture. Also, it fits my phone perfectly!"
1,just as described.  arrived like 2 weeks before the delivery date provided
1,"I just got this handy little guy to throw in my purse. As I am handicapped with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, I depend on my iPhone and iPad now for everything. I'm so glad I don't have to worry about the battery dying in a dr's appointment!!!"
1,Nice as describe also good shipping
1,it's okay!
1,My wife loved it!
-1,started fine...then the sound started to get static. now it disconnects at least once an hour with a sound that comes in an out and pauses and starts at random. save your money.
1,Love it!
1,Would be nice if the glass was a bit bigger. This glass seems to attract fingerprints. Was an easy install...
1,Really liked this screen protector untill I dropped the phone.  From a height of 2ft the screen protector broke at the top.  Kind of disappointing and concerning.
-1,"Cheap,the colors are faded and the white is more of a dingy yellow and the gold is just brown, it does not look like the picture at all. But it has a nice finish. Very thin, not worth the price its listed as."
-1,"It's pretty. It's light.  But it only charges my phone one and half times before dying.  If you want capacity, don't buy this."
1,"Great price - the case seems very secure, and the iphone is easy to use with it - don't have problems with the volume control, etc., that other people have commented on.  My one complaint is that there were no instructions, and I had a hard time getting the case OPEN so that I could insert my phone - there were no instructions on the website, so I googled it, and finally found a you-tube video that explained it.  Otherwise I'm happy!"
1,Love this wallet camera case.  It is holding up much better than the cheaper versions.
-1,"after the second use it stopped charging via the sun. And since I didn't use it immediately, it's ineligible for return.  Fairly useless as solar products go. Don't buy it."
-1,"Cute, but does not fit the Samsung 6 edge!"
1,It's great for that price you get something that looks good feels good.
1,Fits the phone well and gives good protection .Easy to install .
1,"Best headphones. It has 3 buttons that let you switch between calls and music with one touch at ease, and controls the music as well. I don't need to touch my phone when I am running outdoor work. I got it as free though. I am having nice experience with it."
1,"It works as expected. I have an Anker battery pack and have been very pleased with it. Before I purchased the battery pack Anker was not a brand I was at all familiar with. After purchasing this, Anker has become a reliable/ dependable name to where I feel comfortable purchasing any of their products without any hesitation.<br /><br />The overall build of the charger is strong. Even though it's case is plastic, it is sturdy and will take a good beating. With most accessories that have a plastic case it feels brittle and hollow. This is solid, it does not feel like there is a tiny little circuit board with usb sockets on it wrapped in a case three times the size of the circuit board. the pins on the DC plug are hard. It takes a lot to move it out of position to loose continuity in my p.o.s. vehicle."
1,Really good
1,Good one!
-1,Computer does not recognize it as a compatible cable.
1,works great and my kids love it!
1,"Feeling stupid.  Reading the description and doesn't state these are sold in pairs.  It states &#34;speaker harness&#34;, which I took as one.  So, I definitely have extra now..  Great product overall!!"
1,"I bought this battery due to a great deal on the price I saw on an Internet deal site. I didn't really have high expectations but I was very pleased when it arrived and I took it out of the packaging. It has a sleek finish, not as heavy as I expected and feels solidly constructed. I charged it and then put it to the test. I charged a Galaxy 5S smartphone from below 20% battery to fully charged 5 times! This is perfect for me when I go camping or on long motorcycle trips. Don't have to pack a tangle of chargers and cords."
1,Everything perfect
-1,I change this and didn't work I try to reset the system and didn't helps
1,Great product
1,love it
1,Love the length.  I only wish they made these with replaceable tips.  I also have the shorter ones with replaceable tips and it's just plain smarter and &#34;greener&#34; to replace tips rather than throwing the pen away.
-1,It broke easily
1,Great Apple Watch stand.
1,I liked receiving a 3 pack because I'm not that good at putting on screen protectors but having the 2 layer on these helps greatly!  The final layer helps keep the screen protector stiff so that it's easier to apply as well as protects your screen protector from getting scratched when removing the air bubbles.<br /><br />I didn't do too bad and a trick I learned was to use the sticky side of scotch tape to remove any lint that may get on the sticky side of the screen protector.  This covered most of the screen like other ones I've used.  The phone case covers the rest.<br /><br />The antiglare feature is a must have these days!<br /><br />I receieved a discount on this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  5 stars are never guaranteed but this product was exactly what I expected!
-1,broke the first time I used it
1,"It was a gift and my Son which uses daily to reach out to business associates loves it! Ease of use and features are outstanding,"
-1,Nothing like what u see online wish I never purchased it
0,"Works exactly as it should, but being reconditioned it definitely feels like the plastic shell has been replaced with the cheapest kit possible. I haven't had one of these phones for years but I remember them feeling much more solid/sturdy than this."
1,Works great.  Very sticky surface.  Hopefully it won't leave a residue on my car dashboard but will need to leave it for a while in order to be sure.
1,Cute
1,Screen protector is good quality but too small for the phone screen; perhaps it is meant to be covered by the case?
1,"Amazing watch, great, quick shipping. Wife is amazed at how powerful the watch is and all it does."
1,"Very cool, light, good sound, simple; I like it a lot."
1,"I have been using this product, for a month now and it works really well. I have had lots of charger cables in the past but this is the best hands down"
1,Great fit and comfortable
1,"Brought this for my husband and he loves it. I held it a few times, and the case makes the phone feel nice in the hand."
1,"This battery is amazing!  Even on the very first charge, I got over 36 hours usage out of this thing.<br /><br />After my first full discharge and recharge, I got 65 hours usage out of it with my normal habits that involve regular amounts of youtube, texting and other programs.<br /><br />The included case is of relatively high quality as well, comparable to the Otterbox case I had on it with my stock battery.<br /><br />Instructions are clear and this thing will turn your phone into a thick heavy brick (approx. 1 inch thick) but the sheer amount of power you get out of this is well worth it."
1,i love it
1,Works great attached to my tripod to take product pictures with my light box
1,"When it comes to easy to use, durable, and amazing phone mounts the Spigen Stealth is AMAZING! I use it every weekend when I drive for Lyft, and I get compliments at how sleek and out of the way it is compared to other phone mounts (and I have dead center in the car). I am able to mount and unmount the phone with a single hand, so there is never a sketchy moment where I am not holding the wheel (I never manipulate the phone while driving... SWEAR!!!). The only downside I have experienced is that some apps just don't have landscape mode, but Google Maps does... so yeah, this is a small downside."
1,"We have owned this charger for five months. It works great with our Apple Products: iPad Mini, iPad Retina, iPhone 5 and iPhone 6. It charges our devices as quickly as the chargers that came with them. Never have had any issues with it.<br /><br />I do wish I had read other reviews about the insanely bright blue light that emits from this charger when it is plugged in. I wish that it did not have this, but it does remind us to unplug it when not in use."
1,"i received this product free for review and it works great. i love that i can still see my screen on teh front, but the back is still protected by this case! it was easy to put on and fits perfectly."
1,"Just as cute in person as in the picture, and has protected my phone just fine!"
0,Case arrived quickly.  It was missing the piece that screws into the headphone jack making it not waterproof.  Cannot get the switch to make it vibrate to work while case is on
0,"The battery is a little weak, but all else is working properly and in good condition ."
1,just what I wanted. Nice fit.
1,Fits my phone perfectly and I've been getting a lot of compliments.
1,Great deal on multi colored charms. They hold up well and don't break too easily. Lots of bold colors in the mix.
1,Great sound quality and comfortable
-1,"Fit the Note 3 fine, but doesn't hold a charge any better than the 16 month old OEM battery. Should have paid a little more for a higher quality replacement."
1,This is better than the cord that comes with the iPad 2 which eventually wore out.
1,Easy to stick and strong on daily use!
-1,"Very poor quality and doesn't fit my phone.  The edges don't stretch to cover the entire phone and the color is not at all like the picture.  It is more of a dark yellow color.  The cover is flimsy and does not give any protection to the phone.  Also, the shipping took a long time-- over 2 weeks.  I do not recommend.<br /><br />I received a discount for my honest opinion."
1,Good quality
1,"Perfect fit for my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Note 4. It's lightweight and not at all bulky but very durable,strong and snug on my phone.  I've dropped my phone a few times and is been perfectly protected by this. Highly recommend!"
-1,This start to broke the second day of used. I received the phone on wesneday and by friday it was crake on the top left. See the picture below.
1,Saved my iPhone 6 from a disaster. Great warranty service as well. The protector does not have the best coverage.<br /><br />EDIT: Looks like the newer version has a better screen coverage compared to the pre release versions Tech Armor released
-1,"I was very disappointed in this.  It is very cheap looking.  I assumed this was like a statue when comparing it to the other similar products for sale, but it is actually a piece of plastic.  The man is hollow.  If you look closely at the picture you can see the arm and leg lines.  It is hard to explain.  It you want something rudimentary and basic, this will work.  If you are looking for a classy way to store your phone, keep looking."
1,works great
1,Love it
0,Looks good and fit well but really doesn't glow after 15-20 mins
1,Nifty little product!
1,I keep my Garmin in it at all times when not in use. Fits like a glove.
1,works great.
1,i like it!
1,"Ports seem a bit tighter than the stock part, but they work just as well. Installation was fairly easy by watching videos on YouTube. Just be careful when removing the screen. I wasn't as careful as I should have been and it seems as though I may have damaged some of the ribbon cables - now my home button doesn't work and there are horizontal lines running through the screen. But now my phone charges so at least I can use it. By using jailbreak/Activator I have been able to get around the home button issue."
-1,covers mouth area so it's hard for the other person to hear you
1,Worked great in a 2000 ford windstar the pocket works good to store the aux cable when not in use.
1,"Works well, does what it should. Well worth the price."
1,"pretty good product, as a Soldier that just used this in the field recently this came in very handy. Product was durable as it was banged around in the vehicle.  No issues with the seller and I look forward to dealing with the seller in the future for future field product.  I actually have Army buddies that are interested in purchasing one for themselves.  Guess whole squad will have one then the platoon.  That's how good the product is.  I guess you can say its Soldier tested and Soldier approved."
-1,Case does not fit my 5s properly on the sides and credit card does not fit either.<br />Returning this immediately.<br />Would not recommend.
1,"Tech Armor<br />Easy to apply, clear, no bubbles, no hassle. Let the protection begin."
0,I strongly advise taping your cord so that it doesn't bend near the microUSB port too much. I bought 2 and the first one bent too much and broke after 2-3 months. I've taped my second one so it won't bend (see picture)
1,"Great product, worth the small amount it cost."
-1,"It says retail packaging, but it comes in a white box, definetely not retail."
0,You get exactly what you see except the colors are more vivid. If you like bling and the convenience of a small wallet this is perfect for you. I have received so many compliments and love the case. I am ordering another one in a different color as a gift.<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010D43HSE/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
1,I love this lil gadget.very accurate
1,"Good stylus, arrived as expected.  Other tips provide a slightly quicker response, but this is pretty good."
1,"I love this elegant, no-fuss, portable sound amplifier for my iPhone! It's easy and durable. When I don't need it to amplify, I prop my phone horizontally across the top of the sound pod to use it as a phone stand."
1,Very nice.  Fits exceptionally well.  Daughter loves the color.
1,"awesome backup battery charger. I've put this charger through the test. I live in the Desert  (92254) and out here it gets warm. this device keeps up with me, iv taken it on road trips, office use, recreation, camping, fishing (in Zip Lock bag of course) and every wear in between. my kids get it from me to charge their cell phones and tablets. this is the second Anker charger I own, first charger is the Anker Astro 5. oh and I charge them with my Anker 14W folding solar panel. and they go every wear I go. I put them in my little Bug out Bag. I recommend this to the average traveler on the go."
-1,A bit disappointed that the screen protectors do not completely go to the edge of the screen. There's a gap between the screen protector and the edge of the screen and every case I have put on pushes the screen protector back up.
-1,I really expected better from the Amazon name. The sheathing cracked and separated from the wires at the lightning connection end within a couple of weeks. Very disappointed.
1,This works great for my phone and hubby's!  Wish I had bought more!
1,"Got this for my 3 year olds ipad mini, and he loves it. he drops it, throws it, and it has no issues keeping up with his lifestyle."
0,it is ok but lost pic on hot days mounted in bed of pickup truck
1,"This device flat out works, this is by far the easiest way to track your miles and keep a log for the IRS that I have come across, plug it in and forget about it. OR go one step further like I did and go to best buy and have them hard wire it and install it under my dash board. Customer service has been outstanding both times I have had a need for it. I can not say enough good things about the way I was treated by the customer service rep and how happy I am with the device.<br /><br />Dave Mac"
1,can still see the original phone color come through yet provides good protection. Nice tight fit and slim I have watched my kids drop their phones on concrete or asphalt multiple times with this cover doing its job.
1,Product does a great job at protecting my ipod. Great feel and fits good. The cover does come over the edges all around which is great. Would have 5 stars if it was a lil tighter fit.
1,Nice
1,"Received the free samples,we are so pleased with this waterproof phone pouch/case.It can work for iphone6 plus and fits perfect, we are out on a boat, that will go fast and bounce and things can fall off even if you are taking care. So we trusted this pouch to protect the phone if it was to have a fall over into the water. No one wants to think there phone will fall in water or get dirt all over it. So it is best to be prepared, It can also hold a credit card or some cash too, It has a strap that you could tie to something or hook on your wrist as well. It is easy to put the phone in and out is just slides in or out, and there is two locking tabs on the top that seals it.<br />I received a free or discounted product for a honest and unbiased review. All statements are true.I received this product for free on exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,"Works just as advertised.  Easy to use, fits both Galaxy 5 and iPhones.  Charges quickly and is a great gift for children or adults.  Plan to purchase several for Christmas Presents."
-1,"I bought this for kayaking thinking it would be great seeing as how it would never go directly in the water.  The first case I ordered immediately got my phone wet.  I was able to save the phone but requested a replacement case.  I received the second case and it worked for about 3 weeks.  After some splashes water made it's way into my phone and now I have a fried iPhone 6,  DO NOT RISK YOUR PHONE!!!!"
1,Excellent...
1,I love this case...especially the fact that it wraps all the way around to the edges. The graphics are clear and look quite good.
-1,"Lasted just over 30 days before they stopped working.  If you are a runner, don't buy these they are pathetic."
1,Hasn't broken on me and they offer a lifetime guarantee so far I'm happy with them
0,"2/5 broke already. I've had them and used them for less than a year. But when they work, they work really well."
1,Tough case
-1,Only shows 0.31 amp and takes ages to charge 1%. This is worse than my cheap old ($1.00) charger. False marketing
-1,"The worst purchase I ever made. These things skip all the time, even if I'm standing and my phone is at my hip. I tried endlessly experimenting with the combination of the different sized ear buds and the pieces that fit around them that were provided but no luck. Huge waste of money. They fall out all the time much less with the slightest amount of sweat. Seriously junk."
1,It works perfectly.  I love it.  delivery was quick and I am fully satisfied.
1,Works great but after a few months it rotates around freely. Nothing a little bit of glue didn't fix.
0,Not impressed with long-term use.
0,"I had the Jawbone Up 24 for about two years until it finally died.  I loved it.  I called Jawbone and asked for suggestions.  He recommended the Jawbone Up Move this time. I ordered the clip and the bracelet.  I've had it for about three weeks now.  I have not used the clip but I use the watchband which is quite cheesy.  Aside from the looks, I know I'm going to lose it!!!  It keeps falling off; luckily, I found it!!  If I lose this, I'm going to switch to another brand.  I really don't want to lose it!!!!"
1,Work good
-1,Do not buy these. They sound terrible
1,"I love this case! Low profile, yet protective.  Looks great on my iPhone 5c."
1,"delivered on time,great condition,works wonderful easy to set up, I love it"
-1,This did not work with my iCarez privacy screen protector. This works on my iphone but I would not recommend. Spend an extra few bucks on an adonit brand stylus. I borrowed a friends that works great.
1,Very good and light no bulk added to phone
1,Excellent product…what you see is what you get…
1,"Great Silicone Case for the tablet.  Does make it a little hot while on, but not too bad that it affects it in anyway."
-1,It doesn't exactly fit the phon . Its to big it just falls off.
1,very good case for the money and wears well so far.  It also has a funky pattern on the back side!!
1,Durable
1,"Great products, great service ! As always, these guys make premium products at a good price !"
-1,"It is TINY and came all bent up in an envelope, so it's pretty much useless. You get what you pay for.... when will I learn that??"
1,I am happy with this charger. Charged it first in the house and plugged it into my phone that night.
1,Absolutely love this case
1,Simply great
0,i like it but it kind go. off the screen some time hv to stick it bk<br />but its okay
0,I recently purchased the 2 gb RAM version of this phone. The HD display is beautiful and it takes great pictures but when I discovered 1.5 gb of the RAM were consumed by google play and the other bloatware it came pre-installed with I sealed it right back up and returned it.
1,Love it like I'm dying
-1,One of them stopped working which sucks. Other than that they are great.
1,Fits perfectly and it's as clear and beautiful as the original one I paid 3x more for.
1,very good
1,"I have gone through plenty of cables during my tenure with iPhones. Most are flimsy and poorly built and do not last long. I purchased this cable after buying other Tech Armor products and seeing that they are quality built and designed to last and do what their designed to do, PROTECT! I have used this cable for about 2 days now and you can feel the quality in the cable braid and the ends. I feel this cable is going to be with me for some time but if it ever fails, Tech Armor has a lifetime warranty. I have already had to use the warranty with my glass protection which absorbed the blow from a remote control that was thrown towards me but landed right on my phone. It took the blow and saved my screen!! There warranty is truly hassle free! You can't go wrong with Tech Armor!!<br />(Update) 9/7/15 After using this now for over a week I wanted to add that my charging time on my iPhone 6plus has decreased dramatically. It takes about 20 mins to go from 15% to 97% using my iPad mini charging block. I attribute this to the high quality materials used."
1,"Amazing, I put them in my 2002 Jetta and they were able to kick some decent bass. For about 30$ a pair, they were really impressive"
1,"If you have a motorcycle then this is the one you want.  Before this one I bought an el cheapo plastic one that I didn't even get installed before it broke.  Before I bought it, I noticed one reviewer complained that the rubber grips came off.  I thought that I could just put glue on it if I saw this being a problem.  Well when it arrived, the instructions said to super glue them on if you plan on using the device on a motorcycle or in rough conditions.  I have been riding at 70mph all night and my Samsung Galaxy S5 has not moved an inch.  I have a Galaxy S1 that I will use with it as well.  Will probably buy another one."
1,"Love the case, highly recommend it ☺very good quality for the price 👌"
1,"Arrived when promised, delivered what we expected."
1,"Great receiver, especially for the price, only wish it had come with the mounting bracket and wiring harness from my vehicle.  The information wasn't quite clear on what was included and/or required for he installation.  Regardless, the receiver works great and easily pairs with my phone for IM, phone and musing control.  The Aux and USB interfaces work great, and the USB port charges my phone at the same time - great benefit!  The interface is fully customizable, to the point where it may be overwhelming to some.  I enjoyed the vast array of configs so that I could make the interface my own.  The receiver does a good job of pushing out a high quality audio experience which on it's own is quite loud enough for my enjoyment!"
1,It is just as I expected
1,REALLY NICE FOR THE PRICE
1,Thank you for a great product at an unbeatable price
1,"Nice case for the price, works great"
1,Love it
1,like this
-1,"Pros:<br />-This is an interesting device. Great for school age kids, not allowed to carry cell phones in school or are playing out of immediate adult supervision.<br />- GPS live tracking software is very accurate.<br />- Calls like a regular cell phone.<br />- Downloading the app was super easy.<br />- Device usage simple for kids.<br />Cons:<br />- Product description DOES NOT speak to: impact durability, sweat or water resistance, or temperature extreme limitations (important when purchasing a product for active school age children).<br />- Battery comes connected. DONT accidentally disconnect the battery while removing the battery packaging. It is VERY difficult to reconnect.<br />- Use CAUTION when removing the battery packaging as it contains the IMEI & ID number. (NEEDED to activate the SIM card).<br />- Setting the time was a small chore. ALL EST zone folks, you will need to manually enter (-4) in the time zone application set-up. This info is not in the directions.<br />- Directions are incredibly vague. You will have to trial and error with the phone and software.<br />- CHARGER is NOT a micro USB 5V. I repeat, the charger is NOT a micro USB 5v!!!!!!!! It is a two prong connection and I am still trying to find out what it is called."
-1,"Like at least one other reviewer I experienced a very concerning issue of overheating during charging. I had plugged it into a USB adapter (the one that came with my iPhone) and left it for several hours.  I got back some hours later to find the headset extremely hot; also the charger was hot, as was the USB cable.<br /><br />Following this the headset will not power on and the plastic casing (right side, where the battery apparently is) is distorted from the heat.<br /><br />It had successfully charged about three times previously (via a USB port on a laptop, versus the Apple adapter).  Total usage about 6 hours within one week; now it is in the trash.<br /><br />Shockingly bad, not to say possibly dangerous."
-1,Not adequate.
1,Works as described.
1,works perfect
1,"i have had the case for around a year and it is great! amazing how this thin layer of protection has held up, i love the feel and how it grips to surfaces so it doesn't slip. Another great product from NOOT!"
-1,"The cord is nice and long, the issue is that the micro usb portion does not make a great connection within my products.  Basically the hardware doesn't fit and thus does not charge either my phone or Kindle unless I push down on the cord while it is plugged in.  For me this was a waste of money."
-1,I haven't tried this as a waterproof case and I don't want to after reading the other reviews. BUT I plan to use when we are going somewhere that it might get a little wet.. like the water resistance feature. Even snow when we go on walks. I can do that and feel okay. It is really thick and bulky though. I would kind of expect that though.<br /><br />*Disclaimer: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my HONEST review.
1,always cheapest through amazon. crisp clear and no static. multi-functional as stated.
1,perfect fit.Nice Look. I love it
1,It's only I don't like the sound not loud
-1,The case did not come with the bow and the rhinestones come off very easily.
1,Very nice product.
1,I was very satisfied with the delivery time and the product.
1,i really like this case it fits very well and it has a cute and cool design to this case its a very soft silicone thats very protective.
1,Love it !
0,"I bought mine at a local retailer about 6 months ago, now being Aug. 31. It was great at first but now it loses about 25% of its charge in just a day or two. I have to charge this thing every day if I want a reliable source of power. For $30 bucks or so more you can get an Anker® with 25,000+ MAH and its only a little larger than this thing. Not worth the $30!"
1,"RECIEVED THE COVER TODAY,I LIKE IT VERY MUCH"
1,Thanks.  Sk8Maui.com MauiStyleAloha.com
1,All Great!
1,"The quad lock rocks!  I love the speed of connecting my phone (under 2 seconds) and removing it (also under 2 seconds).  I have one on both my road bike and my mountain bike.  The poncho works when it rains, although I have not been in a heavy storm with it.  The only issue I have found is the mount attachment bands break too easily.  The zip ties are more permanent, but feel less tight than the rubber bands.  After my bands broke, I decided to go with my own rubber bands and keep a few handy in my bike bag."
1,"This is great, even fits my I-phone with it's bulky protection case"
0,"I expected with it being duracel, it would give my phone more of a charge.  It only charged it about 30%.  I have a Samsung S4."
1,"Overall, this a great screen protector. Fits the iphone 6 as advertised, slightly smaller than the screen leaving a 1/8 inch of screen exposed around the edge. The protector I received had some slight defects with the beveled edge, but they are tolerable."
1,Really cute case and nice protection for my phone.
1,"Fits the tablet, well protects well I am very happy with it."
1,"Best bluetooth ever. Clear sound, good range, long-lasting charge."
0,"This item works ok. My main issue with it is that on larger phones such as a Samsung Note, if your phone is in a thicker case, this unit can barely hang on to the phone. I have to finagle it to fit in and stay clamped. If they made the gripping edges about 1/4&#34; longer and slightly bent inwards like this /___\ as opposed to this |___| then it would be so much better and accommodate just about any phone/case combo.<br /><br />Depending on your stereo style, with the way this mounts, it will likely block your stereo's display. Not a fault of the product itself but more like an annoying factor to consider."
1,Very cute and functional.
1,Exactly as described.  The camera hole sets this protector in a class by itself.
1,"It does so much, more than they tell you in the description. Not to mention it's a handsome watch. I look at it quite a bit, and still go a full day without charging. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars was no speaker for wrist phone calls a la James Bond."
-1,This broke instantly after fitting it to my phone. Terrible quality.
-1,can i send it back and get another the phone turn black don't work no more
1,"Love my selfie stick, works perfect"
1,"The first unit I received had been used.  You could tell because there were smudges on the surface and what looked like bits of plastic on the sides.  I contacted Mogix because I was concerned that it had been a returned product and within a day they had shipped me a new one, no charge and even let me keep the first one!  Customer service could not have been nicer and continued to check that I had received my new unit and was satisfied.  After dealing with under-performing customer service reps before, this was a pleasant surprise.  AND I love my Mogix charger.  It works perfectly."
1,Thankyou
0,It works great except the cord didn't hold up. It serves as though it's pulling away from the source. Wires address now exposed. Other then that it works!
1,Very nice to just be able to set my phone on it and begin charging right away! I would buy it again.
1,"Great instructions, easy to install with the alcohol cleaner, dust removal, etc. for two glass screen applications. Thought it's a great product at a great price. Best thing is that the glass doesn't negatively impact the touch sensitivity!"
-1,Bluetooth went bad in 1 month. Wire gone bad in 1 more month.
-1,"This charger does not work!  In fact, it reverses the charge already on the Kindle."
1,Like it jus don't like the closure on the bag.
1,great one i like it
1,Good but its need more speed
0,"Loved the watch when it first came, however, the border for the face fell off just like that without being hit or bumped anywhere during the first week of wear. As a result, currently scared to go around water with it."
1,Awesome
1,good for price
-1,"I ordered three of these, on the theory that Id get at least a couple of good ones.  The gold one, would not pair, no matter what.  the Black one the power switch was not connected to the circuit board, the black and red, worked alright, though if I had phone, and media connected to my Note 4, the answer button, or hangup button, would not work.  Since I mostly used it for listening to music, I felt I could deal with that.  Now, less than 6 months later, the only semi-corking one, has decided that it will no longer charge, and is dead.  Ill order from a reputable vendor, and give al these copies a pass from now on."
1,"Genus design, I love it. Bought one first as a gift, then had to get one for myself. If I could give more than 5 stars I would."
1,"Looks awesome with the gold iPhone!! I love it but the tops not covered, so i got a scuff on my phone."
1,These were perfect for my Galaxy S5 cell phone. Very beautiful with bling on the back. Fits perfect and very attractive. Very reasonably priced too!  I like the protection they give my phone.
-1,"looks cheap, feels that way too."
1,I have always been and Otterbox user for many years. I tried this product when i found it on amazon. this product for me has been stronger than the otterbox. i have dropped this product on numerous occasions and even ran over it with a riding lawnmover. other than minor scratches it was in perfect working order.
1,Good product!
-1,"bad the pouch were you put cards has a pictire window which leaves mark on phone, plastic were you insert phone cracked after a week don't waste your money"
1,Works like expected.
1,Charger doesn't work after 3 weeks.
1,So far I've had it for 5 days and it's still the same!
1,"I was sent this case by anker for a honest and fair review.<br /><br />The case fit the phone impeccably and the button holes and camera perfectly align with the phone. However the case did come into contact with my screen protector but I used some cheap ones off eBay so I don't know if the anker own brand would have been any better.<br />The leather on the case is beyond premium quality, like the title suggests, and is incredibly smooth to touch. The leather itself has a slight padding underneath it.<br />The magnetic clip is strong enough to hold the phone in place but not too strong that you need to wrench it to get it out.<br /><br />Two critiques I do have is:<br />-the flip stand design is not brilliant. Why?, because the dent in the fabric is so small the phone easily moved while in flip position.<br />-the top of the case is entirely exposed, as in the past this is one of the places I have cracked my phone, I would have liked more protection there.<br /><br />This case is of superior quality to any leather case I have ever had and I would recommend the extra couple of quid to protect your beloved phone.<br />I think this case is an exceptional case and a definite buy for anyone interested in a Samsung S6 case."
1,I ordered this item for.my husband and he absolutely loved it...thank you very much.  Works great
1,These cases rock.
1,"I really like the Silicone rubber texture feel<br /><br />- Keep in mind there are multiple sizes for whatever your need may be<br />- 10 inch size is great for some applications and frustrating for others to keep in mind what you will use this for! Works great for Portable Power Chargers and plugging into Computers or USB Hubs that are on your table or desk<br /><br />- Seems to be easier and is more flexible then some cable<br />- MFi Certified, no error messages, charged my iPhone 5S completely even tested flipping the cable back and forth, worked great<br />- Cable is a thicker, hopefully this is for added protection, but also the ends are thicker and may make it difficult or impossible to plug into slim or special cases"
1,you will need this when adding your own motors or needing to integrate with a reversing polarity system.
1,Love it!!!
1,"Great screen protection, very easy to apply. Just make sure you don't touch the sticky side with your fingers might leave a bit of a print. Touch sensitivity goes from 10/10 to 9/10 But nothing thats really bottersome. Screen smoothenes 10/10, and look 9.5/10. Great buy would definitely buy it again! !"
-1,It didn't work with my Samsung Galaxy 3tab!
1,So far this case is sturdy  & battle tested. Phone is completely protected.
1,Great fit and finish.  Charges very well....haven't tested how many charges yet for my iPhone
1,This product is awesome! I've been using FRiEQ with Polar Flow on my iPhone to record my swim workouts the past three weeks. My iPhone has been kept dry and I can check it between laps to check my heart rate and calories burned. Very satisfied!
0,Got it for the husband.  He liked it but was not too impressed.  Provides minimal protection from scratches.
1,"Awesome!!! This product is exactly what I needed. It's easy to apply, and inexpensive to buy. Love it!!!"
0,"I have the Galaxy S6 Edge.  Love my phone and was SO excited to have a wireless charging capability. HOWEVER, when I got this, it worked, what I thought was great. But two nights in a row i used it by my bed and I woke up to a phone only 82% charged.  It sat on the charger for at least 6 hours. Disappointed with this. It's not as fast charging as the cord that came with it.  Still like the idea, but disappointed with overall product"
1,Worked great for iPhone 6 plus. Just not convenient losing the power port when not near a wireless charger.
1,Great
1,Fits and looks good.
1,Love it! It is really easy to open and talk on the phone w/out the lid flipping back closed. Designed really well and would purchase again.
1,Excellent product for the money!  It's very well made and attractive..even came with screen protector!
1,goob seller A+
1,"This is a hard plastic screen protector from arcadia, and bought it fora replacement for the one my wife had on her phone. it comes with 3 sheets in case the first doesn't go well. my advise in installing it is to have the screen free of lint or dust, i took time to clean it very well so i didn't have to repeat the process. happy with my choice"
-1,if you like 17 bubbles this piece of junk is the one you should buy
0,"I was thrilled with this cell phone holder when it first arrived. It feels well made, is well packaged and comes with good instructions for initial setup and use. It's very easy to put you phone in or remove it with one hand. Adjusts to just about any position you need for easy viewing and one handed use. I received it during cool weather however and as summer months with desert heat came on, it began to fail, unable to hold the phone up, finally becoming so loose and floppy as to be useless, forcing me to remove it from my car. I imagine if you live somewhere that doesn't get super hot it the summer if would be great year round. I'm sad it failed because when it worked I absolutely loved it."
1,"Nice 200 watt marine head unit with FM, AM, WB aux in and a USB port. Dose NOT have a CD player and that is okay for me. The weather band is a very handy feature to have, I am surprised that more marine stereos don't come with it. I bought this to replace a Clarion M235 and it sounds way better. I have this radio hooked up to four  5.4&#34; Blaupunkt MSx542 marine speakers and they sound great together."
1,nice and match the space gray colour of my sport watch.......the only is the sharp edge of the bracelet that causes some itchiness and mark on my skin......
1,this phone cover was for my neighbor girl. she likes it. the color is nice. and fits good.
1,I love it!
1,"I have purchased both these and the 6 inch version of the same cable.  I have had no bad cables and no problems with them.  the Magnet and holder help them fit nicely in a laptop bag.  I can grab the black, white, and grey cables and give the kids the colors.  I have them both in my laptop bag and in my car in the Texas heat all day and have had no failures.  I was a bit worried about the open design getting dirty and causing problems but have not experienced that yet.  Seems to be the perfect solution for the need for a bunch of cables around the house to charge various devices."
1,"Better than I thought. The cards DO NOT actually obstruct the screen as it may appear in the picture,  and you can pretty easily fit two cards in the one slot. Only downside is that it takes like 4 weeks to ship... But then it showed up a week early making it three weeks (which is still too long)."
1,"Excellent product, very sturdy and appears that it will not fall apart quickly like others!"
-1,It's not good Quality
1,item as described and arrived on time
-1,Liked it but broke in less than a month
1,Exactly as described. Works great. Can't even tell its on the phone. Very satisfied. Would recommend.
1,yes
0,The only thing that I would have to say about this case is that the wrist band to hold the cell phone broke fairly easily I only had the case for two weeks in the wrist band broke
1,The best Bluetooth on the market
1,It fits my s5 perfect.you do have to take it out of the case to charge it.it is water tight.took it to the beach this weekend and no sand or ocean moisture  got inside the case.
1,Just perfect! I recommend it!!!
0,Cheap wall charger. Car Charger and USB are ok. Wall charger didnt last me a week.
1,"love the color really like product,"
1,Works well.  Item exactly as expected.
1,Very good
1,"Nice quality, worked great,"
1,Lower price and works as it supposed to. I am happy with it.
-1,it did not look like wood at all like the photo it was a bad print as soon as i received it i had to put a sticker over it.
1,"Amazing product!! The magnet is way stronger than it looks, I live in New York where the roads have way too many potholes and this thing holds the phone tight through all the bumps! Love it!"
1,"This was purchased for my husband's phone. He's rough on his phone and I needed a case that will help protect it. He likes the look of this case and it is thinner than the case we had on his phone before. I think I am going to purchase this case for my son's phone as well. The kickstand on the back would be perfect for my son because he likes to watch videos on his phone and this kickstand holds the phone sideways and not straight up like his current case.<br /><br />The 4 stars may be a little premature, but I'm not sure how the phone will hold up when it is dropped on a hard surface like the sidewalk. The other case he had was both hard and rubber and I know that it protected the phones when dropped."
1,Great replacement product!
1,Perfect fit for iPad Mini 2. Good quality.
0,I've had mixed results with this FM transmitter.  It works perfectly with my iPod Nano 1st Gen.  But I can't use the dock (30 pin) connector with my 3rd Gen. iPod Touch without it pausing constantly.  The connector just isn't a good fit for that iPod model--or this particular iPod (though other 30 pin connectors are fine with it).  It DOES work with the iPod Touch if I only connect it via the audio cable.  But the volume is lower that way.<br /><br />The 'transmitter' part of the iClever works pretty well; the signal is often nice and clear.
-1,"Horrible product. While it does pick up local street cameras, it doesn't make a sound when driving by state troopers, which is my main reason for purchasing. I plan on returning"
1,Fits perfect on the phone with the lifeproof nuud case.
1,Worked as it should
1,☺
1,Love it
1,I thought at first the customer service was poor. They were very excellent I just couldnt find out how to get replacement. Quality product service and replaced broken one at no cost to me. Truly a lifetime warranty!!!
1,Excellent item and super fast shipping!
1,I received the screen protector on time and in excellent condition. It was very easy to apply to my screen. Absolutely no problems or complaints from start to finish. Thank you for a great product.
1,very good just don't feel right on the ears.
1,"Awesome slim design.  Slips in and out of my pockets very easily.  I've dropped my phone a few times since I've had this on my phone, once on pavement, and it has protected my phone very nicely."
1,ok
1,It works.
1,"I feel so much better since I started using this product. Specifically I have more energy am generally in higher spirits, and just feel better."
-1,Low quality materials and unsecure for the cellphone.
-1,"Looked great when I got it, but it was difficult to put on the phone. I cracked it once while trying to install it, then it cracked again on the side a few days later. I hadn't dropped it or anything, so I'm not sure why that happened... After about a week of using this case I'm not very happy. Getting a completely different case to replace this one ASAP. Bummer."
1,I love my selfie stick. We have tons of fun with it. It is super easy to use.
1,"Works as described.  Holds phone securely, but still easy to get out when needed."
-1,Sent it bsck
1,"this came perfect and it works overseas, i am in the uk and ordered it from the us and it works perfectly with a gsm carrier, must be one luckily i have that i would buy again if needed"
1,Love it.
0,"It's okay, got where tired and shredded fast."
-1,It broke within the first 30 days.
1,"MAN! I LOVE my Pachyderm!<br /><br />I've charged my iPhone twice today (it reached about 20% one of the times, and 30% range the other). Hooked it up to my Pachyderm charged it right up (and fast too! Just about 30mins).  The Pachyderm battery, after using it twice is at 75% charge left. That's incredible!!<br /><br />Highly recommend getting this! It's thin, light-weight, sleek appearance.  You can slip it in a purse, or pack it on a trip! Now I don't have to worry if my hotel room has enough plugs for my iPhone and Laptop!"
1,Love the bumpers and the color choices. The back is clear with the color along the sides of the phone. I hate bulky cases and a bumper is the perfect choice for me.
1,Shipping was crazy fast. Product is exactly as described. Worth every penny. I'll definitely be shopping here again
1,"Simple wall charger with fold-out prongs. The build quality seems excellent and my Verizon LG G3 hasn't complained about it one bit. Charging speed may be a little faster. Stays much, much cooler than my old charger."
1,Good quality and nice finish. Though its little bit heave for its material but good to have such a product. Kids will love to play with it.
-1,"I only bought this Samsung phone case to see if I would like it better over the Samsung Galaxy Ace Style S765C Stardust s766c Case Wydan (TM) Hybrid Studded Diamond Rhinestone Case but I did not, so I returned it. The color's on the case I loved but, did not keep it long enough to really try it out."
-1,"Charged did turbo, but it takes about 8 hours. Not a turbo charger"
0,Case is sturdy. My case started turning grey after a few times of being in my pocket.
1,"This case has far exceed my expectations. Not only does the case give my phone a classy look, but it also protects my phone very well. The case it two-fold; the first comes is a soft rubber like material that covers the entire phone, then you finish it off by enclosing it with the bottom and top part that come together. Surprisingly durable and complete access to all ports."
0,I rated this phone cover with a 3 because the color is not the same.
1,works as it is supposed to
1,"This is a great product for the value.  Installation was very easy.  You will probably need to purchase a long A/V cable to reach from end of the vehicle to the other.  Camera works great, even at night.  I installed mine in my Ford F150 to make backing to trailers easier.  I wish I had installed this a long time ago."
1,i got the bluetooth earphone thank's.
1,"Yes, it did meet my expectations."
1,This unit was everything i expected plus alittle more.
0,"issues because of the curved screen, I hope they make a hard glass version with the edge curves soon"
1,Excellent
0,"REALLY hard to put on and take off, I broke the front trying to take it off the first time and had to superglue it back together"
1,Excellent
1,crystal clear.  much better than the flimsy peel off protectors.
1,"Light, thin yet a durable case. I bought the teal one but the color is not as bright as it in the picture :( but I still love the case. Thinking of getting it in different colors. :)"
0,very big and bulky.
-1,I bought 2  a couple weeks ago. Already 1 is causing my iPhone 6 to reject it as uncertified. The other is okay so far.<br /><br /> Also I wish the light was only on when charging instead of always when plugged in. I have a different make of lighted cable that's only lighted when plugged into a device.
-1,spot where cards go ripped after 2 weeks.
1,"It worth the price. I think it's nice smartphone. I strongly recommen it. But the battery life is short, just charge it regularly"
-1,Had the screenprotector for less than day and already cracked with barely hitting it.  I do not recommend this product whatsoever!!!
1,Great product - real leather - you can tell a difference!
-1,Too bulky and sticks out too far from the vent.  I like the cradle design.  I just don't like the bulkiness of it.
-1,The arm doesn't articulate very well in relationship to the handle that opens the clip.
0,The first two I bought for my grandkids worked great. The last one I bought says Google Play is not compatible with this device and I can't load the games I bought for them on it.  The other two worked fine with Google Play and I have 40 or 50 games on them for various age levels. The last one I received did not come in the manufacturers Contixo box as the other two I purchased did so I'm not sure if it was a refurbished one or not. It was supposed to be new but came in a plain white box. I had planned on buying one more for my grandkids but now I'm hesitant to purchase anymore.
-1,Definitely does NOT fit the ballistic nylon phone... Cannot even use the side buttons because they do not line up properly. Wish it actually fit my phone though. Depressing and false advertising. Will change rating when I hear why you lied and said it actually fits my phone. -Droid Turbo Ballistic Nylon
1,"exactly what i was looking for, not too bulky, good protection.  fits my needs at a great price!!"
-1,We returned this item right away because the phone was cracked and did not meet our needs.
1,"Good Product if you are just looking for depth and water temp, I was . It does work for fishing but I think a die-hard fisher would want one of the bigger models. Easy install."
1,fit my phone perfectly.  fast shipping and great price
-1,I have had this case for less than a month and I dropped it and the case cracked and chipped! I am going to try to return it. But I don't know if I can
1,Nice quality and comfort.?The link removal tool worked perfectly and I had it adjusted in minutes.
1,it's great
1,Great product.
1,Works pretty well.
1,Recommended ...
1,This is a nice holder.  I use it for my cell phone and GPS.  The only downside is that sometimes it swivels while I'm driving.
1,It seems to work as well as the Apple cable but much more economical.
1,"Charges device(s) quickly and efficiently, would buy again."
1,Works with nook color but an expensive cord without the plug adaptor
-1,It didn't work well with my OnePlus One.
1,Very strong simple design at appropriate price. Paired with a dashboard mount from another company; very sturdy.
-1,"I wouldn't give one star, it's nothing what the pictures show, it's ugly and not the teal color and looks like a screen print glued to a cheap piece if sh*t case and there is no shine to it and no glittery anchor like the picture shows. Totally disappointed with this purchase, I thought I  was getting a deal, I can't give this case away, it's terrible. Back to the bulky but reliable otterbox. The picture I took does no justice, it's dull, no glitter and definitely not teal, more baby blue! :( And it is broken, the side by the power key is broken."
-1,I've used this maybe 10 times and it's started giving me problems!
1,Works great. Can't beat the price.
-1,sounds horrible
1,This is the best phone case I have ever had.  I am a very clumsy person. I would say I drop my phone on average at least 4 times per week. I have dropped my phone where it has actually bounced off the side of a table and then hit the floor and my phone still worked. I have also dropped my phone in a puddle of water and my phone was fine. While I don't suggest trying this at home I would suggest this for any other clumsy person out there. For this price you can't go wrong and it's not bulky like some others out there.
1,"The pens are wonderful,i really like the colors and the s smooth way they write"
-1,"fall off everytime ,not a good product"
0,ok
1,Fits the phone perfectly even with the leather back and does not add much bulk to the phone. Best feature for me is the built in screen saver. One improvement would be to make it possible to use the clip with the phone facing out.
0,Pattern on the outside does not wear well.
1,OE and works as intended.
-1,This case is extremely thick and difficult to put on and remove. Makes the side buttons almost useless. I regret purchasing this case.
-1,"Awsome case while it lasted, to bad it was only 2 weeks."
1,So happy to have a charger for my car! It works great with my 5C and iPad.
-1,Just ok.  I bought a few & 1 broke so it doesn't hold the cell phone in place.  The other one takes rapid fire pictures when it feels like it off & on.
1,Great Backup.
1,No
1,"This, like everything else I have tried from Anker, works exactly as advertised!"
1,I have no problems excellent product same charging speed as the white 3.0 charger +100
-1,It doesn't  protect you phone it cheap and unsafe could break easy don't by this piece of plastic
-1,Earphones dnt work  very well
1,"I bought this for my boat. So cool. The power never stops when I unug my shore power it automatically switches to inverter. It powers my fridge, a/c & TV no problems. Highly recommended."
-1,"This case is a piece of garbage.  My daughter received it for her birthday to &#34;protect&#34; her new iphone 6.  The second time she went in the pool with the phone and the case, the phone suffered water damage and was rendered useless.  Now we own a worthless $70 case for a $600 broken phone.  These cases are a complete sham."
-1,Holster was too big for iPhone 6.
1,good ! my best
-1,The Case broke in 10 days
1,This Garmin GPS has worked very well so far.  The rechargeable battery is a big plus.
-1,Did not install well twice. Had to purchase a different brand.
1,Good
1,"I love wooden cases and this is exactly what I look for. The only thing I would suggest improving is the fitting, maybe a small hook at the lower corners would improve."
1,Fast shipping. Fit perfectly.  Very satisfied!
1,"Works great on Miata, Acura RDX, and PT Cruiser, with various versions of iPhones.  I use it ever day and it's showing no sign of falling apart."
0,"Didn't use it that long because it is really bulky, and makes a lot of things difficult to use on your phone.. So I just took it off."
-1,These thing break within a month of usage.
-1,"Previous versions are better. Look like Jawbone are not interesting to continue developing headset and they prefer go with the activity tracker, very disappointment"
1,Wife loves it.  Works great!
-1,"It was too big for my Sony Walkman to fit in it, item didn't match description"
-1,yuk
-1,"Was expecting a case for the Galaxy S6 Edge, but received a case for the iPhone 6. The barcode on the packaging was a barcode for the S6 Edge stuck on top of an iPhone 6 barcode."
1,Great protector.  Fit as advertised.  Customer service checked in to make sure I was very satisfied.  I am.
1,Fits perfectly
1,Love it
1,Amazing phone & for the price that I got it for (69.99) I surely cannot complain. Love it....Thanks PCS Wireless...
1,As promised
1,"Easy to put on, doing a great job of protecting my phone and making the screen easy to clean off fingerprints.."
0,"This case is okay. It did protect my phone from multiple drops. I think the edge is raised just enough so that when you drop your phone face down, it doesn't land on the glass.  It is a very low-profile, slip case, easy to slip in and out of your pocket or purse, and allows the beauty of your phone to shine through.  That being said, the case really isn't very durable or long lasting.  I've been using it for a little over 3 months now and the pink rubbery edge has separated from the clear plastic and really this case is about to fall apart.  However, at a low price point, the case suited my needs for a while and I don't mind that it's time to buy a new one.  You get what you pay for, right?"
-1,ENVIARON UN CASE DIFERENTE AL MODELO SOLICITADO.
-1,Very easy to get dirty. Not sturdy. Don't recommend.
0,there very fun but they do not fit the fitbit as well as the original band but with that said it has latch keepers so it will not catch and fall off like the original fit bit band
-1,"Got it today, its going back tomorrow, its that bad. This is something you would find at the thrift dollar store only nobody would buy it for even a buck so it would be on clearence for .50 cents! It is that cheap feeling. The fabric is probably the cheapest stuff ever produced and the &#34;bean balls&#34; inside are so light that they dont hold the phone worth a crap. This has to be the worst product ive ever purchased on amazon. DO NOT BELIEVE ANY REVIEW HIGHER THAN 2 STARS, because nobody in their right mind would think this is a good product for more than $1 at the dollar store."
-1,Headphones did not work. Tried to pair them wirh Panasonic home phones bought at the same time without success. Directions are poorly written. No online help. Wish there were a zero rating
1,"This came packaged perfectly and it was exactly what I wanted. It fit the phone perfectly and, looked wonderful."
1,Great product! Charges quickly and for someone like me who is always in a hurry and always on the go Who doesn't have a lot of time to wait or waste.  And I lose a lot of chargers and cords.  Sometimes they grow legs and disappear.  I will Buy this product again in the near future.
1,bought well over a year ago (maybe it's been 2) and it's still working fine!
1,"The Xperia Z3 Compact is a flagship level Android smartphone. Build materials are top-notch, and the device is visually elegant. Applications operate with virtually no lag. The camera performs well, although I would have preferred optical image stabilization over digital image stabilization. The battery lasts for about 2 days with WiFi and Bluetooth turned on, and I have managed to go 3 days without charging on some occasions. I use the Sony magnetic charging dock to avoid having to open the micro-usb port cover every time I charge the phone.<br /><br />The first Z3C that I received was a Central American model which unfortunately was defective since the nano-sim slot cover would not stay closed. The second Z3C that I received was a European model. It has been functioning well for 2 months now."
1,thanks
1,Arrived ahead of schedule (which was a big plus) and the product was exactly as advertised.
1,Received product and it was exactly as described. The charger is well made and very easy to use. I am very pleased with my purchase. This is one of my 3 Ravpower products. I have never been disappointed with how well they work.
1,"Works great, nice not having a bunch of stuff plugged in."
-1,Had this armband for less than two months and the right seam split apart the whole way and my ipod fell out while I was cutting grass. Would like manufacturer feedback on replacement.
1,"Fits very well, doesn't block any of my phones components."
-1,poor quality.Never buy it again!
1,I'm in love with this case
-1,"Yup, I should have taken the other low star reviews seriously.<br />I have never put on 1-star before, but this is the worst product I've purchased through Amazon.<br />This headphone, after working for about two weeks, would not work on the LEFT ear bud.<br />I really like the fact that the battery lasts over two days of on-off usage - so I won't complain about the Amazon not having the option of &#34;0&#34; star.<br />$27.99 and my time to write this warning review just went down the drain."
1,"Love this, holds everything required. Only way to improve,  would be to add belt chip!!"
1,Exactly what I needed for long days and nights out of the office!
1,"Black is always my first choice. After buy this headphones i was so excited to get a black headphones, as well as it was my first buy in amazon. Now i am using this super quality headphones which has many nice features. I like their sound system, specially for crystal clear sound,never cut out during listen to song. It fits to my ear comfortably. Battery life much better than other headphones. Happy to get this headphones."
-1,Stopped working after two weeks very disatified
1,"Although I ordered the wrong phone (this is GSM but I found out later that I really I needed CDMA 450 MHz)<br />but nevertheless, I love the phone. The volume is enhanced, so that if you are hard of hearing this perfect. I gave it away to a friend who lives in a rural town in Yucatan, Mexico, actually it is for his elderly mom, who finds in hard to operate a small handheld cell phone. This is a fixed wireless desk phone that works great with a SIM card from the Mexican cell phone company TELCEL."
1,Easily fit in Galaxy Note 3. Performed just as well as Samsung's. Excellent value.
1,Fits good. Not perfect but good.
1,works as promised
-1,not what I thought it would be
1,"S pen works accurately, battery last for well over 24 hours and that is with listening get to Pandora and tunein radio for 10 hours. Graphics are crisp and clear. Camera works well. If I needed a phone, I would buy this again."
1,"I received the charger very fast, and am pleased with the contact the seller has made to ensure I'm happy with my order. They seem eager to please, but I doubt I'll have to contact them, because I'm happy with my charger.  I like that it is slightly illuminated, so I can easily find it in the dark.  Note:  I believe the port labelled &#34;iPad&#34; has more amps, which is necessary to charge an iPad, but you can also use it to speed charge your phone if you have a quality cable."
1,"very good for the price, quick delivery"
1,Securely holds my phone (Galaxy S6 Active w/ a case) and the suction cup is amazingly strong.  To the point where I have a hard time getting it off the window when I want to move it to a different car.  I was completely unable to remove it until I found the tab in the back and even then it was not easy.<br /><br />The one complaint I have is that the tab to remove it is tucked away underneath an overhanging piece of plastic (see the product photo) so it's hard to get a good grip on it.
1,Great product and they have an awesome warranty for it in case any issues ever come up
0,"The protector does do a good job at protecting the screen, but I'm not overly happy with it's ability to adhere to the screen well."
-1,"All three worked well for the first week, but two stopped connecting."
1,This case is sturdy yet sleek and not bulky. It is not slippery to hold due to a slightly rubberized texture. I'm a pink lover but it comes in many color- masculine and feminine.  The gorilla glass has a tutorial to show how to apply it properly. It's better than a plastic film- it looks like the actual screen and is perfectly responsive to touch. Good value too! Well pleased!!!
1,"I received a promo code to give a fair review of this product. The case is fairly strong, and it does protect my phone without adding bulkiness. Overall I am pleased with this protection case. I would recommend this item."
1,excellent product!
1,Good phone
1,I have bought many screen protectors in the past. This is the best one I have ever installed on my phone.
1,Great product. Been useful for my month of traveling. Would definitely consider getting another one
1,"It took a little while to get here, but it's super cute! I love it. I hate carrying around big purses, so this is perfect since I don't carry around a lot of things. I definitely recommend"
1,Good. Very compact nd atttrctive.
-1,"Realized after I bought this that it was for an android phone, stupid me. So I gave it to a friend and he told me the lighted cord only lasted for a week...maybe a fluke?"
-1,"I'm very disappointed in this. The case seems sturdy enough, and fits my iPad Air 2 very nicely, but I can't make my iPad stand no matter what I do. It just slides and lays down flat. The white color is more an off white, not particularly nice. The graphic on it (dandelion) is pretty lousy. It's somewhat distorted and not clear, a dull black. Seems like a cheap job of putting it on the case, like maybe it was stretched too much to make it fit. At least it was cheap."
1,"This speak is loud enough, even louder than I expected. So far it's working well. I am able to bring this speaker everywhere. Since the week I got this speaker, I wasn't needed to charge it for a week (got this last week). I like it so much."
1,I am pleased with the product and the view that it gives. I would have given it a five star rating if the information that came with the kit dealing with installation and operation was more complete. Although tech support was right on.
-1,"Good afternoon the products have not reached this far, although I have written have not answered"
1,"This is a little bulkier than I would like but I like that it has a replaceable battery. I put this on my Son's iPod case since he keeps misplacing it and it has helped us not leave it in restaurants and find out if it is still in the car or his room. I have used the sound emitter from the app several times. The distance tracking is not that accurate, but the play sound ability makes up for that."
-1,Had to return after a month.  They didn't work.  Also didn't hold a charge.
0,"not what i was expecting, but its cute, it fits perfectly, doesn't block any ports or anything"
1,"Worth the price, high-end radios."
1,Worked very well
1,"I am a regular shopper of Amazon, and never leave reviews.  But this is worth a review since it has none prior to mine.  I ordered two other cases before this one, and they weren't to the level of this one.  The phone case fits very nice around the phone and has a soft leather feel to the back.  It has strong magnets that keeps it in place in the wallet, but still makes it easy to remove when you want to use just the phone for pics etc. without having the bulk of the wallet.  This was what I was looking for in a case the most...a wallet that still allowed for the phone to be easily removed if needed.  The card holder having 9 slots and snaping together so that your personal info isn't viewable when you are using or checking your phone is wonderful and surprisingly hard to find in other cases.  Having the card slot designed this way also prevents the cards from scratching your screen.  The only thing I would change about the case would be to make the strap that holds the entire case together a snap instead of a magnet.  I haven't had any issues with the magnet, but it would feel more secure if it was a snap.  I would recommend this case to anyone that has the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus."
1,"Working great with my iPad Air 2. No issues, charges quickly and does not give any errors. Will purchase more in the future, definitely work every penny."
1,Great case! No complaints!
1,"Love it! It covers my phone and protects it very well. Plus, it's very cute."
-1,It messed up my photos they came out looking like a big white ball
0,"Pretty good, however the quote parts glue gave out about 2 months of having it."
1,This charger is awsome
1,good
-1,"Terrible quality pieces of garbage is what these are. Stay away from this screen. Ordered one, did install, screen faintly lights up black, no color, no picture, no usability. Tested the flex cables coming from the screen, they connect fine, and appear to be in overall good shape, more than likely the pins on the lcd cable do not line up properly with the pins on the actual phone...per usual hong kong handmade style. At this time though, unknown cause of  the issue. Took off and ordered a replacement from the seller. Second one arrives after several days of waiting. It should have been sent with the original two day shipping, but instead they sent it at their own pace. Did the install, and voila! Same exact issue. not a difference at all. Clearly these screens are pure garbage, they are not tested, and they do not work. The price of this product might make people think it is of quality, but it is truly a rip off......Buyer beware...."
-1,"Does not work well if your CD slot has a curved face. Many factory CD players have a curved face and this mount does not stay securely in place because the nGroove blade has a straight edge, so the outer parts of the blade don't fully insert into the drive. Other reviewers indicated this still works on a curved slot, but it fails miserably in my car. Stays in place for about 20 minutes and then wobbles and pops out. Sending this one back for refund unfortunately."
-1,"It doesn't work; , returning it"
-1,The edges peel up. Tried to reapply multiple times. The fit is really bad. Buy a name brand and save the frustration.
-1,It worked for 3 weeks it the second one first one did not work at all
1,GRRRRRRRREAT
-1,"the the diamond look (bling) part that traces around the case,came off on day 2. the 2 pieces of stone that is on the closure came off as well. it was not worth the money. if I should you all a picture of this case and I haven't had it a month you wouldn't believe how quickly it fell apart..very disappointed"
0,"Case is ok. Good build, but the silver looks a LOT brighter on the Amazon photos. In reality, the color is very dull/boring/gray-ish. I was expecting more of a bright silver finish."
1,great for what they are. often misplace my stylus. now I can have several on hand.
1,Nice product
-1,"Can't beat the price, but this product broke within three days of purchase. But I don't feel bad since the price was cheap."
1,Good headphones for the price.  Great Value.
1,"I loved this particular case for the way it fit and the fact it actually feel like a case, not a piece of rubber I found in previously owned ones."
1,A year later and it's still going strong!
1,Awesome product
1,Great case. Very protective but not too bulky. IR blaster works great with this case too. I've dropped my phone a few times (on concrete too) and not a scratch to my phone.
1,Good phone protection. easy to clip on a belt. maybe a little too much velcro but that's an easy duct tape fix. just cover some of the area with a small patch.
1,Received in a timely manner in condition described. Happy with the quality of the product. Haven't stopped using it yet! Love this thing.
-1,I love the idea of the case but mine and my husbands broke within a week the plastic by the power button cracked and now the door wont stay closed
1,working perfect
1,"Perfect fit for my Bose unit, the handle makes it easier to carry without dropping it."
1,Excellent case!!!  Very cute and functional!
-1,Arrived with corner of glass cracked. Wet wipes included in kit did not do the job in getting phone clean. Worst screen protector I've purchased thus far.
-1,fair does not fit the iphone 5 properly.
1,Works good on my iPhone 5 S...you must clean the screen first before applying or else it won't do you any good. I would buy it again...
1,These are really good for the price. Cannot complain.
1,received as pictured
1,very good protection. fit very tight. makes swiping from the sides a bit difficult and the power button becomes incredibly sensitive.
0,"The cords are nice and long, but the charge is pretty slow and some of the times I can't even get them to start charging! I have to mess around with them a lot."
0,I guess its my fault for breaking it but the connection could have been more reliable leading up to that
1,"My 10 yr old loves this cell phone cover.  It is stylish, and I am pleased at how well it protects her phone."
1,"I don't usually write reviews, but this is really cute. I love the colors and the stylus was a nice surprise. Fast shipping and the price is really great."
1,"Delivery was early, so that was great! Protector goes on very easy, no bubbles whatsoever. Protect doesn't go all the way to the sides, but that's to be expected. I dealt with the same thing with every protector for my iPhone 6 plus. So that wasn't a deal breaker for me. Cut outs our dead on, so no problems there. But smudges!!!!!!! Smudges are ridiculous! Even with clean clean fingers the oil Smudges are pretty bad. For the privacy part. It does a very good job. If it wasn't for the smudge issue, I would have given this protector 5 stars. But I'm OCD and it bothers me."
1,"Great strong case , and glass works great . I have chipped the glass protector on my phone from dropping it on rocks"
1,"Great price nice case fast shipping, I'm happy with my case."
-1,Feels nice and slim. Really adds no bulk but the case started peeling off on the back. After about 2 weeks. Not happy. Especially since the color really complimented the original gold of the iPhone 6
1,difficult to see in the sun and/or in bright light.
1,Does exactly what it's supposed to
-1,Cable shorted out after using only a month
1,Awesome
0,ok
1,Love it so far! Had an IPhone before. Like this better so far. The price I awesome!
1,LOVE this case!!!
-1,It doesn't let my phone receive good signal.
1,"So far, working great! I didn't want to spend a lot on a charger...and I didn't have to!"
-1,"Garbage. That's the only word that comes to mind.  The plastic feels like garbage, the thin rubber surround feels like garbage, it's just garbage."
-1,"easy to install and feels like it will work. unfortunately that was not the case for me. I have the tempered glass screen protector in combination with a hybrid case that has a built in plastic screen protector. I dropped my phone from my locker (maybe 2 feet from the ground) and noticed a crack. crossed my fingers that it was the screen protector doing its job and not my phone screen that broke, but it didn't look to be that way. turns out my screen cracked and the protector did not. 1 star for this. ordered a new one from another company."
1,Is well built and was able to charge my MS Surface 3 which no other power supply (other than the original) has been able to do.
1,Works great!
1,This was cute but I returned it because it was not what I thought it was. The item was okay with no problems but I cannot say more than that because I did not use it.
1,"This is a great product. I was nervous about wearing my 42mm Stainless Steel Apple Watch out when working in the yard or when working out as I didn't want the stainless steel to scratch. I'm not so worried about the face as it's sapphire on my model. For years I've used a similar style of rubber case on my iOS devices to protect the case. This product filled the need for me with the Apple Watch. The product is 100% soft rubber so there's no risk of any device scratching from the inside. When installed on the Apple Watch it does not increase the thickness of the case. Additionally the colors add the ability to mix and match the styles as needed. This was exactly what I needed.<br /><br />The only con of this product is getting it on the Apple Watch is tricky. You need to remove at least one side of the band to make it easy because the bands actually slip through the case. I've seen other products (not tested) that slip on the sides making installation faster an easier. I would imagine that those are also easier to fall off accidentally.<br /><br />I'm not using this all the time but when doing activities where my watch may come into contact with something hard accidentally I'm throwing this on for protection.<br /><br />I purchased this product from Amazon and have not received and compensation, free product or other benefit from the manufacturer or Amazon for my review. The product tested was NOT a free sample from the manufacturer and the opinions stated above are solely mine based on my interaction with the product."
-1,This item worked great...once!  When I used it again (after the return period had expired)...it would no longer hold a charge...or is not fully recharging even though the lights indicate it is has completed charging.  Garbage!!!
1,"Great cable! Sturdy and secure, The color is black so it doesn't blend in with all my other white cables and being so long, I can use my device and charge it at the same time. Thick wire doesn't get tangles at all and easy to wind up."
1,So far so good. Working as intended. Charges fast. Carry this on my backpack and constantly using it at school and at work without a single issue so far.
-1,After about a week of having it my wife showed be that it started to rip where it bends. The case looked nice till this happened. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Eyes and mouth scratch off.
1,GOOD
1,Rapid charger! Charges very quickly which is what I need!
1,"This selfie stick is SO much more than a selfie stick. I was offered a free product in exchange for an honest review. Having used other selfie sticks before, I was expecting to rate this one lower. Why? I'd had MANY other experiences to compare this one to. Could it -really- be the BEST one I'd tried? Well, yes- it definitely could be. I am so impressed with this dang thing that it's not even funny. Can you hear the excitement in my voice? It's definitely there. Anyways- why is it a 5 star product?<br /><br />This is an all-in-one selfie stick. Essentially it's not only a selfie-stick, it's also a tripod. Let's discuss the selfie-stick aspect first. As with most selfie-sticks, you connect your phone (or this one can actually work with a GoPro camera as well) to the stick, and then you take a picture. This one has a bluetooth button that you can connect to your phone- then you press the button and it takes the picture. You can get all sorts of awesome angles holding the phone a ton of different positions. LOVE it! I just have so much fun with it.<br /><br />But, the real reason this selfie-stick sticks out from the rest is that it can also be used as a tripod. It has three feet on the end that can be spread out, and then the stick can be adjusted to different heights. Once again you can connect your phone or GoPro to the stand, and then use your bluetooth button to take a picture. This makes it PERFECT for taking large group selfies. You can literally stand the camera up at an appropriate height, run into the picture with your group, snap you clicker and take a photo! It's so unique in the fact that you no longer need a photographer behind the camera. You can take pictures at a distance and that's really awesome to me.<br /><br />I like that the tripod can be adjusted in height so you can take an array of different photos and make sure that everyone fits in (whether their shorter kiddos or taller adults). The tripod itself is a bit wobbly, but it gets the job done. The clicker works well, but loses it's connection at about 15 feet away (but seriously who's taking a picture that far away anyways?). Overall, and awesome product. I'm rating it five stars because it's so versatile, and I'm definitely a fan.he clicker works well, but loses it's connection at about 15 feet away (but seriously who's taking a picture that far away anyways?).

1,"1 inlet port and 2 outlet ports keep this 11200mAh Portable Charger External Battery Power Bank simple and easy to use. Included in the package is a USB charging cord. This device has 2 ports to charge your phone, tablet, or other devices. 1 Port is rated at 1 amp and the second port is rated at 2 amps of charging capacity. This Charge Pack has a lot of muscle when you need it most. Fully charged this power bank should charge a iPhone 6 four to five times. Priced right and simple to use, get one today and stay connected.<br /><br />Disclaimer: this item was purchased at a discounted price for reviewing purposes."
1,Great case! It is sturdy. It has a nice design. I've dropped my phone several times and the case only has a few minor scratches but at least none are on the phone. I will definitely be buying cases from this company from now on.
1,"This cover was for my mothers phone, we loved it...  :)"
1,"I've had this case for more than 6 months, no scratches so far even after multiple drops."
-1,Screen arrived shattered and unusable. Could not use. Missing tools.
1,good
1,Good Protection
1,"I receive so many compliments and wonder that I am going to purchase another in another color.  It does make the phone slightly heavier, but well worth it."
-1,The part where IDs was okay but there was no room for money how to put a small change purse in there very tight not what I expected.
1,"I bought this so I could simultaneously charge my Android phone, my wife's Iphone, and supply power to a car Dash cam.<br /><br />Because of the power draw of the three devices, as well as the length of wire needed to reach the dash cam, I really wanted to be certain that any three or four port charger was going to deliver high amperage and consistent to spec voltage to every device.  This works perfectly for my three devices, and I'm confident that I could even charge a fourth demanding device on the spare usb port!<br /><br />The build quality is reasonable for the price.  The device doesn't have an internal fuse, which may or may not give you pause; I would have liked to have a fuse on it preferably of a lower amperage than the fuse in my car's fuse box, but many prefer chargers without.  The reasoning I've heard for not having a fuse is that there is one less piece to break or lose if you continuously plug and unplug the charger.  That isn't my use case, but I respect that judgement.  Since it is a toss up as to whether this detracts from the device quality, depending on the tastes of the user, I can't deduct stars for it.<br /><br />It fits snug in the two 12v power points within front armrest and rear passenger cabin in a 2014 Chevy Volt, and is very awkward to use in the top of dash cubby 12v power point.<br /><br />Since I live in central Texas (aka 102 F summer weather,) I want to especially note that this device doesn't run noticeably hot, even when burdened with full charging loads from 3 2 Amp devices.  Every additional input of heat into the cabin of my car can make a difference, so I'm glad when something doesn't burn with the fury of a tiny 12v powered sun."
1,"A great portable charger. Small powerful, charges apple and android."
1,They work as stated I've not had any problems .
1,"very nice, love the colors, just wishing there were more choices for those of us, who own droids; not everyone has an I-phone!"
1,Fast shipping and a great price.  This is a bargain if you re not into texting and constant phone use.  I have triple minutes phone so this gives me 1200 minutes .  Which is usually plenty for me.
1,"It works very well.  It was a replacement for another model.  Unlike that one, this one continues to work."
1,Great cord.
1,Excellent travel adapter.  Works very well in Europe.
-1,it didn't fit the Tab 3 7&#34;<br />that I got
-1,"Pure crap.  ive spent literally hundreds on zagg screen protectors over the past several years.  And I've largely been satisfied. But when it comes to the glass for iPhone 6 I'm on my third protector in less than a year.  The edges seem to chip almost immediately upon install.  I even had the last two &#34;professionally&#34; installed but it made no difference .  Yes, zagg warrants their products but frankly dealing with warranty claims is a hassle.  At this point I've got a hundred bucks in protectors for this one phone alone.  All in a span of about seven months.  I will probably file a warranty claim this time and when the fourth one fails (and it will) I'll try another brand.  I'm not going back to a poly protector after experiencing glass.  But I'm not going to keep putting these crappy zagg ones on either..."
1,easy to install.  check to be sure your cord will work with this inplace.  some won't
1,feels good when running but i feel like sooner or later it will rip.
1,Awesome to not worry about my phone going dead for 4 days!
0,"At 10 feet, I can plug my tablet or phone in at the charging station in front of my tv and sit on the couch and play clash of clans. It charged up my Samsung tablet albeit slowly, it still kept the tablet charged up while in use. This was by no means a lightning fast charge, but I was in no rush either. A cable this long requires a clip or twist tie to keep it neat and organized when not in use. Because of its rope like material, it does not kink easily like the traditional silicone/plastic style cables. But it can if pressed, squeezed, or pinched. If you have a family van, this works great if you don’t have access to a charging port in the middle of back of the vehicle. Now we don’t have to sit right next to the outlet to charge our gadgets.<br /><br />These come in bright colors so there’s no mistaking or stealing of cords in the same house.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for my honest review.<br /><br />UPDATE: 9/13/15<br />I recently noticed that for some electronics it did not charge at all. I had a small battery pack plugged in overnight to charge and when I remembered to grab my battery, it was not charged at all. But for all other items I use it for, it works well."
1,"Perfect for what I needed to go kayaking and sailing. Fits my big Note 4 perfectly and yes you can take pictures, video and use the phone inside the bag (turn off fingerprint authentications though since that won't go through the plastic). I would pair it with a floating key fob to make sure it doesn't sink."
1,I love this case.  I followed the instructions and tested the case prior to using.  It's great for stand-up paddle boarding and I appreciate all the color options!
1,Well constructed cell phone mount with optional ways to use it. Fast delivery by the company. I love it.
1,we have had someone messing around our back yard. so we got this camera to find out who it was. and it worked perfect. the first night we caught them. they are now in jail.
-1,These do not work and I have received two separate orders. I consider myself a responsible consumer. I read reviews and do research before buying. The information here said that these were reliable and if there were any problems I could return them. Well this is set number two that does not work and I don't have time to keep returning these.
1,very nice case.
0,cheap....
-1,"It works, but It doesn't fit with a case. I used it for 2 days maybe."
1,"Great phone case and feels nice to hold, love it, worth it."
1,OK
1,Exactly what I wanted
1,I am very pleased with this case although it got dirty fast it's a cute case I would totally recommend this case it fits my iPhone 6 perfectly 👌🏼👌🏼 AMAZING CASE!!
1,works great
-1,The bottom hatch broke the very first day I got it. Makes pictures cloudy as well.
0,Its thick screen protector
-1,"Wrong unit for my machine, even thou I was informed it would work.<br /><br />Just tossed it"
1,[[VIDEOID:1777300240a889680a90b3b900285cb4]]
1,Perfect 4 my phone
1,It was very long....!
1,Everything was good.
1,"Have had no issue with this and it has definitely outlasted any of the Apple cables. Keep it at home, throw it in my backpack, travel with it. It's good quality, but I know there was one or two off times when I got a &#34;not a certified apple product&#34; warning on my phone when I plugged it in (but usually that was resolved by unplugging and plugging it back in)."
1,Wonderful pens. They have fiber tips and the price was excellent.  I would highly recommend this product.
1,"This is only the 2nd selfie stick I've ever used and this one is way better quality then the first one I tried. The first one was bought at Rue 21 for $5 and didn't have anything that connects to your phone so you had to set a timer to take a picture and the part that is supposed to hold the phone didn't even hold it so it usually fell out before the picture was even taken. With the Kiwii Selfie Stick, the part that is supposed to hold the phone actually holds it in place. It also has a cord that plugs into your headphone jack that allows you to take a picture by pressing the button at the bottom of the stick. I had planned on giving this selfie stick to my nieces as a gift but after using it a few times I think I'm going to keep it and just by them a different one! The picture below shows what was in the box when I received it.<br /><br />I received this selfie stick free for review purposes but all opinions are my own honest and unbiased thoughts on the product."
1,I love that this does not coil. Its easier to put away and doesn't spring you phone onto the floor.
1,Great product at a Great price.
1,It was just what I wanted they fit perfectly the quality also was great
1,A+
1,Easier to use the phone. Charging time seems longer. Needed this cord.
-1,"It fits nice, but the case does not stay together I don't even use it anymore."
1,"Great case especially for this price. Soft case with a hard case feel. Case extends around bezek to protect the front, keeps the phone nice and slim, clear so you can still show off the sthle of the phone. No complaints from me"
-1,It has never worked.!!!
-1,"the cables look like USB 3.0, but they aren't. I connected my cell phone to my Computer and didn't get the Use USB 3 message."
-1,Cords worked for a week then started displaying the message that they weren't compatible with the device.
1,Love it thanks
1,"So far, so good. Works as advertised, great price."
0,Love the design and the case but it's not flexible at all so it broke when I took it off once
1,"Good coverage, great color, not too thin or thick, fits in & out of belt pouch with ease! Color is true to pic!"
-1,strap came off but not before the magnet stopped working.<br />Another thing that will have to go in the trash and I'll have to replace it.
1,"Case fits well. Does not add too much in the way of size but still provides adequate protection. Case easy to handle, no slip."
-1,"This is the worst SHEILD, I have ever purchase. It's has air bubbles all he way around it."
1,I go through a lot of screen protectors. A lot of them because my girl ends up pulling them off or they end up getting scratched going back and forth from here to her Mom on the weekends. So a three pack at this price? Awesome.
1,Perfect
1,very nice
-1,"I live in Egypt, and use it with Mobinil Wireless 3G USB and it doesn't work"
0,Pink and white usb cable worked great! The black usb cable didn't fit into the port on my phone
1,Good quality
1,The clip that holds the phone is much more solid than the one I had for about a year. It's a solid cell phone holder and the two usb outlets are very convenient.
1,"So far, so good!  No issues whatsoever!  Best hub I've used, bar none!!  I've charged a variety of devices with the 6-Port charging hub using both the cables that came with each device and the Anker 5-Pack Micro USB Cables (3ft x 3 + 6ft + 1ft).  The devices are:<br /><br />2 - Samsung Galaxy S4's<br />Amazon Kindle HDX 7<br />Amazon HD 7<br />Jabra Solemate<br />Jabra Extreme 2 (Bluetooth Headset)<br />Samsung Galaxy Tab 10<br />Nook Color<br /><br />Will certainly order another hub for use elsewhere."
1,Works fine but battery sucks!
1,"Simple, feels good in hand and made up of good quality"
1,"It is a good quality case, but i expected the bumper part to be solid white. However it is a semi transparent, matte white. I still like the case enough for it not to be a big complaint. It is sturdy and very thin, and feels nice in the hand. All the ports and buttons are easily accessible as well."
-1,Neither  cord worked
1,I love this charger. I went from 1% to 3% in less than 30 seconds. I would definitely recommend.
1,Works great and looks good too. Uses your existing Apple Watch charging cable and allows a convenient stand to prop your IPhone or other device to charge overnight while your watch is charging.
1,Good and cheap. Not super grippy.
1,Great product and really small like an hearing aid size
1,"Affordable, and protects enough. Pair this with a decent screen protector and you have a hard to kill phone."
1,I love this case!
1,Great Price!
1,This is a great solar panel. It is thin and very light which makes it easy to put in a backpack without making it heavy and bulky. I was impressed that it could charge my smartphone and a 2000mah battery that I have. I will be getting another panel for some other solar projects that I have in mind.
1,Works well
1,A good job
1,Good
1,"This is by far the best screen protector I've ever had.  It feels, looks and acts like a normal screen.  It was a breeze to install, took just a couple of minutes.  Also, it fit my LG G3 VIGOR perfectly.  The people who reviewed this saying it doesn't fit didn't order for the right phone, there is a difference in the LG G3 and the LG G3 VIGOR.  This is for the vigor, it is a different phone and size.  Edit: I had to come back and add to the review.  A few months after owning this, I had the &#34;ultimate test&#34;.  I dropped my phone, screeched when I saw a crack.  Took off the screen protector and my actual screen was fine.  It did just what it needed to do, the protector cracked, not my phone.,  I immediately ordered a second one, which was just easy to install as the first"
1,Good charged
1,"Awesome phone!!! I gave a shot to this phone based on reviews seen online and I love it! Fast phone, screen looks sharp and the phone looks great. The shipping was extremely fast. It arrived before the expected date. I recommend it..."
1,great
-1,Sucked threw in trash
1,Great
1,"this case is ultra thing. i love it. the back has a texture that makes it not slippery but it is not sticky at all. had it two weeks, love it."
1,This case fit great. I've dropped my phone a few times and I feel so relieved every single time I pick up my phone and see not even a scratch. Definitely worth the price! I recommend getting a screen protector as well as they really do go hand in hand for clumsy ppl like myself! My husband also has this case and forgot his phone on his truck bumper. He found it a few hundred feet away from our house without a scratch nor cracked screen however the lcd inside was cracked! Still amazed it protected the outside of the phone!
1,Great price and easy shopping with promo code. giving fair review is so worth the price :)
1,"Perfect! I bought this as a birthday present and she loved it! Fits perfect, looks good!"
-1,The case is pixilated and rubs off
1,great!
1,"I love this case. It fits perfectly and holds the phone in securely. The only thing missing is a belt clip/protective front cover which if included would make this the perfect rugged case for the Moto G. I don't use my &#34;phone&#34; as a phone. I purchased it for the sole purpose of using it as a backup camera and a link for a Sony action camera so I can use it as a viewfinder. I needed a rugged case that would take some abuse while out in the boonies and this thing delivers. It has a secure grip when my hands are wet and dirty and has taken a few good drops without issue. I do wish it had a front protective covering so when it's in a back pack or bouncing around in the jeep the screen itself would be protected. I did purchase another brand case which came with the belt clip/front cover. Come to find out this MoKo case holds the phone in much more securely and is built a bit tougher so I am just using the front cover from that other case on this one. MoKo, if you read this, please make a front cover/belt clip to go along with this case and I'll buy it. I don't even mind spending more for it since that would make this the perfect combination for the Moto G."
1,Excellent for the price super clear.
1,"After a couples of days a bubble appeared and it won't go away and it's annoying<br /><br />But other than that it's a good case but hard to take off, you have to use a card or something hard"
1,"For the price this is a fantastic cord. For the price it's great, and it's nice that it's a little longer than the standard Apple cord. It feels like it's made with decent quality pieces and parts, and all the connections fit snug, but not too tight.<br /><br />But I'm knocking it down a single star because it has the same issues the Apple cords have, and the end of the wires near the lightning adapter begin to fray after a few months."
1,Just want I needed...
1,Works well
1,"Elegant, high quality, real leather. In summary: What you expect from a BlackBerry case. Really recommended.<br />Now on the other side (nothing to do with the product, but important to mention), I think this case is on the expensive side considering the value of the Cell phone itself. But worth it any penny."
1,"excellent mount, would not expect anything less from Ram"
1,Works great !
1,this charges my phone really quickly. i love it!
1,Works very well with decent range.
1,Great case. It's slim and doesn't add bulk like other cases I've tried. The only bad thing is the clear silicone edge has discolored to a orange color and can't be cleaned (I've had it 9 months now) . I've experienced this same phenomenon with another clear case form a different brand. I'm just assuming that clear silicone isn't the best if you want a truly clear case. I just ordered the same case from i blason except with the black silicone egde so I can still showcase my white phone but now have to worry about the egdes discoloring.
1,"The keyboard paired instantly, and operates properly. This unit is worth the price."
1,"This is a very sleek looking band!  I was a little surprised that it required &#34;some&#34; assembly, as others I've ordered, didn't.  However, that is NOT a deal breaker in any way!  This band looks great!  I love the black color.  Show's up very nice against the contract of the watch rim.  Also looks good to match the watch face.  Simple to install and includes a tool to remove unwanted links.  All in all, a great replacement band at a REALLY great price!<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an unbiased/honest review."
1,Great quality. Fast shipping. Very convenient product.
-1,This was not a genuine Samsung product and stopped working correctly after a few uses.
1,"Delivery of case was sooner than promised! Case is very sturdy and tough, versatile too."
1,Tried this out to make sure it would charge my iPhone 6.  It does.  Looking forward to trips with the kids and keeping all devices charged.
1,Did its job with no problems
1,"Loved it!! Was as pictured n described! Arrived on a Sunday, was a huge surprise that it arrived so soon!!! It is perfect!!!"
1,"So far so good, had it on now for a few weeks and no issues. Keep my phone in my pocket and it isn't collecting dust or anything.  It is rather tight fitting, so getting it onto the phone was a bit tricky.  It actually sent my phone into recovery mode cause it was pressing buttons down while I stretched it on."
1,"Sturdy, durable case. Love how thick the screen protector was. I've dropped my phone 200 times and the case and screen protector has withheld it!!"
1,"Easy to put on, nice and brightly colored. Gave it away to a friend, so don't know about longevity, but it felt nice."
1,Love it.. I have it for a month no.. And 100% okay
1,"I was curious how much Base they would produce I was greatly surprised for a 4 inch. Great sound overall, large magnet does it. For the price great drivers."
-1,Does not work with a phone case on for the iPhone 5s.  Lighting input is too short to successfully link the phone.
1,Best case for anyone that might be prone to dropping there phone. (my 14 daughter)
-1,It broke the first time I took it off
1,Was definitely different to put on but works well and went on fairly easy... Was nervous to try it because it did not just stick on... But works better.
1,Such a cool case! It arrived quickly and the case is of good quality. I love the design so much and is great for any Disney fan! I highly recommend.
1,Fits perfectly!
1,"Compact, easy to use, lots of power. Seems well made. Holds a charge when not in use. Perfect for someone like me that can be in remote areas where I may need to recharge devices several times before getting to an AC power source."
1,Works great. Very little sound distortion with higher volumes. Would recommend.
1,perfec
-1,Didn't even stay on a week.  Kept popping off and was lost.  Don't waste your money.
1,"As described, works well with my Samsung S4 phone, fast charge."
1,Excellent
1,Loud and crystal clear sound
-1,"Bought this for my son's birthday because he wanted a great case for his iPhone and this is the one he chose.  It shipped promptly and came as described.  Within two weeks my son dropped his iPhone in a shallow bowl of water and it was submerged for about 5 seconds.  Water had gotten under the case, even though the case &#34;appeared&#34; to be tightly clamped.  iPhone was immediately removed from the case and placed in a bag of rice for the next 5 days.  No dice, iPhone is ruined.  False claim on the water resistant description.  If you want a case that looks nice, then go for it.  If you want a case that actually does what it says, then pass on this one."
-1,This charger does not work. I will have to return it.
1,BEST ITE******FAST SHIPPING*******A+++++++++++++
-1,hard to get phone out when need to use it
1,It's good. Warranty rocks.
1,Nice material. Good grip. happy with the quality
1,Like this very much.  Very easy to install.  It is ridiculous that the shipping and handling cost more than the item itself.  Hence four stars instead of five.
1,make my life so much easier with a crazy cat that chews cable....recommend to anyone who has a monster pet
1,Does what it's suppose to. Nice quality & fair price.
1,My dad was happy
1,To Thick
1,I love how this case looks! It is super lightweight does not add any bulk or weight to my phone.  That being said I do not think it offers very much protection either.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
1,Excellent device. Bit my phone like a dream and makes my phone look very cool. Thank you very much.  I would recommend this item to anyone that asked.
1,"Just purchased this item, and it works great! Very slim so it's not bulky in my car.  The clarity is great.  Sound is clear.  Seems to be exactly what I was looking for!"
1,"I would recommend this product to my family and friends. It have been used almost 4 weeks with no problems and it charged very fast. I am very happy with the product, very good price and quality. I will buy it again from the company."
1,I live in a travel trailer and the stock ceiling speakers that came with my new trailer just weren't cutting it. For $50 I'm jamming some better tunes.
-1,Loud static noice. Not usable.
1,Best car charger I've ever had chargers so quick everyone that has quick charge on their phone should have this charger. Especially if your phone supports quick charge 2.0.
1,"These headphones have been life-changing for me! They are so comfortable to wear because you don't have to stick them in your ear.  They are perfect for any kind of activity, they stay put very well.  They are defintely sweat proof.  They charge quickly and the battery lasts for a lot longer than one would think.  They are easy to use and even have controls for volume, play/pause, next/previous tracks right on the ear! Whats more, they coil up and fit into any pocket or bag."
1,Now I have someplace to plug in all those USB devices without having to take up space on the power strip
-1,Did not fit my phone. Way too big for my phone. Unsatisfied...
1,wasnt big enough
1,"This product saved an Amazon Kindle Fire HD when Amazon themselves would not support the device or offer a replacement after one of their updates left the device in an unbootable state.<br /><br />My daughter has a tendency to fill her kindle with videos and junk.  This causes a known issue where if the File System gets too full it can actually corrupt, crash, and become unbootable, especially if an update is pushed and not enough space for a proper install remains.<br /><br />Amazon has not fixed this issue (HTC used to have a simialr issue on one of their phones but they did fix it).<br />So the Kindle was stuck on the screen that says it failed to boot and gave the 2 options of try again or reset to factory defaults.  Neither worked.<br />Amazon, when called acknowledged the issue but said since the Kindle was out of warranty even though the issue was known there was nothing they could do beyond offer a lousy 10% off on a new Kindle device.<br /><br />Hop over to XDA, look up issue, find solution, requires cable, and download of a fresh ROM image.<br />Use fastboot cable to boot device, use Amazon's own stock image file to restore device.<br />Reboot device, fixed and just like new.<br />Sign into account, restore apps, done.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing Amazon.  At least users at XDA and this cable helped."
1,If the price had of been any lower the seller would have paid me to take it. Great purchase
-1,"It works, but don't find it to be that great. Reports have indicated that I sound much better via the HT; furthermore, the speaker, within the unit, puts out muffled sound. I would not recommend this product."
1,Plugs into the wall (with adapter) and then plugs in to the device. Charging/Syncing happens. Goal achieved.
-1,Doesn't work with two LTE. Just buy one usimed iPhone...
0,Have to press down hard to write with it
1,The only thing this watch is missing is a heart rate monitor. Otherwise I love it!
-1,It didn't work for my Zune device but the cable looked pretty new to me.
1,Slim and protects the phone very well. Would buy again!
-1,It doesn't fit well!
1,Fits the phone perfectly. Comfortable and easy to wear.
1,I've had this phone case for a while. I'm constantly dropping my phone and it still has never cracked the screen or anything with this case on.
1,"I love Caseology cases. This is my second case from them, and I couldn't be happier. My only concern happened on my first case: the brand name wore off after being taken out and put in my pocket so many times. Besides that, I love it! Would recommend to anyone looking for a plain case."
1,I Give you only 4 stars because is working only ps3
1,Screen installation was a breeze! It lasted for a good ample amount of time! Will purchase again!
1,It just came in a nice bubble wrap and looks and feels great. Fits my phone perfectly. Favorite phone case I ever had!
-1,Bulky and phone is too far forward.
1,Quality product
1,"It seems to work as expected.  A bit bulkier than I expected, but manageable."
1,"This is far and away the best Bluetooth headset I have ever owned for the purpose of working out. Let's start with the most important attribute for this niche: does it stay in your ears? I guess there are individual differences, results could vary, but in my ears at least it is as though the creature from Alien has attached itself but probably a little more comfortable (I don't know about wearing them for hours and hours but for a typical 60 minute workout they are more than comfortable enough). They stay in place even when running, even when getting very sweaty, perfectly fine in dynamic moves, functional fitness suspending upside down, whatever.... You do sometimes need to fiddle with them a bit to get them to sit properly at the start but once they are in, they are in.<br /><br />Next factor is audio quality: it is not audiophile level but IMO the best wireless sound I have experienced (though I have never sought out Bluetooth headsets primarily for sound quality) and more than enough for the kind of environments it would typically be used in: Bass is a little heavy but not overpowering, sound is clear and there are many wired headsets that would fall short.<br /><br />Noise isolation: simply put: very good. Possibly too good: you won't hear them coming. I personally prefer more ambient noise to be allowed in to make them better for running. Also you do get that &#34;internal sound amplification&#34; when you are running because they do make a seal with your ears. Therefore, they are definately better for workouts over jogs, but functional for either.<br /><br />Bonuses: spoken feedback &#34;Power on&#34;; &#34;Connection Successful&#34;; &#34;Battery low&#34;. Battery power indication on the iPhone (never seen that before, maybe I am getting old but seemed very nifty to me). That power indication is a little optimistic though, unlike the voice-nag that will start telling you &#34;Power low&#34; every few seconds about 10 minutes before the battery runs out (it is not the worst in this department though).<br /><br />My only major gripe with this headset is the button placement and function: firstly both sides have the same grooves, so that by feel you can't easily tell which side has the buttons on it (should I be able to remember that the buttons are on the left? Sure, there's that getting old again. But if, like me, you can't remember what side of the car your gas tank is on after 8 years, you will struggle with this). Secondly, it is hard to locate the gap between buttons such as volume/next-prev track and stop/start. As a consequence, I find it fiddly to control volume and tracks from the unit itself and I tend to just go to the phone to do it. Depending on how easy that is for you, the button position could get annoying. I can live with it, but it is not &#34;the best&#34; in this category.<br /><br />Waterproofing: tested once by putting it (accidentally) in the washing machine. Alas, my unit did not survive this, but personally that was not within expectations. So that is the limit. In terms of rain/sweat seems fine. But I wouldn't use it while paddling or anything.<br /><br />Battery life: is excellent and is as good or better than advertised.<br /><br />Finally, it is a possibly a poor hands-free (so says the only person I ever called on it). But I didn't care enough about this feature to really test it extensively (I like hearing that I have a call coming but happy to switch to the phone at that point and not use the headset while driving). Read other reviews if you intend to use it extensively for making phone calls as this possibly a serious shortcoming (if you need this).<br /><br />Well done Photive for a great and very well priced headset.s not the worst in this department though).<br /><br />My only major gripe with this headset is the button placement and function: firstly both sides have the same grooves, so that by feel you can't easily tell which side has the buttons on it (should I be able to remember that the buttons are on the left?

1,I needed this so as to charge my phone while on the move. Works great. Order was delivered ahead of scheduler. It's in my car now to use anytime.
1,"PROS: Minimal and easy snap on protective case. Love the clear. iPhones are too good looking to cover up with a bulky, opaque case. The plastic is good quality and has some flexibility, so case buttons are easy and will not stick. I rely on this case and a protective tempered glass screen protector to breathe easy when I drop it. And I do drop it - and my phone stays safe and brand new looking! (I used this same case style and my last phone looked mint for years). CONS: Only 1. The case will slowly start to yellow over months, most noticeably around the 8th or 9th month in use. I like to replace the case every 5 months."
0,"I gave the cord 3 stars because it only lasted me 6 months. Now, to be fair, I did use it a LOT (more than I've a day, EVERY day). But on the whole, I feel it should have held up longer."
1,Great deal
1,great phone
1,Easy to install. But about a week later my wife dropped the phone and the screen cracked. I did warn her that it was not gorilla glass. Wont bother replacing it again.
1,"Looking at this device as insurance, I see its appeal, having lost keys a few days ago for the first time in years and losing many hours in hopes of finding them, only for my daughter to find them by accident. This device lasts only about a year and cannot be recharged; the company offers a recycling opportunity that includes buying new devices at discount. I found the fob itself a bit bulky and doubt how useful it would be to attach to everyday devices such as remote controls. However, the idea of throwing one into one's luggage and/or backpack appeals to me, and it would certainly be a smart investment for one who tends to misplace particular items a lot. It works as advertised, as well. Just don't look at it as a one-time purchase. It isn't."
1,It was great.  Good quality and easy to slip on phone.
1,Not as tacky (grippy) as I had hoped from the description. Still feels like good quality rubberized plastic and definitely thin.
1,Great case. Works as advertised.
1,"I own a 2005 Equinox and it was one year shy of getting an aux-in. And 1 year too new to get a cassette player. So I have been stuck using FM transmitters. I have gone through several in the last ten years and they never worked very well. My car was great at picking up radio stations from mexico but it could never get a good signal from the fm transmitter. A few months ago I bought this and it has blown away all the other fm transmitters I have owned. The sound quality is great, I can hardly tell the difference between it and an aux in.<br />The good:<br />Sound quality is fantastic. Very clear strong signal far better than any other’s I have tried.<br />Bluetooth connects right to the phone once I get in the car and start it up.<br />Dial on the top makes tuning stations easy<br />No need for batteries, has a usb slot for powering device.<br /><br />The anti-good:<br />My car has the accessory-power jacks between the seats so that puts my fm transmitter in a bit of a hole. So for my car the neck isn’t long enough so a passenger is needed to manipulate it while driving. If you car has the jacks in a normal place, than you are fine.<br />No auto-scan. But that’s ok cause I haven't ever been impressed with those. The tuner on this works better.<br /><br />Update:<br />Recently it stopped working. Had a short or something. So I emailed the company and they sent me a new one no questions asked. Fantastic support!"
1,Excellent!! Love !!
1,worked just as described and no issues with cord not supporting the device
-1,"It is very bad, i will not buy it again."
1,"I bought these for traveling on the bus to keep people from talking to me.  It worked.  I also have issues with ear buds staying in my ear.  These stayed on my head nicely.  The sound is quite good.  The buttons are solid.  I give it 4 stars because the power button takes some getting used to.  Otherwise, you can't beat a great pair of headphones for this price."
-1,Doesn't fit my phone properly...a tad too small.
1,"So affordable, fits the screen perfectly, and came with instructions that made it SO easy to install perfectly. 10/10 would buy again."
1,For 20 dollars these are outstanding speakers! Well made! Quality looks better than my much more expensive speakers. BUY THESE! At this price its a steal!
1,"Bit bigger than expected but damn does it hold a charge. I gave it to my sister before she took a trip to Dubai, she only stayed there for 4 days but swears she only used the bank for charging her iphone 6 and never plugged it to an AC charger. She came back with 2 out of 4 battery bars left. Wow."
0,Doesn't fit with otter box on.
1,Works well so far.  All you have to is place the phone on the pad.  No cables to deal with.
1,It fits perfectly and protects my phone while making it easy to access.
1,So tiny yet so useful. I don't like carrying a wallet most of the time so this CardBuddy stretch allows me to carry just the essentials a credit card some cash and Id and bus card. 5 stars works great and gets the job done. Attaches to phone or case. I received a discounted sample in exchange for an unbiased review.
1,"Great case, can't get any better for the price."
1,"So far, so good. I'm really enjoying all the features on my new phone. I looked at a bunch of reviews online before purchasing, and decided that this was the best phone for the money. I have had zero issues with it, and it does everything that I need it to. Camera even takes pretty good pictures! I'm impressed, but then, I already was a fan of ASUS."
1,No complaints -- tested all 3 and they work as expected. Will update if any quality issues crop up but so far so good.
-1,"Incredibly thin and cheap feeling, the image is awesome but there is NO protection at all. Also let the package air out a few days, the fumes coming off these has got to be toxic."
1,Perfect
0,Not bad
1,These are solid. I love the cloth style. I forgot my first one in a hotel room so I got another one. That's how much I love this product. I use it all the time.
1,I received it in a timely manner and the fit is perfect. Nice product. Thank you
1,Great product for maximizing the lighter outlet in my car and allowing me to charge 2 things at once.  The iSmart power control is great.
1,Received it promptly a very solid case and looks great on my new S6 edge plus no issues at all
-1,Do not like it very much.
0,This worked well for a few months but the cord separated from the part that goes into the phone and then stopped working. Not fun.
0,"The case works, but stays a little open. No big deal anyway. Doesn't seem to be a great protection, the back is too hard."
-1,This did NOT fit my phone.
1,Good for this phone
0,I can't wait to try it out
1,Product was exactly what I wanted for a fraction of price that Verizon charges!
-1,The case started cracking after only 2 weeks. It's cute but won't last.
1,This case is incredible!  I've dropped my phone many times and the screen is perfect!  It is lightweight and not as bulky as other cases.  Easy to put on.  Just snap it on!
-1,"I bought this product for my iphone 4 and it did not charge my phone, disappointed."
1,My wife loves the case!
1,great
1,great performace for the price !!
1,Easy  to hold & charge the watch.
1,"Great case!  I've had mine for a few months now, and it looks and performs great!"
1,works great good imaging like the downvue ferature
1,Great
1,Just what I needed.
0,Cute case but it broke the first time I dropped it.
1,We ate very pleased.
1,Exactly what i was looking for. fits right into my little home office and I can charge 2 kindles and cell phones as well. arrived on time in perfect condition.
1,"When considering purchasing this phone case I, per normal, read all the reviews and was encouraged that this would be a safe purchase.<br />I won't keep you but I just want to say, BUT THIS CASE!!! All the 4 & 5 star reviews are dead on target. I can't find anything negative to report so relax and hit the &#34;add to shopping cart&#34; button, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Have a great day!"
-1,Case does not fit phone. Just lying around
-1,"It was really tough to put on and a plastic piece near the left side, top button broke off."
1,Got this for my wife.  She really likes it.  The only issue is that the case is too think for the wireless charger to work correctly.
1,Item as described.
1,For my wife and she absolutely loves it.
0,Scratch the case very easily.  A little disappointed.
-1,I was ordering for a galaxy light these did not work
1,I got it last week and just started using it and so far it works great.
1,"This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  This is a really nice quality leather wallet case.  It was easy to install and I was able to successfully put in a drivers license, debit card in a couple folded bills.  I really like how the lower pocket is see through for my license, something I haven't had with other wallet cases.  The magnet strap works well and easily slides in and out of my deep front jeans pocket.  My one suggestion would be to have the inner case that actually holds the phone, extend a letter farther to serve more as a bumper,  just in case it drops face down, while open.  Overall, very satisfied so far, And this will be my go to case when I go out and don't want a bulky wallet in my back pocket"
0,"Fits phone great! Love color and the Como .... my problem with it is it looked worn down, old, and peeling on back from day 1 .... thought it would look new for a while, but I have droped it a couple of times and phone was not hurt, phone being safe is more important than looks in my opinion."
1,Better than expected!
1,A very good product! My wife and I both have one and we are very happy with them.
1,I love my new phone case! I have had lots of compliments on it as well! I have had only had it for a month or so....how long it holds up is yet to be determined!
1,"They're awesome!  Easy interface, and stay in my ears very well."
0,Love using it to watch tv on my phone. Clamp slips under the weight of my phone (iPhone 6 Plus). Would be nicer if it had a clamp that I could adjust at the base...but it wasn't very expensive...
1,I got this for a discount for an honest review.<br /><br />I like that it sticks to things that you can put a suction cup on. It so far has seemed slightly more reliable connection but it hasn't taken the water test like another speaker that I have. It seems pretty sturdy to kids for instance as mine like to walk around with it maybe throwing it a little around listening to things like &#34;teen Beach&#34; songs or &#34;Phineas and Ferb the Musical&#34;.
-1,Boooooo...
0,"Review:<br />The outer shell of the case is reminiscent of the Incipio Dual PRO iPhone 5 without the plastic backing. It feels very fragile and like rubber when touching the outer shell. I'm not 100% confident this will protect my phone when dropped (I guess we will find out overtime). The case is slightly heavier than the Incipio and almost feels like the weight of the morphie with the battery pack.  The design is a little too thick on the outer shell also. Would have preferred a thinner profile design on the outer case as this reminds me of the 1989 bulky phones. It doesn't compliment the elegant thin profile design of the iPhone 5 and does alot to hide it.<br /><br />For installation, contrary to what the instructions show, I felt like the case was going to break when attempting to peel off the soft outer rubber. Installing it back on was slightly difficult also. Took about 5 minutes to install the case and I missed one of the adhesive pieces so it peeled off my existing screen protector slightly.<br /><br />One thing I was very excited about was that it had a built in screen protector. Case is $15.95 and a screen protector alone is $5-7. So your basically getting a $10 case with a screen protector that will last you forever. I'm definitely not a fan of how the screen protector feels though. It feels like hard plastic and is difficult when you want to swipe your phone left or right. You can definitely feel the resistance. Tapping works fine without any issues. This is probably one of the drawbacks to a built in screen protector.<br /><br />The rubber covers over the vibration, AUX and lightning port are great for keeping the dust out also. They are a little difficult to remove which can be problematic if you are driving and trying to plug your phone in for some music. A better design would have been without the rubber covers.<br /><br />Now let's get to the part that I do not like at all. If a case is going to be both aesthetically pleasing and built to protect the phone, your better off building one for the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. The interchangeable plates are great if you want to switch up the look of your phone. But if you own the iPhone 5 or 5S, you will have to look at the ugly camera circles on top built for the other version. In fact, there is a flaw design here. Why is there an extra circle to the left of the top one where the camera lens is? I checked the iPhone 5S and there is no camera lens in this position.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this case if you don't mind the nuisances that I have listed below. It's not a bad case but could be incredible if New Trent fixes the flaws that I have listed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Built in screen protector<br />+Interchangeable back plates<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Case feels like cheap plastic.<br />-Bulky<br />-Flawed camera hole design for both iPhone 5/iPhone 5S.<br />-Difficult to swipe left or right with built-in screen protector<br />-Rubber cover for AUX/Lightning port/Phone Vibrate difficult to remove."
1,"Excelent budget bluetooth speaker with decent battery life.  It's not as rugged as other models but this will allow it to be even more portable.  The volume does not go up as loud as I would like it to.  Still, for $22, it's a great deal."
-1,It wasn't what I was expecting I thought it was going to be a little thicker and one of those kind that you have to screw in
0,"Gets dirty really easily and you have to continually clean it! The material is great, and it protects the phone as advertised."
1,"looks good, shows off the back of my (customized) phone. not sturdy enough to count on for too much protection, but better than nothing."
1,Worth every penny!
-1,I literally had this product less then a month before every single one of the cables springs that keep the cord in the phone went out and now and the cord just falls out of my phone
1,This is THE best one I have come across and the built in aux cord is thick and sturdy. Great quality and the buttons to control the tunes are of good quality as well. The sound is no different then sliding in a store bought CD. Puts off the perfect amount of treble and bass.
1,"First let me start by saying I’ve purchased many Anker products over the years, however this PowerCore 20100 I am writing about was supplied as a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />I buy Anker products because 1. They work as advertised,  2. They hold up (my first purchase was an Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh External Battery which has made two trips to Disney World, and I continue to use often),  3. Great warranty (18 Months) 4. The only time I needed their customer support it was top rate. (helping me diagnose an issue, sending me replacement, ultimately resolving the issue in a professional and courteous manner.).<br /><br />Now that we are carrying our iPads with us more often, my wife and I were looking for something with higher capacity than our Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh battery.The PowerCore 20100 appeared to be a good candidate, so I appreciate being sent the sample.<br /><br />My first opinions taking it out of the box are that it's smaller than I expected.  I mean based on the 2nd Gen Astro3's size and the PowerCore being almost twice the capacity I expected it to be twice the size.  While it is taller, it's skinnier, isn't any thicker and feels only slightly larger.  While the PowerCore is heavier (per Anker’s web page), it really isn’t that noticeable either.  Its nice if you need to carry it around.<br /><br />Anker's web site claims it can &#34;Charge an iPhone 6 seven times, a Galaxy S6 five times or an iPad mini twice.&#34;  Based on my usage, that is pretty spot on.  I was able to charge my 2013 Moto X about 8 times.  I was able to nearly fully charge both our iPad 2 and iPad Air 2 simultaneously  (which have larger batteries than an iPad Mini so its what I expected.).  The listing on Amazon has a chart reflecting the ability to charge an iPad Air 1.7 Times, so again, that claim reflects what I saw.<br /><br />Due to Anker's Power IQ technology, Voltage Boost, and 4.8A output, the PowerCore puts out the best current and voltage to charge all my devices at full speed, even when two devices are plugged in.  Charging my iPad Air 2 with the PowerCore 20100 (and an Anker Lightning cable) took the same amount of time as using the standard iPad adapter.<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 does accept 2A input to charge it which helps with the recharge time. I can't say exactly how long it takes to fully recharge as I plugged the PowerCore into an Anker 40w 5 port Desktop Charger before going to bed, along with my other devices, and it was fully charged when I woke.  My estimate would be 6-8hrs to fully charge it.  While using the wall wart from my iPad Air 2 to charge the PowerCore overnight, it took a little longer than using the Anker charger (more like 7-9hrs).<br /><br />In the box you’ll find the PowerCore 20100, a 2ft MicroUSB cord, and a form fitting bag to hold them. Just as with the Astro3,  I put the PowerCore into the bag and left it there. I tucked the MicroUSB cable in side when walking around with it. The PowerCore has 4 LED’s to show how much power the battery has left, and two USB ports to plug in those devices you wish to charge.<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 feels good in the hand and is easy to carry.  I used to to charge an iPhone 6, Nexus 6, 2013 Moto X, Samsung Galaxy S5,  iPad 2, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, Moto 360.  Unlike my Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh battery, the PowerCore 20100 did not charge my Nikon S8200 camera.<br /><br />If I had to state a “CON” or “draw back” it would be that I miss having the port for a 3rd device (the 2nd Gen Astro3 has 3 USB ports).  It was handy, especially when in Disney for my wife and I to plug our phones and digital camera in all at the same time.  However, since I would mostly use the PowerCore 20100 with higher capacity devices, like my iPads,  having two ports isn’t that bad.<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 builds on the features that made me love my 2nd Gen Astro 3, while  increasing its capacity without adding that much size/weight. It provides higher output current (4.8A),  adds Voltage Boost,  so it charges my more power hungry devices faster and more often which is a major plus!<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 is a great External Battery for the road warrior who is away from an AC outlet for extended periods, or needs extra power for their higher capacity tablets."
-1,I contacted Samsung customer service and I had bought the had I adapter 4.0 and they said I need the 3.0 and that didn't work with the Samsung tablet 4!!!! POS!!!
1,better to replace this then the phone screen. Yes will not go to the edges but covers the parts you need it to and is easy to put on.
1,protects well
-1,"Save your money, a few dollars more and you can have a nice unit, lots of little things out of sync.like you have to figure out how to delet / add radio stations[ 3 week no luck], trying to get the right mounting kit is a frustrating exercise, instruction book is as clear as mud"
0,"Eh, it is better than a cracked screen, but like other reviewers noted you can only see the images head on.  If you are looking at an angle or tilting the screen you cant see anything.  Clarity is lacking.  But, it doesnt make sense to buy a high grade screen for a phone this old, when you could buy a whole new phone for the same price."
1,Great unit so far. Use weather and traffic apps linked to cellphone.
-1,The plastic clamshell casing at the Lightning connector end broke open. The epoxy/grey glue was still in place. No signs of bent or broken wiring/epoxy. Not worth the money.
1,nice product
-1,the phone couldn't be activated and never will be able to get activated again.
1,BUENO
1,"Cons:<br /><br />- Sound quality is merely okay. A bit thin sounding--lacking bass. Not ideal for serious music listening.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Excellent phone headset (which is what I bought them for)<br />- Bluetooth stuff works great, with great range, and low confusion.<br />- They stay in my ears much better than other earbuds I've tried. I haven't tried running, but if I do, I'll update<br />- So nice not having wires everywhere! I like to pace when I'm on the phone, and now I can do it without wires everywhere."
1,"Practical, for keeping my phone safe with a beautiful print. Love it."
1,Bought for my Dad who loves the ease of use-
1,"Car Charger - Powerful 3 Port USB Car Cigarette Lighter Charger, Vano - Charge 3 Devices at Once at Full Speed - For Car, RV + Truck - DC Input 12-24V  FOR REVIEW<br />excellent multi purpose lighter port charger, you simply plug it in and plug it in it is that simple. you will find that this is  very high quality before it is ever removed from the box, i suspect you will not want to loose this device and will be angered slightly if such a event happens as well treat it with care my friends"
1,Just as described.
1,"Works great! I especially love that it takes a standard USB cable for charging. I had a similar shower speaker from another manufacturer, but it took a specific &#34;wall wart&#34; AC adapter with an unusually small plug to charge it. It also didn't have the power specs on it, so I couldn't substitute another AC adapter when I misplaced the one that came with it. This one allows me to use a standard USB cable that I can find just about anywhere to charge it. Big plus. Sounds great too."
1,Directed electronics is very vague with info on install instructions but if you can figure it out this is a breeze to install. Just a few connections and your done.
1,my wife seems to like the case
1,Awesome!!! Very pleased just came in great quality.
1,Great product. Works well and we use it daily. So convenient.
-1,"I bought the 16 GB and 2 gb ram, and it´s a pain in the neck, I´m coming from a nexus 5 with 2gb of ram and the difference is huge, the zenfone 2 got stuck if you´re actively using 2 apps ex: Google music and Facebook, the ram usage is almost all of the time over the 90% causing Lag, the OS drains really fast the battery(8 hours per charge) and that is really bad for a 3000 battery, and finally the latest update 40.61 bricked my cellphone(not rooted or modified), I have to say if you want this phone go for the 64GB and 4 gb ram because the 2 gb ram is a real pain in the neck..."
1,Excellent product
1,Just what I needed
-1,Didn't stay in my phone
1,I love this case. It's saved my phone more times than I can count!
-1,Cracked on the edge and cut my finger because it did not fully cover the whole samsung galaxy 6 edge. Used for 1 week
0,"I'm sure this is a good kit for other vehicles. But it Doesn't Fit the '94 S-10 pickup when installing a single DIN head unit. I have yet to find an adapter that works for this application on it's own. So I bought the Metra 99-4544, which also doesn't work. Going to Frankenstein the two."
-1,This battery was a total fake! It charged but couldn't hold up a charge. I was so shocked to see that my old battery of over 24 months still performed much better than this junk I purchased. This battery is a complete waste of money and time. I charged it FULLY before I started using it and it still didn't deliver any better hope.<br />My advice: Don't buy this piece of worthless junk
1,A solid performer as an everyday belt clip with the added bonus of heavy duty protection. I recommend b
-1,Broke at the seam on top of view area after four days.  Junk!
1,"Portable Charger arrived promptly, was inexpensive, and worked great. Highly recommend."
0,Don't stay around the ears very well. Not horrible. Not the best I've had.
1,"Nice case, fits perfectly. My son loves it"
1,Works as it should. I just wish the cord wasn't so darn long.
1,"I found the IPhone 6 Armor Case not only attractive, a great buy but very duyone.rable.  I have dropped my phone several times and case did not suffer any damages, and the phone did not break or crack.  Well worth the money and makes a great gift."
1,Great case
1,Good
1,Work as expected. 3 Months of use so far and no complain.
1,Easy to install...no fuss...no bubbles
-1,Stopped working after second use.
1,"Very functional, and makes driving and using the phone much safer.  Never have to dig into my pockets to get my phone when a call comes in while I am driving.  With a Bluetooth set up and the Macally, it is truly a hands off phone use."
1,"As everyone else is saying, it's not protective. But if you want to be able to feel your iPhone and look nice. This is what you want. My phone feels nice and thin and looks great but again, would put a thicker case on it if I were going out and about."
1,Compact and does the job.
1,hard to get charger that works great and good price.
-1,"Made very cheap, don't waste your money!"
1,I love my case. Just what I wanted.
1,Very nice for the price.
1,"Very happy with these, especially for the price. I purchased them to wear while doing tasks in the yard or in the workshop. Sound quality is surprisingly good for a pair of cheap headphones. Works very well with my Note 4"
1,I love the color its exactly what I was expecting thank you
1,These cases are great!!  They last a long time and don't show as much wear as some others.
1,Great fits my phone perfect.  Enjoy the just enough of the rubber it helps grip so my phone doesn't fall out of my pocket.
1,Excellent
1,Worked great. Happy with it.
-1,it wasn´t the original item
1,good Batt!
1,"Nice case.  covers well, like small fabric styrofoam.  Shockabsorbent.  You can record while it's it in if you have a microphone."
1,very satisfied with this case.
0,"The pink part gets dirty quickly but surprisingly the white part stays clean. I haven't found anything that will get the pink part clean again, a scrub with good ole soap and water doesn't cut it."
1,"Very handy, works great for a multiphone family."
-1,"UPDATE September 6, 2015: Tab snapped off while inserting a new phone for use with this. It did not fall or get banged, It just snapped off with an iphone 5S. Also, it broke before we even had a chance to pair it with the phone. Therefore, lowering my rating to two stars. See picture.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: This monopod is almost identical to another I just reviewed but this one is about $5.00 cheaper and comes in this awesome hot pink color (my 12-year-old niece will go gaga over this) although the color is listed as red (it’s pink). The instructions are clearly printed on the back of the box and it’s a pretty straightforward set up. Assembly and pairing are simple and intuitive and you can setup and use this within five minutes of opening the box. The device has a charge already but comes with a USB charging cord and it’s probably a good idea to give it a full charge once it’s set up. That takes about an hour or so.<br /><br />The camera button is on the ribbed rubberized handle making it easy to hold and snap without much effort. On switch and mini USB charging port are o the base of the stick. The stick extends to about a yard in length. But the longer you extend the stick, the harder it is to maneuver, FYI.  This applies to all selfie sticks, not specifically this one.<br /><br />It would be nice to add the port for a tripod but otherwise very nice.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion."
1,I had a issue with my last order so they sent me new ones and they work perfect
0,"The concept is great, the product seems to be pretty good - decent strength magnet; with that being said, it didn't work for me.  The magnet is only strong enough to go through a thin phone case.  I have a hard plastic case with one of those kickstands in the back (still a pretty thin case though)and the magnet just wasn't strong enough for the level of thickness."
1,I've had no issues with this whatsoever. In his chores my son's iPhone five and my iPhone 6. I actually came to buy another one and cannot believe the negative reviews.
1,Love it.  Great quality. Shipping was fast too
1,Fits the phone perfectly for charging
1,"Cables work really good, the different sizes that you get in this assorted pack are a plus. I earlier got a pack of smaller ones, but having several cables in different sizes works better."
1,"Doesn't have the range of other Bluetooth adapters, but it's portability makes it worth it"
1,This case has great features. I love the colors and the kickstand.
1,Good quality with cheap price.
-1,Excellent case up until it came apart at the seem between the clear back and the black perimeter.I put the case on m phone never took it off and noticed today that it was coming apart.
1,Great item.
1,Excellent
1,"Now I can tell my phones from my son's...LOL It doesn't seem to be quite as securely on the phone as the original one I had, but I like it a lot."
1,"Just a replacement phone for my little brother, got the job done."
-1,"Otter Box makes great cases even though they are expensive. However i have noticed that if not used with the holster the rubber slip cover will stretch out relatively fast. In the case of this one, it took only 4 months. The one i had for my S4 lasted about 10 months. The Real Tree cases sold by Otter Box seem to have a better rubber cover than the standard Otter Box. That case lasted over 1.5 years, without any sign of wear and tear, until i got a new phone. The cost of the Real Tree case was $15-$20 cheaper but was a better product. I do not recommend these products anymore and have moved a better maker called Kecko."
1,I've purchased many screen protectors in the past and have always had trouble with installation. I had absolutely no problems with installation with this one. I followed the instructions and the screen protectors went on without a hitch on 2 phones. Great product!
1,"So, I had to get a replacement transmitter becuase the first one did not cooperate. But I send JETech a email stating that the transmitter didnt work and I wanted a refund. They offered to send me a replacement, once I got the replacement and connected it to my radio, IT WORKED! An amazing product, barely any static, just have to find a great signal on an fm station. BUY IT!!!!!"
0,Your basic USB!
1,"Thanks, UberZonClub.com"
1,Simply great.
1,"I have had this case on my phone for a few months and overall it's a really good quality case. I do drop my phone and this case has protected my phone and it hasn't cracked or anything. It does get scratched and gouged easily, but it is plastic so I guess that is to be expected. The thing that I'm currently experiencing is that the last time I dropped it, it got a gouge right where I hold it and it's fairly sharp. This is making it uncomfortable for me to hold so I'm going to try to file it down so I don't have to completely purchase a new case.<br />For the price this is a good case and it's really cute! I can charge my phone easily with it on as well. It reminds me of Kate Spade, but without the price!"
-1,after a few weeks of having this product I thought it was great although the discomfort on not being able to move the ear buds in the direction that you may like to make it feel comfortable. I rate it a 1 star on account after the first few weeks it died on me and no longer works...therefore all I need to say is thank you for the rip off.
1,Cases looked good and performed well - would suggest that the moulding to hold the phone be beefed up as the thinnest part breaks
1,Great charger works better than new.
1,love the texture of the material so much better than most of the products in market
1,Ok
1,great price for 5 working cables!
0,This product didn't work well for my needs.  I am not saying it isn't a good product. It just didn't work for my application.
1,I love it.
0,They were delivered very quickly and looks exactly as pictured.  My only problem is I cant go across the room without the signal being lost. Probably will be looking for another pair with better range.
1,This is an adorable phone cover. It arrived in a very timely manner and I am impressed with the quality of the product.
1,Great construction and I can keep my phone in it's case!
1,Great USB Battery and wonderful value!
-1,"Is there any way to rate an item with MINUS stars? If so, I would rate this hunk of $#!+ a MINUS TEN STARS!!<br /><br />I bought this thing about a year ago in anticipation of converting all of my cassettes to MP3 when I retired. I tried to get this piece of garbage to work and it failed in every respect.<br /><br />I loaded the program from the disc and it instructed me to download iTunes, which I did. When I tried to initiate the program to start recording, I got a message that I again needed to download iTunes. I ran a repair program from iTunes to no avail. STILL WOULDN'T WORK!!<br /><br />Bottom line: I could not get my computer, using Windows 7 Pro, to recognize this thing in any way shape or form. I'm not going to send it back because I don't want some other unfortunate person to get this $#!+Y thing. I'm taking a 5 lb. sledge hammer to it first thing in the morning."
0,The color on the decal when I received it was dull.
-1,"Did not have a good experience with these. They looked nice and they were comfortable. The problem was the sound quality was inconsistant between both ears and overall not that good.<br />Amazon was great with the return, I ended up paying a little more $39 and getting the Symphonized headphones which are amazing all around and come with a 1 yr warranty."
-1,Fell apart in a few weeks at every hinge. Not recommended.
1,Super loud and clear.  I was really surprised on how great they sound for how inexpensive these speakers are.  You can hear me coming 5 blocks away on my golf cart.  I have exactly 100 pure watts RMS running to each of them and I can't get them to distort.  Great product so far.  Highly recommend
0,"I am torn about this review because this wooden stand is great if you have multiple electronics as it solves the problem of how/where to charge everything without having your house look cluttered. Unfortunately, I have a few concerns which I will mention and perhaps the design can be modified for the future. If nothing else, I hope to help those who have multiple electronics understand what they can use this with.<br /><br />The first concern is that the watch charging stand is in an awkward spot. Because of its placement, it can't accomodate two nice long holders toward the rear (for someone with two iPods) so there is only one long slot and two short ones toward the front. This is fine if you are charging an iPod, Kindle and a phone, but not two larger electronics. This issue could be solved with just an inch more depth to the base. The slots could also be a bit wider to allow thicker covers on the iPad/iPhone. My iPad Air has a thin cover and fits fine, but my older generation iPad (which the children use) has a thicker leather cover which is barely able to be squeezed in.<br /><br />The second caveat is that the items you want to have reside here will need to be on their side in order to allow for the charging cord, and not upright like the stock photo shows regarding the phone. That isn't an issue for me, but I wanted to point that out.<br /><br />I manipulated the configuration to work for me by placing the smaller iPad on top of the second wooden wedge instead of in the groove (see the photo) and it seems to be holding up fine.<br /><br />Last of all, the silicone spacer protectors don't stick to the varnished wood. A little Super Glue would work to solve that problem.<br /><br />All in all, and the reason that I am torn, is that this is a decent, sturdy and nice-looking holder for a great price (I paid just under $16 for mine). There aren't many other three or four item holders out there that you'll ever see for a cost even close to this. So the bottom line is that if you aren't worried about a few minor modifications, this may be the holder/charging station for you.is that if you aren't worried about a few minor modifications, this may be the holder/charging station for you."
-1,This case was a piece of crap. It was not shockproof or dirt proof. Save your money.
1,Give a four star FOR NOW ... BUT OVER ALL EXCELLENT (in Mr. Burns voice off the Simpson's) the package came LITERALLY in one week. Bought it on 23rd thurs. got it 29th Friday
-1,I needed this to use my cellphone as a GPS on my bike which was already wired for the micro USB and the phone has the mini.  I wanted it tucked in so it wouldn't be sticking out asking to be bent and damage the phone.<br />They appear to be well made but the left plug is apparently missing the power wires so it won't charge the device it's plugged into.  I ordered a replacement thinking it was a fluke but in fact they both show the same flaw.
1,Very good price.  Has excellent touch response and very clear.
1,"The Tronfy functions exactly as it's supposed to. The music quality may<br />not be the best, but for the cost of the<br />device, it just can't be beat."
1,Very good
1,"Love the variety in color, I can use a different color for each day of the week!"
1,Incredible case.
0,"on april 22, 2014 i purchased 3 of these items [via ebay]<br />1 is still working fine, i rarely use it.<br />2 of them just broke this month after a little over of 1 yr use:<br />-one of which i plug in and out often in the 12V cig lighter, the silver metal tabs on the outside of the unit broke. i was unable to fix it after opening. i find the design of those a little weak.<br />-the other i've kept in a car almost permanently. nothing looks damaged from the outside. so it's probably something internal.<br />i only use these to charge a Samsung galaxy 4 smartphone.  obviously for $9 bucks i can't really conplain.<br /> used it to charge a Samsung smartphone<br />Customer service of this company is great. Rma return process was fast and easy. They replaced the broke ones"
-1,Great idea and design but the sticky pad doesn't support the weight of an iphone6 plus and keeps falling off
1,I REALLY like these headphones. Crisp music for my workouts
1,"does the job, took it water rafting. Fits fire phone."
1,Love these cords - quick charge - long and convenient - I have ordered more since the first order.
-1,These headphones are uncomfortable in my ear the right one actually hurts  like hard plastic. They fall out of my ears frequently. Bluetooth connection occassionally cuts in and out but my biggest complaint is the battery life. It runs out of juice after just over two hours. I cant get thru two 75 minute workouts before the battery dies.
1,I really enjoy my mini kick stand I call it. It helps me not hold my phone in my hand all the time. And I can charge my phone without just laying flat or propped up against something. It is a great buy and product. Thanks. And they came securedly wrapped and I was happy opening the boxes.
1,"Very solid charger, not a touch and go product like a lot of them out there.  Received an excellent discount for an honest review.  Thank you!"
0,Product is as expected except for the color.  I ordered orange and instead of the darker shade pictured I received a much lighter shade of orange.  My daughter called it pink.
1,Nice phone for the money
1,Well worth the money and easy to use!!
1,Product works great charging two devices
1,"This is a great phone.  Good Camera, great specs, works great, never had any problems.  I really like the Windows phone operating system, and this was about the best Windows phone you could get at the time for T-Mobile.  I got another one, used, for my daughter, and it works great, as well.  Nice design, too, and decent screen.  Fast.  I do wish it had an SD card slot, but I never ran into a space problem."
1,I received this product free in exchange for a honest review. The case comes in a little plastic baggy. The case doesn't make your phone that much thicker or heavier at all! This case is definitely going to protect your phone. Everything fits perfect and snug. The buttons function properly and this plastic case is not made cheaply it really is durable! Fits my Galaxy s5 spot on! Would definitely recommend!
1,Love the wireless transmission after years of wired setups.
1,just a great case.
1,Fast delivery and totally satisfied with product
1,Met it's purpose
-1,This thing is hard to use (when compared to Google Maps). And it has routed me to a low bridge.
1,Would've been a 5 star but the Oder when u open the package is TOOOOOO strong 😣 other than that.. I love it!
1,perfect
-1,It never stayed more than30 seconds on my phone.  The case was never used because of that.  And the others that I purchased did the same.
1,This one seemed like it might be the perfect &#34;fit&#34; for me.
1,Works great. Thanks for the prompt shipment
-1,Got these about a month ago and now none of them work. Not worth the money.
1,Very happy with it
1,"Looks Great, fits right, works fine"
1,"***IMPORTANT: DOES NOT COVER THE ENTIRE SCREEN***<br /><br />Last swell Monday morning, I started the work week off by dropping my beloved Nexus 5 on the tile floor, and DESTROYED the screen.<br /><br />Groggy, unhappy, ordered a Nexus 6, my favorite case, and saw this tempered glass for sale for cheap on Amazon. Lots of reviews, didn't bother to read any of them (hindsight 20/20 this was my real mistake). I glanced over the notes and read that the screen cover did not go over the entire screen. Didn't read it fully, figured well ya, duh, cause if it did all the bumber cases would peel it?<br /><br />Fast forward a week, received the screen cover, and immediately thought they sent the wrong one. It doesn't cover a LOT of the edges. Went to the order page, and of course, this is supposed to be this way. I didn't knock stars off since it's my fault I didn't read. Initial impressions is this thing is very flimsy, I didn't even think it was glass, since I've never seen glass bend the way this does. Time will tell if it's any good. If I did it all over again I would get a regular screen protector so it covers more of the phone."
1,Fits perfect! Love this case!
-1,Won't stay clipped on the vent. Dislike
1,I LOVE this case. It shows of my beautiful white Note 5 while still providing some protection. I'll be back if I need another one!
1,Not that snug on the ears but otherwise perfect
1,My boyfriend never uses a case for his phone but loves to use this one for obvious reasons. But deff a purchase to make if you want it for the same obvious reasons aha
1,I was wondering if 3knights sold just the holsters to this case I broke the holsrwr
0,It's a good case but I wasn't expecting it to be so bulky and big. Also it's super heavy
-1,Didn't even fit my iPhone. Really cheap material.
1,Good product and customer service
1,awesome product at a competitive price!
1,works as promised
-1,It didn't work at all with my nose sound dock
1,"What a great armband. Well-made with nice solid stitching and a Velcro closure, once on, will not come loose thanks to the two slots that allow for tightness or looseness. It’s also comfortable without causing chafing. The key slot is a nice touch but even better is the cut out for the camera, which allows you to take a photo without having to pull the device out of the pouch. The only thing is that you’ll need to remove any other cases from the phone for it to fit so depending on the type of case you have, that may be easy or not easy.<br /><br />Overall, a very good sports arm band that will surely last a good long time.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion."
1,I was sent the wrong size pouch.  I am looking forward to having the right size case.  It's just what I need to carry the charger and it's cables.
1,Life saver!  I rely on my phone heavily 24/7 and it's nice to have this little gem to save me from going &#34;dead&#34;.
1,"In direct sunlight, the 8W version allowed my phone's battery to gain charge while streaming 4G video with the screen at full brightness. What more could you ask for?"
1,The only device that was able to hold properly my Nokia Lumia Icon phone.
-1,What a piece of garbage. I've never owned anything where the suction cup fails when adhered to clean glass faithfully every five minutes...the fail rate was the most reliable part of the unit.
1,"I kept my old 3GS and decided to let my (then) 3-year-old play with it because I was tired of my phone being taken from me. As most 3 year olds are, she was rough on it, and I just knew it was going to break. Since the phone is so old, I doubted I'd find a good case, but was very pleasantly surprised to find this one. It has saved it from damage and has the added bonus of being a color in which my daughter delights. The only issue is that I can't use the docking station to charge it anymore because of the thickness of the case... but the wall charger works just fine."
1,Luv it!
1,Works
1,Holding up very well.
-1,"Started to come apart, separate shortly after putting on phone. silicone sides was coming apart from clear backing"
1,"I drop my phone so often that that alone is enough to make this case worth every penny. I also make body products, love to cook, and love the outdoors. In every scenario I have spilled something on it, or it starts raining, or whatever. You don't have to stress about your phone getting jacked up. I had one of these on my iPhone 4s for 3 years with tons of wear before the rubber started to come apart, so I bought one when I got my new phone!"
1,Good product .
1,Work's great. Just as good as my old one.
1,"ship fast, good product and original"
1,"I do not normally review products and I can never seem to be happy with a case but this case is AWESOME! Very thin and minimal but protects well, has the buttons built into the case, and the clear back shows off the phone well. For $10 you can't go wrong."
1,It's a good case but it's hard to take off
1,Looks Great and works like it is suppose too. Great value for the price!
1,"Satisfied with the product, it was up to my satisfaction."
1,As promised
0,"I put one of these shields on my phone the other day, it was easy to put on but, when I went to pull the #2 tag off the shield it only came half way off so I had to take a Q-tip with some cleaner on it to slowly wipe off the excess glue.  I am hoping that the rest of them are not like this."
1,very good..fits well
1,"I like the product very much. Having four sub ports and three outlet plugs is very convent when traveling. The bad is the USB ports require have a power button that spins a fan, which hums and annoys my spouse."
1,Looks great. Great cover for the price.
1,Works really well and very happy with purchase! Excellent value for the money.
1,"I use this on my note 4 and my s6 edge plus and it works just like the factory charger.  I bought 2 of them, one for each vehicle. Awesome product. Would recommend for anyone that has a phone that can utilize the quick charge 2.0."
1,"When was the last time someone said to you, &#34;I like your phone case, where did you get that?&#34; Cases allow you to say something about yourself the same way a t-shirt or a hair cut can be an extension of your personality. If you grew up with Legos or know someone who did and still finds themselves starring down the Lego aisle at a store, this is a MUST HAVE! The only negative I can say about this product is that there are limited color options. The bottom cut out also provides plenty of corner protection without interfering with headphones/speakers/port. Fits 5S perfect right out the box."
0,I needed something just a bit louder for outdoor use but inside it does a great job. Inside a room with 20 people holding conversations you can hear the music clearly in every part of the room. But I use this speaker for Type and Speak and outside it is easily drowned out by traffic passing on the city streets.
1,I tried the quick charge on my tablet an it work great. It gave me the extra boost that I needed.
1,"Exactly what I was looking for in a TPU case. Sleek, elegant, thin, light, and all without sacrificing protection. I hate bulky cases, but I also hate broken, chipped, or cracked glass. It is hard as heck to find a case that is thin and light that offers any real protection. They're usually too bulky in all the wrong places, and sometimes not enough in the important places. This one is a real nice balance. Would buy it again in a heartbeat."
1,I love them and the fit is perfect. They were just what I was looking for.
1,Excelente
1,Great product...and comes in 6-pak!
1,"[[VIDEOID:b7d131804a5e4e6b5b74a31bbe162e3]] For the money, this dash cam is fairly decent. What I like about it is the compact size and high quality HD video. Check out the video posted with this review for actual footage taken with this cam. I was getting my car worked on at the auto shop, and it didn't occur to me until afterward that keeping tabs on what mechanics are doing with my car is a great application for this cam. I was watching the footage and wondering... when did I speed down the road like that, then run a stop sign while pulling a U-Turn??? Nope, my memory wasn't failing me, it was actually that dang mechanic driving my car like a jerk. So needless to say, I'm loving the auto record feature on this thing. I like that I can set how many minutes each clip should be, from 1 - 5 minutes each. The cam just keeps recording in these pre-measured increments, while continually deleting the oldest files. So the no-brainer, fully automated functionality is truly a bonus.<br /><br />Now for the stuff I don't like....<br /><br />The camera has a locking mechanism that attaches it to the suction cup windshield mount, aaaaand it really sucks. Every time I touch the cam to use any onscreen functions, or make a minor angle adjustment to the cam itself, it pops off of the base entirely. The suction cup sticks just fine, but the cam just falls off the mount waaaay too easily. The next quibble, is the user manual is terribly written. There's lots of sentence errors and jumbled words and confusion that just obfuscates more than it illuminates. The thing needs a serious rewrite, plus, some of the features aren't even mentioned, so I have no clue what some of it even does. Such as, parking monitor... um, okay, what's that? No clue. Sure, I could investigate, but why not just tell me outright?<br /><br />One saving grace, is the cigarette lighter power cable is nice and long. I was easily able to run a wired connection from my windshield mount, all the way to my center console where it plugs into. Cool. Then, after thoroughly testing it, I decided to pull the whole thing out in favor of a better dash cam that will be going up front instead. This one uses a mini USB connection, while the other uses a micro USB, hence the whole wiring had to come out. This one may get relegated to the back window; not sure yet. Oh, it's also worth mentioning that even though the screen is square, the video is indeed 16x9. The added screen space is for icons and onscreen feedback, which is actually a nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good economy dash cam, but there's better to be had.  I was given this free in exchange for an honest review.Cool.

1,"This is a fantastic screen protector for my Galaxy S4! The screen broke on my phone a couple of weeks ago which made my old screen protector start to peel up from all the glass. So I took the old protector off, cleaned up the glass a little, and bought this new protector to put back on over the break. This screen protector comes with everything you need to get the protector sealed perfectly to your phone. It has the screen wipes, anti static clean sheets, etc. All the prep materials worked perfectly to clean and clear up my screen to get it ready for the protector. The protector was very easy to apply, and I love how I just had to set it in place and it attached quickly on it's own leaving only a few areas for me to smooth down. There isn't a perfect seal around the part of my screen that's the most damaged, but I wouldn't expect there to be, and it is staying on much better than my old one was. I love how thick the screen protector is as well! It's really a great quality screen protector and I am very happy with it. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
-1,Can hardly hear the ringer and you can't change ringtones without purchasing a new one and the buttons are so small that big fingers hit more than one at a time.
1,"I've received my armor mine speaker. I like it. It seems to have a pretty good battery life and the sound is good for the size. It seems durable although I haven't really put it to the test.<br /><br />One suggestion, when I increase the volume, when it reaches its max, if you press the volume button again the music goes silent and it beeps at you, after beeping the music starts again. Still this is annoying and unnecessary. I also didn't see much of an indication of wether or not it was fully charged as the light never changed. So I charged it for a couple hours and the battery lasted days.<br /><br />It's a cool invention, and the price is great"
1,Great kit for camera repair.  Super easy to use and high quality.  I had my camera lens fixed in just a few minutes.
1,Love the feel of the case and super cute on my phone!
1,"This really is a wonderful stand for your watch and phone. This stand makes it easy to charge both your Apple Watch and your iPhone and it looks beautiful as well. I don't have an iPhone, I have a droid watch and phone but this stand still works beautifully for them as well! It's made of sustainable bamboo, so it's not endangering the rainforest or any trees. It is functional and beautiful!"
1,Excellent charger. Great price. Charges both my fire phone and my kindle.
-1,Cheap material. I would not buy again.
1,"There are pluses and minuses.  For the price, it's good.  I can hear music using this headset very well, from my phone.  It's comfortable to wear, and easy to operate. The downside is that people who call me complain that my voice is muffled.  I can hear them well, but they don't hear me well."
1,"Fits the phone perfectly. Sleek; not bulky. Great for price.  Negatives: one side was warped at arrival, and it is hard to push buttons on side if you don't have fingernails."
1,Works as advertised for my Nexus 6.
1,Good quality product.Nice color.
-1,"Seems like a good sturdy case. Tested it for waterproofing and looks good. The problem is that the screen cover is plastic with a dotted grid pattern on it (I assume for transmitting touch).  The plastic doesn't fit tightly, so there are bubbles (more like high and low areas) and not every place you touch is recognized. For me, it's the space bar area, so that's supper annoying. I have to press super hard for it to recognize. The dots are not too noticeable when inside, but if you're in direct sunlight, the grid is overlaid on everything and the plastic has a dulling effect on the screen, so everything looks dingy and terrible. Inside, the screen causes a rainbow effect like you'd see in an oily puddle on a street after a rain. I want to protect my phone, but at what cost? In this case a severe reduction of screen resolution and of texting ability."
-1,"the headphones work well, sound is decent.  Headband broke after two months of use."
-1,Took only a few flicks of the volume button for rubber to break. Also the white gets dirty very quick and it's hard to clean. The headphone port requires you to have a straight thin plug like the original headphones that come with the iPhone. Other wise it requires you to screw in an extra cord every time you want to use headphones. Works pretty well as a plain case if you don't mind the rubber breaking and it not being waterproof anymore but odds are if you are getting this product you want it for its waterproof capabilities.
1,Great product for working and my morning runs. Awesome!!!!
1,"Although I was really nervous about how well the whole thing would turn out, I have to say that it was really simple and worked flawlessly. The screen feels so real, almost as though it didn't have a protector on it."
1,This cellphone is my best decision. I was comparing for a long time to select it and now I'm very happy for my decision
1,Loved this otterbox! Dropped it so many times and phone was in perfect condition. Only bad thing is that it got dirty so quick and it's hard to clean.
1,Worked as advertised. Need to charge an iPad while on holiday and did not disappoint.
1,Snelle levering klasse
1,Great
1,Love it works better than i thought that it would great product amazon had it to me in 2 day which was amazing the sticky pad mounted to my dash and has not moved since i put it there all around great product
-1,"I debated with myself on whether I should do a 3 star review or a 1 star review, settling on 2 stars.  This phone is essentially great. It arrived in great condition, everything works and with an octa core, great sound, a nice design similar to the Galaxy S5, this phone seems like a great deal at 1/5 the price of the S5. There's only one flaw,  but it's so horrid that or makes this purchase not worth it.  It's 16 GB (or maybe 8?) with my own 32 GB micro SD and only 1 GB can be used for applications on your phone.  This is not enough for the apps you need, much less all your favorite apps. A lot of apps require being on your internal memory and you can't change how much of your internal memory you use for apps, unless you wanted to root your phone with a CHANCE of it working.  I returned it promptly and just got a Galaxy S5. The phones are close to the same size,  but due to slight differences, an S5 case will not work well with this phone."
1,The cover is a perfect fit .
1,10 ft is great. the  braided cord is good. charges faster than what we had.
1,I bought this as a gift for my sister. Its affordable and its just a great buy. It comes with the button to take the picture so you dont have to put a timer on the camera. It fits almost every phone as well with the adjustable grasp. It extends long enough to take a group picture as well. I know my sister loved it and shes selfie-ing away!
1,"Great product. Works exactly as it's supposed to. Even comes with a warranty, which is nice. No complaints!"
-1,"The wi-fi is grayed out and will not reset. I am not able to use wi-if whatsoever, therefore I have gone above my data allowance on my cell plan, costing me even more money. The apps continuously &#34;glitch&#34; out and will not stay up on my screen to use. The phone randomly &#34;pixelizes&#34; if you will, fades out, the phone then freezes for a couple of minutes, then the phone shuts itself off. I can not turn it back on for a few minutes, which has been a problem as I had been using it atbthe time. Please note, the phone did not have any other apps running at the time and was not hot or overheated when this happened. I realize this is an older phone model, however I still expect it to work properly as advertised when I bought it."
1,Love it
0,Screen saver came off in just a few days.
1,Actually this is the 2nd anklet I buy .... the first 1 I bought I had for a couple months and now it will not charge ... i didn't know an kernel offered an 18 warranty so I purchased a new 1 ... im hoping you could fix the first 1 I purchased from you ....
1,Great thanks!
1,"I've used a few cases for my galaxy note 3 but i've never tried a soft rubber case that felt as quality as this. the rubber is fairly dense and can stand up to a fair amount of abuse, specifically concrete. i've dropped my phone many times on concrete with this case and neither the phone nor the case received any noticeable damage. Another feature i really enjoy about this case is its ability to keep cool on the outside. my biggest issue with the note 3 is its tendency to heat up during extended periods of use, this case keeps the phone at a fairly cool external temperature making it very comfortable and pleasant to operate. The overall feel is good, the rubber feels dense, if i had to compare it to compare the rubber to anything id have to say it feels like a car tire, and high quality. If you like soft cases and want good protection for your phone this case is a definite candidate."
1,Perfectly clear... fit beautifully on 6th gen iPod.  Letting the Gold Shine On!!  :0)
-1,This is literally a photocopy of this case. It's not glittery or sparkly.  Do not waste your money because you have to pay for shipping there and back to return.
1,"Haven't tested it in the &#34;wild&#34; yet but after the test I put it through I'm 100% sure it'll hold up.<br /><br />Filled it with paper and held it down with weights underwater overnight. (Weights were necessary since it floats, which is another huge plus)<br />Next morning opened it up and confirmed it's totally waterproof. It's not exactly pretty but it's a bag so, whatever."
1,Super protective 5 stars well deserved
-1,Worked good but stopped working after 3 weeks
1,good all around
1,Bought this for my husband he loves it and it really does protect your phone- I got one from my daughter for Christmas last year and love it really protects my phone I have a tendency to drop it now and again- no damage so far- knock on wood
1,Great!
1,"Very good, not cheap material. Better music quality than my previous ones off of amazon."
1,good product
-1,After 2 months stop to work!
1,Cover phone nicely.
1,Works well with Samsung galaxy S5.
1,excellent!
-1,"It was wrong cases, I ordered white and black but I got black and pink ,now I can't use it."
1,Fast delivery by seller and excellent product. Works great and easy to adjust.
1,It's a great phone case! It protects your phone and has an amazing fit. Thank you for the fast shipping 😘😘
1,Lots of fun.  I get comments on this cover all the time.
1,"I'm absolutely amazed that somebody figured out an intelligent and reliable way to apply screen protection to a smartphone. I have two S6 Edge+ phones, and I applied this protector on each one of them right before I went to bed. Zero bubbles and much fewer issues than any other protector I've used. Wraps perfectly around the edge and feels pretty good. Not as smooth as the ultra smooth glass on the Edge+, but definitely very high quality."
1,Awesome
0,Not bad
1,Perfect
1,"I love the flexibility of this device to both charge cars and various electronic devices.<br />I have not needed to use it for my car as yet,<br />but will update as and when this is needed."
1,Very  good.
1,Cool
1,I love it and it came in the mail fast and I was just so happy an d yes it was amazing
1,It's great but it blocks out your voice fir people to hear. That's the only downside
1,Does what it's intended to do: kkep the Nuvi charged
1,Phone was shipped in a timely manner.  Looks brand new and works like a champ!  Very happy with this item!
1,BUY NOW !!
1,"I am forever forgetting to charge my cell phone, and nw, no matter were I am, I can charge it..  Stays charged for more time then all the others I checked out....  thanks."
1,I love this case!!  I had the bigger Otterbox case and it was too bulky for my taste but this is perfect.  It has even taken a tumble down a flight of stairs and there is only a scratch on the phone case and my iPhone had no damage.  Will be purchasing more.
1,"It works! That's really all there is to say. Still functioning as of August 30, 2015."
1,I am Very pleased with this product. It even enhanced that look of the screen. ☺️
1,It is an awsome product. Protect your iPhone well and the material feels great.
-1,I ordered the galaxy design and received a rustic American flag design.
1,"Holds 2 credit cards and 1 driver's license. At first I was skeptical about it's ability to hold these 3 items without them slipping out, but they do stay in the holder. Sometimes it is hard to get one of my credit cards out, but that's a good thing. The back does scratch easily, but I don't view that as a problem or a defect. It is a natural part of wear-and-tear from my perspective. And it's purely cosmetic."
1,Worth the money
1,By far the EASIEST screen protector to put on! It comes with everything--the wet wipe and microfiber cloth AND sticker duster helps make adhesion easy and quick with NO bubbles. Protects the screen and still makes it easy to swipe and touch as if nothing were on it at all.
1,"Best phone case I've ever owned, and classy. Only problem is the little band is made out of the same stuff as hair ties, and my band has entered the final stages of it's life. I recommend the magnetic one instead (Search for magnetic genuine oiled leather case for nexus 6)"
1,I bought this for my husband and he loves it.
1,"Love it. It works perfectly fine. the phone tilts to the side a little bit and if the phone case is too heavy then it will fall, but otherwise it works fine."
1,"Love the look, the feel, the sturdiness. This color combo is really sleek and unique."
-1,Phone was delivered  on July 17th and worked fine and the phone screen started going black 08-30-15 and is continuing to go black and the last day to return the phone was 08-17-15 so now I'm stuck with it.
0,"Haven't used them yet, but they use AA batteries, NOT AAA. Make sure we buy the correct one."
1,Love it! I'm
1,I love having this power charger!  Does a great job charging my Droid turbo !
1,"The only thing I can review at the moment is that the case looks as described. I only plan on using it during the 4th of July.  I do wish it had a snap on front to protect better, my bad for not reading description better as the one I had originally seen was front and back."
1,Great deal
1,"Works great! I put it on my night stand for convenience.. let the phone sit on it over night, wake up to a fully charged phone.<br /><br />Works as it should."
1,Love this case!
-1,Yeah it broke so this sucks
1,"It came in a timely manner, and is durable, but is a little hard to get off your phone once you put it on. Also, the picture is starting to peel off already, but it is serving it's purpose."
1,Worked great for my LG G3 screen replacement. No complaints at all.
-1,ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! Constantly breaks and comes apart. Absolutely no protection for the phone at all!
-1,Didn't care for it so much. I think any case ruins the aesthetic of the phone itself.
-1,this was the worst purchase I have made with Amazon yet.  it worked for one charge and that was it.
1,protects the phone against the hardiest/toughest of tests.  brutal ownership by teenage boys is not enough to thwart the magnificant protection of this beautiful and functional case.
-1,Complete garbage!! Can't someone make a screen protector without having to spray some liquid on it and make it look like crap?? Waste of $$
1,great cables with fast delivery and a solid guarantee.
-1,Charging space is way to small and overheats if you are able to find that sweet spot and actually get your pho e to charge.
0,Diameter is smaller than my cigarette lighter receptacle so you must be creative to ensure it stays plugged in.
1,"Screen protector is very different, but other than that it fits perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy s6 edge. I love how it protects the edges too."
1,This product does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well. I had previously lost a supposedly &#34;waterproof&#34; phone to water damage and wanted something that would offer more reliable protection as a 2nd line of defense. This product is really easy to use and as far as I can tell it is really waterproof under normal conditions like kayaking and swimming pools and whatnot. The lanyard can be helpful when you need your hands free or want to be extra sure you won't drop it. The clips that hold the case shut are easy enough to open but difficult enough that it can't readily open by accident. The plastic is clear enough that you can take decent pictures through it though it may fog up in cold water depending on the conditions.
1,"The screen cover was very well-packaged, had all the items in the box needed to do a good job, had clear instructions, was simple and easy to install, and so far is working very well."
1,Very clear plastic. Seems to be a quality product. Fits well and offers added protection without the bulk of some phone cases.
1,Battery last for a loooong time.
1,This was a gift and the person loved it.
1,"Perfect! I bought this as a birthday present and she loved it! Fits perfect, looks good!"
0,The Soundpeats are great for listening to music when you're running or working out.  But when you're talking on the phone they pick up all the background noise and it's sometimes hard to hear or understand what they are saying.
1,nice phone
0,"It was fine after I received it...I was very happy.  However, after a small amount of time.  it started to show wear.  The case is brown and it shows through PINK.  I wouldn't care if it was to look like an old book, possibly black to show through...but I cannot stand the pink.  Around the corners and along the back of the case."
1,"Awesome case,  just as good if not better then otter box."
1,can't go wrong with these.
1,Cute design and sturdy!
-1,The strapping broke after limited use. Junky.
-1,Quality wasn't as good as I expected
-1,The edge part of the screen protector kept peeling up after only a week.
-1,It had good reviews so I bought it.  I've tried to tighten it hard but it won't stay upright.  Little bumps make it move and I certainly can't use it on a mountain bike.
1,Works perfectly
-1,Not full coverage
0,"Bought this case about 2 weeks ago and everything was perdect until now, the charger port cover is now extremely loose because one of the little pieces has broken and the other one is about to break. Loved it but now I have to look for another one."
1,I was very impressed when I received this product but disappointed that it wouldn't work with my apple watch. This design requires the watch to lay flat. My Milanese Loop does not. When I ordered it that issue was unknown and I contacted the suppliers and they were very professional and concerned that they were unaware of that issue at that time.  I had received it at a discounted price for an honest review. My honest thoughts are I would have been happy with this product. It's light weight. It's sturdy. It does not look or feel cheap. It has a layer of glue or what feels like the post its glue sticky in the battery hole to help it adhere to the product and stay in place. It's really a thoughtful design. I just wish it had worked for me.
1,Works as expected. Unfortunately the metal clip may give your skin a rash if you are allergic to certain alloys. Even with that I can't complain at the price.
-1,otter box  said it is a fake......will not warranty this
1,"Great case, I accidentally ordered this one, but needed the 6 not the 6 plus. my exchange was quick and easy."
1,"I had a problem with the holster where the end broke shortly after I purchased the product. I notified the seller and they were very professional. They replaced the holster with no additional charges. I do recommend that any individual purchasing this product to be cautious with the holster. If the phone is not attached, the ends of the hoster can catch on to the ends of desks, chairs, etc when you stand from a seated position. Other that that, I am fairly satisfied with the product, and my purchase experience with the seller."
1,This is fantastic.  Tunes in the shower are the best.
-1,"This is actually worse than the battery it was ordered to replace.  From some back of the napkin calculations, I'd guess this has ~60% of the capacity that it claims. I would not recommend."
1,Nice.
-1,This product does not not function properly.<br />https://youtu.be/AoBPZm8xcys
1,"I bought this AC charger because it is UL listed.  A UL listing means that the design and manufacture both meet safety standards for protection against shock or fire.  If your adapter is not UL listed it could shock you or damage your phone/ipad/mp3 player.  A listed product has a UL file number printed on it. Verify the listing by looking it up on the UL website.  Listing by CSA, TUV, VDE, or ETL are just as good as UL.  Unfortunately, a CE mark means nothing as far as safety. BTW, this charger works great !"
-1,Still doesn't hold a chage. Changing was easy but take your time.
1,"This is a pretty standard aftermarket third party Apple-Certified MFI Lightning cable for iPhone 5/6 and newer iPads.<br /><br />This is 1 meter long (3.2 feet approximately), the same as the factory Apple cables. I have this in Yellow color.<br /><br />Plugs on both ends feel secure. This has worked fine with each of my various Apple products, with no issues. It's also worked with both my car charger and wall chargers.<br /><br />The MFI plug on this is relatively small, like the original Apple plugs, so I haven't had any difficulty getting it to fit into my various iPhone case port openings. That's convenient.<br /><br />Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. This just works, and works fine. Seems well made. No complaints.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop around. Happy travels, everybody."
1,I love my California case it's cute and fits my phone perfectly! Thank you!!
0,"works good but you have to have the space for it to sit, could not use it in my 2014 ford van nor my 2007 explorer"
1,Works just like the original one that came with the nook.  Great price.
1,I love it.
-1,I like the look and feel of the case. The only reason for the two star rating was the camera flash halo. Once you place the phone in the frame there is a distance between the frame and the case. This small space creates a shadow (halo) when using the flash for pictures. It renders this case useless when taking flash pictures. I ended up having to cut a small piece of the case off so the halo could be eliminated. I only did so because I do like the case. I'd save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere for a case.
1,I prefer this band over the Misfit branded one. The Shine slides in through the back and it's more secure. Versus the Misfit band where the Shine constantly pops out all the time!<br /><br />Only thing that bothers me is that the buckle is silver and not gold like the face ring. The black straps also have a tiny 'M' pattern on it. Overall good quality and I know I won't lose my Shine!
1,"I don't know if this is the best case you can get, but it's got my view for the best bang for the buck.  This is my 2nd Jetech case (also had one for the Note 3) and I've been very satisfied with them.  I tried to save a few bucks by buying a no name import off eBay and it wasn't nearly as thick as and didn't fully protect the edges like the Jetech.  Won't stray again."
-1,Disappointed because it didn't last two charges
1,This is by FAR the best charger i have ever purchased. it feels and is very sturdy. and i love how fast it charges my iphone. 5 Stars no doubt.
1,It's so good I like it
-1,It doesn't hold a charge for more than 4 hours.  Very disappointed.
1,exelente
1,Nice case but not enough protection for someone with my record of drops and flings. The paisleys are very pretty...makes my white phone look Lacey.
1,"The IPhone is great with some wear in the backside, but working as new"
-1,Case was warped and wouldn't stay on the phone
1,Great case great price
1,Great product
1,"Great case, for the price I love it. My son has dropped it several times and my phone has not gotten any scratches on it"
1,"Have bought other packs of cables for cheap prices like this, even braided ones, but they all crap out and transfer quality sucks. These cables are totally fine, good quality, works well.  Have yet to have any of them stop working or anything."
1,Best ever.
1,eye catching and cute
1,GREAT FIT!! GREAT QUALITY!! GREAT PRICE!!.. THE CASE CAME IN SOONER THAN EXPECTED TOO:)
1,I ordered 4 cases for our summer family vacation. Each case worked GREAT!
-1,I'm not too happy with this case...its mad slippery...the back feels a sticker on cardboard. When I put the phone in the gummy part of the case does not sorround the case because of the hard shell...in a couple weeks I will put my old case back on...this is garbage.
0,Very good one a really like!!!!
1,"Took a minute to get used to it, but it works very well.  I have played three rounds since it has arrived.  Shot 89 and 82 respectively.  Very accurate and it has seems to have all of my local clubs downloaded.  Would make a great gift for the avid golfer."
-1,"The seller is amazing, the product, not so mych, I bought 2, the 1st one was replaced immediately, still waiting on this one to be processed... Not a great tablet at all, I am thinking I'd rather have my money back rather than the replacement, but let's play it out and see how it goes...don't But this tablet if you want durability and longevity, neither of them lasted a week before they went out... Very dissappointed in these tablets"
1,everything was great.
1,Works well
1,Love it!!!
1,Great case!
1,nice
1,Fits perfectly on my phone
1,yes
-1,"It only work for 2 days, sent back and was able to receive my full return without any problems from the manufacturer"
1,It's clear. It was cut correctly. Good job makers of cut plastic thingy.
1,Excellent device for taking selfies on a selfie stick. The Bluetooth pairing is superb. Once paired to a device it can't be paired with another unless it's reset. This feature is good in a way since it always connects with the paired device instantly every time. I'm really happy I bought this after I've used the cheap Chinese makes which keep disconnecting all the time and add to the frustration. Just wish it came with a long around the neck sling...it's so small I'm afraid I might loose it. 😁
1,This is an exact OEM part to update my 2014 Ford F-150 Nav. system. It has the most up-to-date information available from Ford at this time for the in-dash map.  Simple & easy to change out the old SD card & replace it with the new SD card at less than half the price of the dealer price.
1,Well made cable - works exactly like I want it to.
1,Truly fit my device.  I was afraid that the size may be not right.
1,"can't even tell it's on the screen,great product"
1,really does work!
1,good product
-1,This is a terrible product. It does what it says but poorly. Anything played back thru it is nothing but static.
1,Very comfortable and convenient.
1,Works great
1,Seems to keep up with my ipad
1,My backup power is ready whenever I need it. I recharge my table twice while traveling with easy.
1,This is better mobile phone in this price
1,It is working as promised. My only complaint would be that the buttons aren't labeled (like flashlight and lighter). There are just 3 identical buttons in a row and I have to keep referencing the instructions if I don't use it often. But overall I'm very pleased.
1,"Great product, fits my cell in it's case, which will make it easier, and protect my phone better. Camp on time as promised."
0,"AlLittle snug, but alright."
1,Great price great quality.
1,great product Glad I got it on Amazon for cheaper!!
1,Clip is not very strong.  Otherwise the case is well made.
1,This item was purchased for a friend and he likes it. I wish the magnetic closure was more secure.
1,Good.
1,"The speaker is a little bit on the tinny side, but for the size and price of the radio one can't complain.  A couple of things I don't like about it is the default setting.  I bought it for the radio, and I have to hit the FM button after turning it on in order to get the radio to come on, and at this point often get blasted by sound or have to turn the volume up.  The volume control is too sensitive.  But all in all it does a great job."
-1,It worked great for the first month. Took it off yesterday and the protective film separated from the front frame...not satisfied with the product
0,"Was a bit let down.... this tends to look like a 3-D phone cover, but it is a flat &#34;picture like&#34; case.  It protected the phone when dropped and looks ok."
1,Love it!!!! Made my phone still look thin and classy!
-1,Very disappointed
1,"Great product overall, I loved everything about the kit with the exception that it cam with a dead pixel. Not super noticeable but none-the-less its still a bummer"
1,Works great out of the box.  Time will tell!
1,good phone<br />really good looking<br />...sometimes it gets really hot
1,Product as described.  Bluetooth hooks up to my cellphone for hands free driving.  This device actually attaches to the sun visor of your car.  So it is out of the way.  It is a little bit thick.
1,Happy with this purchase.
1,Came just as described. Use it all the time.
1,"I love it!!!! I can carry my credit cards, money and cell phone all in one wallet. It is so convenient!!! I don't carry my purse as much because this is less of a hassel. Very good purchase for the price! I recommend this wallet to everyone with a cell phone. The wallet is good for a man or women. You will love it!"
-1,Won't keep charge. Took a chance on generic and it backfired. Amazon prime purchase took 3 days to receive.
1,Such a lifesaver on trips and when I'm camping!!!
1,Buy a few. .they'll need to be changed every few months
-1,Connect and disconnect  continue
-1,This will not protect your phone if you drop it.
1,"very nice case, fits my nuvi65 very well, completely satisfied"
1,great product great price deliverd as promised
1,Great product. Very nice.
0,The wire just above the input gave out only a few weeks after having them.
1,great phone for such a low price.
1,"Got this for my Samsung S6.  Easy to install and hoping it does the job if I drop my phone.  However, the instructions within the packaging require a magnifying glass which is really annoying !!<br /> I agree with other posts that its easier to install it horizontal instead of vertical.  Within the instructions it tells you to put two red sticky tabs at either corner to help with alignment which was not useful at all.  This screen protector isn't that hard to put on the phone."
1,Great phone for the price
1,"Excellent item, great service"
1,"So far I've been very happy with this adapter.  I have used all of the different USB variants that this cable provides and have been very happy with it.  I've not tested the charge speed since typically I am just leaving the units overnight so I can't speak to that.  I assume that when you are charging multiple devices at the same time, the charge rate will decrease.<br /><br />About the only think I can complain about is the length of the adapter.  It is extremely short and so I had to buy a little 6&#34; or 1' extension just to get it from the plug to our counter top.  Would buy again!"
1,Perfect. Exactly as I ordered and expected.
1,Love this wireless charge for the phone. And works nice and fits great.
0,"The case looks great on. But after about a couple of weeks it started to crack. It also shows dirt terribly. Really get what you pay for on this one. HOWEVER, I have dropped my phone multiple times on many surfaces and it has not cracked."
-1,Broke after 2 weeks. The cord is still fine but the metallic top that goes around the male piece slides off. Bad glue
1,Great supplement to any Garmin bundle.  Price was better than I could find locally and it got to the house in a reasonable amount of time.
1,Clear and effective. I like them
1,Great product.
1,The best thing ever!
0,Looks perfect and fit well.  The trouble is the material it was mad with somehow negatively affected the reception of the phone.
1,"Using the Tough Claw together with a ball Diamond base, Garmin Nuvi Cradle, and double arm socket to mount GPS in a RZR UTV side by side.  System is very solid and offers a great range of adjustability.  Can mount to roll bar or on the passenger &#34;T&#34; bar and adjust so driver or passenger can see and operate the GPS."
1,"I was beguiled by the many positive reviews to believe that this was possible. I consider myself fairly handy with most things and have played around with electronics before. Having now destroyed one phone, I may be able to fix one in the future but I doubt I'd try again.  With great patience and care, I think that the LCD/Digitizer had cracked before I'd even begun to get the screen separated.  I'm sure this is a fantastic kit, but unless you have absolute confidence in your abilities and some experience, I'd recommend against this unless you are fully willing to trash the phone.  At the very least - back up anything you may want to say. Lulled into a false sense of security, I neglected to do so.  As of 9/8: Upon reflection, while my experience was far from successful, the kit itself was great. There were a multitude of tools for use and all of great quality. Further, the immediate response from the seller after I posted my review was amazing. While they aren't able to miraculously restore my phone, they have gone above and beyond all my expectations to make it as right as they can.  I would strongly recommend them as a seller.  And if you know what you are doing, then I can recommend this kit."
1,Super fast charging and it looks great.
1,I really loved the case. The case is almost addicting and I love the thickness of it. It holds really well on the phone.
-1,"I was very skeptical and used it this weekend to charge my phone, my wife's phone and friends phone.  (All iPhone 6). I went camping and in the beginning it charged my phone fine and fast however I would go back every once in awhile to check on it and it would stop charging even in direct sunlight and would say device is not supported.  I would have to keep unplugging and re-plugging it in to start charging again.  Later that day I tried charging my phone again and it stopped at 75% and wouldn't go beyond it for an hour in direct sunlight.  It looked like the panels were warping slightly.  I tried plugging my phone to my car and it's as if the unit did something to my iPhone where it froze from charging beyond the 75%!?.  I had to do a hard reset on the phone and luckily it started charging again.<br /><br />If I have to keep checking I it to see if it's charging and re-plugging it in to make it work leaves me with no confidence in a real world emergency situation.<br /><br />Sorry thought it was going to be great, but sending it back!"
1,"This thing is awesome. I really like it because I can display things on my T.V. without any software or wifi, etc. This works great for playing Netflix on my phone in Hotels.<br /><br />It is important to know however... for some reason, plugging your phone in and then going to the input doesn't register my phone. I thought it was broken or just not compatible at first. But, If you put your TV input on the HDMI first AND THEN plug in your phone, it comes right up. Don't know why, I just know that for my phone and TV it has to be done in this order."
1,"Phenomenal little set for the money. Has been used countless times in the short two weeks I have had it. A must have for anyone who tinkers or just owns cell phones, glasses, or smaller objects in general"
1,"This is nice, however, didn't fit everything and didn't organize it as well I was hoping. It's a well made product, and very reasonably priced. I was looking for a travel case that could organize all of my electronics, chargers, ear phones, etc. This fits my chargers and ear phones, but not all of the devices. I used to carry everything is Crown Royal bags, which I decided is not extremely professional at work, so this definitely a step up!"
1,Great...love it.
-1,"For shockproof, this is a great phone case, but the waterproof part does not work! I was so excited to get this case because with a 2 year old i never know where my phone could end up. My phone was in this case and my daughter through it into the toilet. It was ruined. I lost a 600 dollar phone because i trusted this phone case."
1,Love this!  So handy.
1,Everything was perfect!  Thanks
0,"Worked great, used for mud riding on my ATV with no issues. Got soaking wet multiple times, was covered in mud multiple times, just washed it off in the water.. Still able to use the cameras without issue, speakers sound good, does make incoming voice quality through top speaker worse but it's expected. S-Pen latch feels weak, and the stand on the back is hard to get out and feels cheap - BUT that's not a problem at all, for the price and protection quality it's great. 10/10 would buy again.  **UPDATE** I put it in an ice chest with a couple inches of water and within 30 minutes the case had filled with water. I did notice that the latch for the S-Pen had broken but still functioned. I believe this is why the case leaked. I didn't mean to leave it in the ice chest and my phone is okay so I'm not upset. I've noticed in other reviews that the S-Pen latch is faulty and breaks easily. I will just silicone it shut, I only intend on using this case on weekends when I know I'm going to be around water and rough with it."
1,worked great for vacation. didn't have to carry wallet and phone. Only minus is you can't carry more then a few dollar bills but if you're like me and mostly carry cards it is fine.
-1,"Right after delivery, I opened the product box and found there's some scratches touched up. Also, because the ear speaker sealing is put inside, sticking side can be seen from out side and it's looking bad. maybe because of those, it was quite big discount.<br />However, moreover such cosmetic issue, display response became so bad, it doesn't even my pass code to get in to iphone.<br />I need to press display very firmly but still hard to make it work so that it became too much stressful/annoying using iphone with this case; structure isn't bad but iphone display response became too bad to use. I decided to return this item."
1,"I wear it everyday and it really provides incentive to keep up the number of steps taken each day.  The sleep tracker is very interesting to analyze sleep patterns as well as give a little &#34;nudge&#34; to help you get your goal amount of sleep each night.  I do not use the food/calorie counting aspect as I find my diet too difficult to track due to erratic eating habits. The battery holds quite nicely for approximately two weeks.  This style is worn easily and without fear of losing it as happened to me with a new Fitbit that I had on for less than three hours - gone!  Unfortunately, however, I believe this style is being discontinued which, IMO, is a mistake on the part of Jawbone.  Get it while you can."
1,I recommend excellent product . All very good
1,Remember Matthew 7:21
1,Update:  Since my last review Amazon replaced my unit And the new unit is working like an Anker should. Am updating the rating because of both Amazon as well as Anker's stellar customer support.<br /><br />Well guess its my luck this baby will not take a full charge. Left it overnight still only 3 LED will light up and charging a phone will drop it down to two ....feeling a bit let down specially with my upcoming trip ...
1,LOVE these headphones - highly recommend!
1,exact replacement
0,The back clamp is quite fragile (it seems). Other than that very pleased with it.
1,Really like it.  Shipping was fast too
1,Really cute case.
1,Does the job.
1,I'm not comfortable with taking over a radio station someone might be listening to but then again at least it works lol
1,"This is a great case, it has a good snug fit on my phone without limiting access to anything  on the phone. All of the buttons are still functioning and the case doesn't block my camera. It was very easy to install on my device, it also came with instructions to help you out. It hasn't blocked any reception, I still hear crystal clear on my phone. I ordered a clear grey phone case because I like to keep things simple, but there is alot of other color choices to choose from. This Phone Case by COLLEN is a quality phone case.<br /><br />(I purchased this phone case at a discounted price in exchange for my fair, honest & unbiased review of the phone case after using it.)"
-1,"If you wear hearing aids, this device is worthless. Even with telecoil, the volume is lower than normal and it does not separate background noise, obviously. Can't speak for normal hearing users."
1,Amazing amount of items at a great price.
1,Good
-1,"I like the picture on it, but I wish it gave my phone a little more protection."
1,"Great product, easy to use."
1,Great for  the price.  Very happy with it
0,"This is adorable, but the rhinestones to do stay on the phone. I really like this phone case, but pretty soon it will be all silver.  The rhinestones started falling off the first day I put my phone in it."
1,Purchased this one for my son.  &#34;Most awesome phone case ever&#34; is his remark.
1,This phone works great and I have had no issues since buying it! The phone is in really good shape and the only thing wrong was some sticker residue. Glad I made this purchase!
1,"like most chargers online thye work for a while then break, but did its job for the meantime."
0,"It said it worked with my galaxy mega but it, didn't, but it worked with my Goddaughters Samsung Galaxy, so we just switched, she had a regular one, it worked well for her"
0,Works great but the bad side is that in sunlight you barely see anything on your screen. Also there is no cut out for the light sensor so you have to change the background light manually. Customer support was great though
1,Works great.
1,"Decent sound..easy to setup. Great sound (for a blue tooth earphone) the design is good for making sure the earphones stay in the ear during a work out, but usage does give you some fatigue (not the fit it forget it experience which I normally expect from ear phones)"
1,Love it!
1,just installed on my note5.  looks really good to me.  no issues thus far.  easy application.
1,works as advertised.  we power our mini iPads and iPhones and have not had a problem
1,Great product.
-1,"This product was advertised as flush mount, but it sticks out of my car lighter socket by over an inch.  It would have been nice to get actual product dimensions on the selling page, but the only dimensions were the packaging."
-1,"It cannot support the weight of an iPad mini like the photo shows.  This product is a lie.  it will hold a smart phone, but the arm is so weak is will slowly bend down like melting clay."
-1,Colors not nearly as vibrant as the pictures display.
-1,These preformed very terribly. Barely covers the screen company responded with responded with asking for photos and saying there was nothing wrong.. That's how the designed them.
1,Worked great
1,very good case
1,"I love these things.  Most companies will paint on the designs but these are clearly nylon wrapped and very sturdy.  I'm expecting big things from these cables as my wife is an absolute destroyer of cables.  I use to buy cheap cables because she would go through one every couple months but I'm done with that.  I would spend the extra money for these cables again and given that they come in a multi pack with different colors, there will be no more accusations of who took whose cable.  The connections are very stable and work great.  I was very happy with these cables and the length is perfect, much better than the regular 3' that come with most standard phones.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review."
1,I replaced a leather band with this strap and very happy.
-1,it broken when installing the cell phone. I need that I send a new one!!
1,"battery performs as needed, but it's not the Official Genuine battery. It does not match the battery that came with my phone, which was purchased new from a Verizon dealer."
1,"The phone came earlier than expected! Honesty, I don't know what else to say. I usually don't leave ratings or reviews, but this time it's worth it. Besides, the rating should speak for itself. GOMAB"
1,"Beautiful and functional ~ pockets are large enough for Galaxy Note 4, bluetooth, ID, cards, cash.  Very soft and flexible."
1,These are pretty awesome for how little they cost. They sound decent enough and the battery lasts quite a while. Totally worth it.
-1,"At first I loved this case, it was exactly what I was looking for.  It had a good fit and the kickstand worked perfectly.  After the first couple months, the thin plastic broke off above the volume buttons, no biggie.  6 months later, this case is like a 20 year old car in Arizona, the plastic is extremely brittle and new pieces seem to break off every time I use it.  No longer happy with my purchase."
1,I love it
1,I had an adapters similar to this one that I bought at Walmart; I had it for 3 months before I broke it out of frustration and anger. It did this annoying thing were it would continuously skip and create the most obnoxious noise. Ended up throwing it out of the window. So I had to buy another so I could still listen to music. This is a huge improvement! I've had it for 3 weeks and I am very happy with my purchase. It doesn't skip or make weird eerie noises. It also doesn't randomly eject when ever it feels like it. Has great audio. I would highly recommend it to anyone that has anger issues. Might be two bucks cheaper at Walmart but it'll save you a lot of frustration in the future.
-1,It didn't fit like it was suppose to
1,"So I was reluctant at first to get this phone.  Though I got the best deal and price for it from amazon.<br /><br />First, the screen is amazing! The edge to edge screen makes it a lot better than any scree. And with the edge, 5 phone callers can be assigned in different  colors.<br /><br />Second, I like the metal back,"
1,This case is actually true to the picture and is very cute 😃 one thing I really don't like is the ears
1,Great seller...products came as promised.
1,Good stand...and adjustable too!
-1,JUNK!!!!!!!
-1,"Phone keeps over heating and shutting off, even when not in use.  I know it was a refurbished phone but it obviously wasn't checked before sending out."
-1,"Seemed to work well for two days.  Then seemed to be intermittent.  Then stopped charging, although indicator lamp stayed on.  Lamp showed blue constantly once it stopped working."
-1,Not excited with this one.  It has a cheap rubber I feel to it and it slips off too easily...made a mistake in ordering this.
1,Good price & performs as stated. Using one right now on my iPad mini.
0,"The headphone jack was not cutout correctly. I also think the silicon grip (in the right corner) is beyond too close to the speaker cutout. I do love the matte shell though, gives it a velvet feel."
1,Great product
1,much thinner than i expected but still appears to be good protection for my phone.
1,These are an excellent set of Bluetooth earbuds. They're comfortable and sound is great! Thanks.
1,thank you
1,"Beautiful, powerfull and everything in nicely designed box. This is the best looking power bank I had. Express shipping. I can recommend it to anyone who's got bigger smartphone. I'm using Nexus 6 and it can be charged almost 5 times. My personal hero ;)"
1,Works perfect! Will buy another 1.
-1,It is too small for the above phone. It is very difficult to take the phone out
1,"This case is impressive. I purchased this for my dad's new phone, and he asked me to put it together for him. I watched the installation video to be safe, because when I first tried to take it apart, it was so resistant, I thought surely I was going about it all wrong. The video reassured me that I had been trying to take the case apart correctly, but the rubber piece is so sturdy that my dad had to get one corner off before I could seperate the rest. It comes in two pieces, the thick, durable rubber piece, and a plastic piece which includes the screen cover. It fit his S5 like a glove. The side buttons are covered by the rubber, but they are still easy to press. This surprised me, as other heavy covers have made it nearly impossible to use the buttons. The screen cover seemed very durable, without impeding the touch screen functions. It seems just as durable and protective as otterboxes I have owned, at a fraction of the cost. I will be buying one of these cases for my LG in the future."
1,"Excellent case, excellent service!"
1,"It is Ok, but I thought it will be better...the mirror is very, very useful but the stick...the way of open it and close it is not the best one..."
1,"THIS IS THE ONLY PHONE MOUNT THAT MATTERS.  SLEEK , STRONG and USEFUL.  Portrait or landscape.  All phone sizes.  Just stick the magnet on the back of your case (not the back of your phone) and  you're set.  A+"
1,Great quality product. Does not protect screen much but it a slim cover.
-1,The bag that was supposed to hold everything was broke when I received it not to mention one of the flowers was already broke as well.
1,"I bought this several months ago, still working great!!  I like the fact that both USB's are 2.1A."
-1,Charging connector did not work.  Broken on inside.  I could hear it rattling.
0,"A little on the flimsy side. When I received the mic,  the built in speaker was loose and rattling around in the plastic case. I had to disassemble the unit to fix the issue. Works fine otherwise."
1,"Really like this case, it does what it's supposed to do and has saved my phone a couple of times since I received it."
1,Gets the job done.
1,Very pleased with this case. My phone snaps in perfect and is held in securely. I use the fold out to display my phone on my desk at is works perfectly.
-1,"Not as good as original battery.  Does not retain charge all day, even with minimal usage."
1,"This handset is easy to use,  comfortable for holding with your shoulder or hand.  The earpiece of regular phones usually lets you hear yourself, which this doesn't,  but the sound quality is good otherwise."
1,Great product.
0,"This product doesn't seem to be working properly with my Kindle Fire.  It takes about 2 days for my power to reach 100%, I'm not very pleased with this product."
-1,Dont buy...
1,It works as expected.  Fast charging for my Notes 4 cellphone.
1,"Get it, it works, iPhones 5s"
1,"The Anker PowerCore 15600 is most definitely the best portable charger currently on the market. It is about the size of a stack of 2 iPhone 6+. It is quite light considering it's massive charging capacity. It has a smooth and flawless exterior, making it a very attractive product. The external battery comes in very simple packaging, and it comes with a Micro USB charging cable and travel pouch, both of which are extremely useful. The battery charges all of my devices as quickly or faster than charging from an electrical outlet. With two USB outlets, I am able to charge my iPhone and wireless earbuds simultaneously, efficiently, and conveniently on-the-go. Once I plug my devices into the PowerCore via USB cables, I don't have to worry if the devices are charging because the PowerCore recognizes that the devices are plugged and starts charging them automatically without me having to do anything. With other external batteries I have tried, such as New Trent's, I would sometimes forget to press the power button after plugging my devices in, resulting in my devices not charging while I assumed that they were. I am completely worry-free about charging my devices when using my Anker PowerCore 15600, in part because of the automatic charging, but also because of Anker's MultiProtect safety system which ensures my devices will never adversely be affected by the output of the external battery. I could not be more pleased with this product.<br /><br />I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest."
1,Strap is extremely comfortable. I only ever notice it when my breathing becomes very labored.<br /><br />I use this with a Garmin FR410 and so far haven't had any connectivity issues. Fun and informative to look at data when you're finished with a workout.<br /><br />Much more comfortable than the rigid plastic counter-parts.
-1,The overall looked the mount is good. Sleek and easy to use. Definitely holds my iPhone 6. The only problem is that it keeps falling off of my dashboard. Not sure why since the base is very sticky and I lock it in place.
1,very good quality
1,Fits perfectly. the kick stand comes in handy for videos.
-1,Hole for the camera is too small.  When you take night photos the flash bounces off the case and ruins the photo.<br />Chinese Junk.
1,nice band for apple watch and stylish
-1,I think it's very nice but poor quality. After having it only a few weeks and not even putting it in my pocket it's starting to fall apart!!! I'm not to happy about it
1,very good quality
0,"Ordered two iPhone 6 protectors, one was labeled for iPhone 6 but was for iPhone 5. The only plus was I my daughter has an iPhone 5 that I used it on. The other protector was the right size for my 6. So far it works fine."
1,"Absolutely amazing sounds. Very loud, very portable, very easy to setup and use. I have limited space in my apartment, so I bought this in order to use with my Audiotechnics record player connected to the analog connection and a Raspberry Pi Philco Radio Jukebox conversion that connects via optical cable. If I get really lazy, I just connect via bluetooth on my phone."
1,"exchange for a review, and my nephew has wanted one. We tried another type previously and weren't happy. This one feels really high quality and has worked without flaws. It's not flimsy. The telescoping extension works great. I'm super pleased with the plug and play feature. I do recommend this purchase."
1,"Fits my Note 5 perfectly. Yeah... It doesn't go all the way to the edge of the phone but like the description says, the screen on the phone rounds off so that's not really possible. In my opinion, the fit is perfect and the glass is super clear. I was able to install it within 5 minutes with no issues and I am very happy with the purchase."
0,"It does the trick and holds my iPhone6 tightly to my arm while exercising, but it was very frustrating trying to change my music or check my running app while in the armband. It seemed the sleep button was constantly hit from the pouch while attempting to navigate through my phone causing me to unlock it several times before I can do what I was intending to."
-1,Stopped charging my iphone 5s a month after purchase and I used them infrequently before that.
1,"Yes, this article meet my expectations"
1,"This thing holds my iphone 6 upright and effectively immobile in my 2014 Ford Escape.  The charging ports and 'cigarette lighter' port all work as advertised.  The spring release is reliable.  Granted, I've only had it a month but it gets used every day by my son and myself in this car.  You can't go wrong at this price."
1,Bad ass amp JL audio can't go wrong with them
1,great one i like it
1,The phone remains slim unlike other cases. It comes off easily when needed to replace the phone battery. Great case!
-1,"Despite the item description, this case does NOT hold an iPhone 6 Plus with an Otterbox Defender cover on it. Wasted my time. I paid for one-day delivery as I really needed it    Update: If you have an iPhone 6 plus with an Otterbox Defender case this one works great. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NTURFJ2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
1,EXCELENTE
-1,Such bad quality. Did not protect my phone when it fell. My phone shattered completely as well as this cover. Have to pay $150 to replace the screen
1,Great product!!!
0,It is ok
1,"Great quality case that looks great, too!"
1,Works great!
-1,"Fits amazing, looks amazing, but the back is a FINGER PRINT MAGNET. Which I can not stand. Might be returning."
1,"Sounds decent, battery is not the best, but it lasts a good few hours of talk time."
1,"Works great, fits snug!"
1,Excelent 100%
-1,"This phone has BIG issues with messaging.  At first, the phone is great for a cheaper smart phone, but after having it for a few months, I started having issues receiving and sending text messages.  I called AT&T customer care, and they took care of the problem, after a half an hour of being on the phone with them.  This same exact problem happened to me abut 4 times more, before I decided to use the warranty, and ask for a new phone.  Of course, I didn't get an updated phone from this, I got the same one, and I have also had the same problems with this phone. This phone would be better used as an iPod. Though, the music app downloaded onto the phone is very glitchy.  Needles to say, don't buy this phone unless you want a lot of problems."
1,Every thing fits great.
1,"This is a great deal for anyone who needs a spare phone for emergencies.  Or if you are a spy with not a lot of money, and you need a cheap &#34;burner phone&#34; to make calls without worrying if the NSA can track your location, the LG-305 is an excellent choice.  But, all kidding aside, I purchased this phone because I misplaced my Samsung S5, and since I was leaving for NYC in a couple of days, I didn't have time to look around the house for my cell phone.  The LG-305C is very small and I was able to purchase a small holster style case in Manhattan for $5.00  My only issue I have the phone is that a &#34;voice&#34; repeats every command I use for this phone.  Now if I really was a spy, that would be a dead give-away if I was hiding from my pursuers.  Other than that, the LG-305C is a great little phone and the &#34;Triple Minutes for Life&#34; an added bonus."
1,It works!
1,"I’ve been using stereo Bluetooth headsets for listening to the music in the gym ever since the first such device came out and the mp3 players started including Bluetooth as an option. In my opinion there is absolutely no other way to unobtrusively listen to the music while you exercise. However, all the headsets that I’ve used so far have one major problem: they all fail due to the moisture within a very short period of time. So far I have not had any such problems with these headphones, but only time will tell if they manage to be an exception to the rule.<br /><br />The sound quality of these headphones is one of their main attractions. First of all, no wireless headphones of this size will ever be able to deliver the deep, clear sound that you expect from some of the higher end headphones, but these headphones sound richer and more vibrant than almost all the headphones I’ve tried before. They were on par or better than most brand name headphones.<br /><br />These headphones seem to feature passive noise canceling technology. They are pretty good at minimizing the outside sound while in use, and even when they are turned off. Several times I was in a situation where someone tried to talk to me while I was wearing them, and I had to take them off in order to hear what the person had to say.<br /><br />These headphones are probably one of the most reductionist ones that I’ve seen. They are just made out of two oversized earbuds and a connecting cord between them. This is the ideal form factor for the sports headphones. The earbuds are pretty large and stay firmly in my ears even during the moderately fast runs. The extra sports ear cushions make the fit very snug. The connecting cord loops around the ears but they weren't as tangle free as I expected, which gives the headphones extra stability. I’ve used them while running for several days and they stay firmly in the position. They score high on both the form factor and the comfort level.<br /><br />I have not used these headphones much for phone calls. In general I find Bluetooth headsets to be quite inadequate for voice phone calling. The mic on these headphones also seemed below average, but then again, I was not going to use them for telephony anyways, so this aspect of the headphones neither bolsters nor diminishes a case for them.<br /><br />I will be monitoring these headphones for the foreseeable future. If they manage to survive a year of use in the gym, and their battery power does not significantly diminish over that period of time, then they might be the best overall sports Bluetooth headphones that I have come across.<br /><br />**** Product provided free for review purposes. ****e not used these headphones much for phone calls.

-1,Don't buy this - Power and volume buttons will not work with the case on the phone.
1,"Quality and super fast shipping. Product is plain black which is fine with me figured I could decorate it my own way then. Very good quality with a nice fit, doesn't slip around at all. A little bulky but not bad at all and you will get that with any phone cover. I am so pleased with my order. Definitely would order from this company again without hesitation."
1,"Purchased this charger because the usb connector on my nexus 7 (2nd gen.) became loose and the usb cable would not stay connected to charge the unit. It took around 4 hours to go from 5% to 100% charge. It doesn't come with the adapter, but I had a 2.1 amp 5v adapter that I had purchased for another device and it works perfectly. It does exactly what it says it does and is a good value for the price. This was a lot less expensive than fixing the usb port on the tablet and I can use it to charge any qi enabled devices I buy in the future. It is also conveniently portable."
1,Very good fit
1,"This case works great. It stays in place while I am jogging and doing zumba. My iPhone 6 was able to fit in it no problem with my slim phone case on. Compared to my current armband case this one has a larger adjust-ability range. I was able to have it fit on my forearm as well as my bicep and it fit on my husband's bicep as well and his are much larger than mine. The strap and the back of the case isn't quite as cushy as my other one, but it is still fairly cushy. Overall this case is very good and very function-able.<br /><br />I did receive this item either at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br />All thoughts and opinions are my own."
0,it was correct as it describes in ad
1,"I would give it 5 stars, if it had a magnet in there to turn the screen on and off automatically upon opening/closing. I was able to glue a magnet in myself to have this function. Otherwise, it works great and saves me from carrying an extra wallet around."
1,Fits perfectly and does not interfere with phone capabilities.
1,perfect
1,Works great!  Such a great deal for the price!!
1,"Be aware though, there is nothing high speed about this."
0,Two of the Chargers work great. One is loose and will not stay plugged in. It falls out of the receptacle.
1,I tested this device out in the field and was pleasantly surprised! Off of one wall charge that took about 2 hours the device was fully charged. I was able to get two and a half charges on my Samsung Note 4. When the charger is in the sun and plugged in it will hold the charge on the phone but won't  charge it.  All in all I'd say it's a sturdy device. Works as advertised! Clip to gear and forget till needed.
-1,Garbage
1,"I sadly did not receive my package the first time, but I definitely do not blame that on the seller. They communicated with me just fine and I'm so glad that they sent it once more.<br />This is just as I expected. It's super lovely and just adorable.<br />My only complaints are that it's smaller than I expected and it also has many scratches on it.<br />They scratches are not that visible though, so everything is just fine!<br />5/5 Would buy again"
1,Great case and cute too.
-1,Stylus part fell off on the second day even though I was extremely careful. Do not buy.
-1,"NOT WATERPROOF!<br />Do not buy this case! I bought this case to take my phone with me on a white water rafting trip. I made sure to test the case thoroughly before actually trusting it with my phone. It was in the raft the entire time and never got wet except for the occasional splash. The case didn't last at all and soon the case was trapping water in more than it was keeping water out.. Afterwards, I took my phone out of the case asap and it was completely drenched. There was even water inside the camera underneath the lens! It's truly a miracle that my phone is still somewhat operational. I would not recommend this case to anyone!"
1,I wasn't sure about this at first but it has grown on me. It works really well and if you get the tv antenna and upgrade the GPS antenna this thing is worth every penny. I only wish that customer service understood english a little better but the product is great. Custoemr support is more than willing to assist and it's pretty easy to use.
-1,not real good
1,All good
0,"The earpiece is comfortable for me and I can hear clearly but the one that got sent to me is defective.  The microphone doesn't work.  This is a Huge problem because I can't use the earpiece alone and the mic on the walkie talkie, so now I have to keep my walkie talkie turned way up in the class room."
1,"Magnet is super strong.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the strength of the magnet, it sometimes unclips from the vent when I go to pull my phone off.  Otherwise a very good product."
1,Cheap and works as it should.
-1,"I was in the market for a powerpack in the 10000mAH range and saw this go on sale, at $25 I thought it was a steal.<br /><br />Barely lasted 3 months of occasional use before the battery died. I was only able to fully recharge my phone once or twice, after that - even when fully charged the power pack would struggle to charge my items (Samsung Galaxy S4 and a Kindle Paperwhite). About a month after I got it the 4th power indicator bar stopped lighting up. Then slowly each week or so I'd lose another bar until finally the unit died, and now will no longer charge.<br /><br />The product description says good for 500 charging cycles, I maybe had 60."
0,Very loose fit. only 2 out of three works.
1,Exactly what we wanted. Sturdy.
1,Fits most cases that I own for my phone that's the reason I purchased this item and it has great clear sound not cheap Materials they made it out of.
1,"Ordered this for my husband so he can keep up with his phone while at the gym so he doesn't have to worry about loosing his phone or gym card.  He has only  used it once, but said so far he really likes it and it's comfortable."
1,"I own several items by Cyverlandtron and they have all been great. So when I had the opportunity to test their dual (2.1 amps & 1 amps) port USB car adapter at a discount for my review I jumped on the opportunity. This adapter is made of plastic but are very well built and strong. I dropped mine on the concrete driveway and it did not break. They are also nice and small in size so it does not take but to much extra room.<br /><br />I tested the car adapters against my house charger to see how fast these thing really were. To my surprise the estimate charge time my phone (Samsung Galaxy 6) gave me was within a minute of the house hold charger that came with the phone. When I plugged a second phone in (iPhone 6) the estimated charge time only dropped by 1 minute. So the quick answer is these car adapters are just as good as charging in the house with the chargers that came with the phones. I like that they have a blue light that lets you know when they are plugged in and charging.<br /><br />Quick pros:<br />Fast charging times<br />Charge 2 devices at once<br />Blue light to let you know it is working<br />Strong, well built<br />Small in size<br />Will charge apple products<br /><br />I Recommend this car adapters."
1,"This is a great gadget that is very important to carry while traveling.<br />I used it while taking a vacation and had no issues at all. it is shock proof, water proof and dust proof . it charges very well and though it took little longer to charge my note 4 but well at least i had backup. I had no electricity outlet for miles and miles but that didn't worry me.its a  high capacity rugged 10200mAh power bank (2.1A Power Output) that is perfect for smartphones, tablets and portable electronic devices.<br />This is cute looking and has  built in flash light , compass and Carabiner. Perfect for people like me who love to spend most of my time outside.<br />I was provided this at discounted price in return for my honest opinion."
1,"I absolutely love this case. I like that I can use the case to prop up the phone in order to watch videos without holding the phone. I am satisfied with this purchase. The texture of the case took a little while to get used to. Overall, this is a sturdy and protective case for my phone. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
-1,Extremely cheap cover. Not worth the price. The art work/graphic is blurry and a bit off centered.
1,"Perfect. Recommend it highly. Fit my iPhone 5s to a t. Easy to install. Love especially the High Impact Hybrid Armor Silicone material. I give it 5 stars because it is such a great case. My only wish is that it would be provided in more than the red color. And after two other tries with buying other VAKOOS &#34;suggested&#34; cases in the same ad by the seller as having the same silicone material, I can tell you for a fact they do not."
1,"This is sleek and very well packaged. I'm happy with the quality of this product all around. I am thankful to have received this product at a discount for my honest review. What a great way to charge your phone. The future is now and this is an awesome example. My sister in law has the samsung galaxy s6 and I gave this to her. It charges her phone perfectly. This looks great on any night stand. Easy to use too. It has a grip to keep your phone in place and charges through her case. This makes life so easy. You just drop it and walk away to come back to a fully charged phone. No more hassle with finding a charger cable before bed. Just like the samsung commercials, this is a game changer. You don't have to have the newest phone to use it either if you buy a Qi adapter for your current phone. Worth every penny and full price is a great value."
1,Still on the windshield after a few months.
1,This product has helped in my travels across Europe not only did it charge my iPhone 6+ rather quickly (30/40 mins from 10% charge).
1,Excellent.
1,great quality
1,I like this headset and use it regularly.  They connect easily with my phone and sound good (not great)  They are fairly comfortable to wear for long periods.  Good value for the money.
-1,My first impression of this case was that it was sleek and modern looking. However I had this case for less than 24 hours and when I took my phone out of my pocket the gold bumper was cracked in half. This case is not meant to protect a phone what-so-ever.
-1,"Don't waste your time or money. Purchased through Amazon, the original and the replacement one never worked. Even went to my local Best Buy and tried to buy one there, the Geek Squad couldn't get it or another one they opened from the shelf to work."
1,good
-1,Crap phone
1,My wife loves it. Helps keep it of the counter and saves space since you can place items closer to it without worrying about getting burned.
0,Works great! I have dropped my phone twice and this saved the screen. Only issue is bubbling a little on the right side of screen
-1,"Very pretty but very poor quality, broke in 3 days."
1,I loved them. Once I got them set up so they would stay in my ears. Sound great. the batt. lasts through several workouts. I have not had them very long so I do not know how long they will last.
-1,"Looks great, BUT lasted a little over a month. The lightning port broke while I was unplugging it... I'm never buying Aduro products again."
-1,This case broke in the first week.  It also did not protect my phone and my Iphone cracked.  The other Incipio cases are better.
-1,It did not work as it was advertised.
1,Excellent Thank You..
1,"I own 4 Anker products and have never been dissapointed. Their products are over-engineered and are built to last. I was contacted by customer service a year or so ago about an issue some customers were having with one of the multi-port charging adapters. Mine was fine but they offered, and delivered, a free upgraded versionhe charger. How are you going to beat that?"
1,Love this band and I've used several. Sturdy. Adjustable for various sizes. Yup! Win.
1,"Perfect fit for the Samsung 1900. This also fits the 1700, this is my secind one and worth the price."
-1,"Never written a review before, but after reading so many others, figured I had to post as well.<br /><br />This 100% does not work the way it is intended, I'm now looking for a new radio that has an AV jack so I can just plug my IPhone directly into the radio.  This product is beyond frustrating, could not find a single station that would play music without a ridiculous amount of static.  Paid $30 at Target, will be returning this product ASAP."
1,nice quality fit great. how much it will protect not sure. had for over a month still in super shape. prob. ships from like china takes a long time to get. but it was worth the wait for a fan who was at the last 3 shows!!!!!
0,"I Read other reviews, and yes - not much storage and now and again its a bit slow on task switching. But - its a cheap phone so duh. Fact is if you need a $100 LTE android for gmail, maps, IM etc it is fine. Facebook is a bit laggy no doubt because its a hog app. Screen size is small but perfectly useful. Battery life is OK, I usually make about 20 minutes of voicecalls a day and check email,, text as usual and by evening its down to 40% or so. If you want a gaming phone with more storage, spend more money."
1,Works great with my ATT Note 4. Has a large coil that my Note 4 see's as soon as it's placed on it.  The size gives my Note a sturdy base to sit on so I can tap anywhere on the screen and not knock it off the charger.
0,"Solid case, feels nice. Not too bulky but the biggest drawback is that my headphones can't plugin with the case on. Quite annoying."
1,It was exactly what I wanted. Lightweight. Fit the s6 perfect. Wish they had more colors to choose from.
-1,Way too big for my S6. Extremely disappointed
1,wonderful - I love it!  Protects the phone and is durable.
1,"I bought this case for my niece. She loves it. It fits good and looks cute too. It is what it says it would be, a hard case.With a great price!"
0,My cousin loves it. I guess.
1,"I was fortunate enough to buy this while it was in its promotional launch, but now I'm buying a second for my other car. Great quality, simple and easy to use, and extremely convenient. I've used other similar phone holder devices that either slid around or the magnet wasn't strong. This one is great! Thanks!"
1,"This is a great quality product.  There is not a lot of protection on the front side of the phone case, it has a low smooth front profile, but the wallet portion is great and holds a great deal very securely.  Despite the low profile, it is a great design.  We will definitely be purchasing another one."
1,"Good product, not perfect, but none have been, to date. A hint about separating the well made halves would have been helpful for the age and experience impaired ;)"
1,Works as described & I like it allot better than one that I had that had a separate remote to take the picture. My only gripe is that the instructions are far from in depth & you need to figure out some stuff on your own.
-1,Hate it!
-1,never works
1,I love my new case.  It protects my phone and looks great.  Highly recommend Otterbox!!
1,Fits well and not impossible to put on the phone.
1,Excellent
1,Thanks very much!
1,Here we are five years after I bought this phone and I'm still using it as a back-up. It's been all over the world and keeps on ticking like it was brand new!
-1,"Clip ripped off in a month,still give it 2 stars because I think it will be okay wearing it on the belt. Could not have used the belt sleeve without the clip getting in the way until the clip ripped off. It's like they knew the clip would be temporary so they had the sleeve so you could wear it on the belt after the clip gave out."
0,"Hoping to look more leather-like.  but, Grandchild was pleased."
1,"So far, I love my speaker. Out of the box it was almost fully charged - it was great to be able to use it right away. Incredibly easy to install and setup, and day-to-day connecting and playing music is a breeze. While I didn't like the next/previous and volume buttons being the same, I've gotten used to it and actually appreciate the multiple use of the buttons."
-1,the back did not slide out had to pry it open. would like to return
1,Very good quality case and awesome price!
1,Very good product. I would buy again from this company. No problems.
1,Works great I got it for my moms iPhone 6 and she enjoys the style and protection this case offers
1,Got 2 in today. Very Please so far. The Magnets may very well be stronger than the Pebble Cable. Charged my watch no problems
1,I love this case!!! Thank you so much!!! I highly recommend it
1,works well.
1,Great product and easy to use!  It comes with sticker hinges which makes it so simple to put on without any bubbles to deal with.  Best screen protector I have used.
-1,Worst purchase I've ever made !
1,"VERY GOOD CASE JUST ONE PROBLEM UNABLE TO USE YOUR FINGER PRINT TO LOG IN WITH THIS CASE, HAVE TO REMOVE CASE OVER ALL VERY NICE CASE"
1,"Everything is good except that the Glass doesn't lay flat all the way, leaving some air pocket at the edge. It doesn't matter too much because it's in the edge of the screen."
1,fits my blackberry
1,Great cover for my gen 4 IPOD. Easy install
1,Seems to be charging my iPad Air just fine!
1,Upscale quality.  Excellent value.  No worries on this purchase!!
1,Good producto
-1,Looks nothing like the picture at all! The case BROKE as soon as I put it on my phone!
-1,Terrible product. I was initially impressed as it worked as it should but it quickly stopped working and I had to purchase another product from another vendor.<br /><br />Stopped working in less than 4 months.
-1,Breaks easy not sturdy
1,Excellent product!!!
1,Definitely worth the money!  I haven't really pushed it to the limit but it charged my phone pretty quickly!
1,Great case
1,Just received my  case about a week or so ago and seems  very sturdy.  No problems so far.
1,no problems<br />arrived sooner than expected
1,I love it... totally cute and so much fun!  :0)
1,Good quality with cheap price. I always charge 4~5 phone & tablet but it shows me good performance every time.
1,Very happy with this product.
1,"I love this little speaker! It has better sound than other speakers in this price range, and I like the way it functions better too. I had an older version of this very speaker which went bad on me, and Noria reached out to me after my bad review, and sent out a newer version to me free of charge. This newer version has a gentler &#34;speaker on&#34; sound, and doesn't have a &#34;speaker off&#34; sound, which I'm really glad of."
1,Just as I expected. Terrific phone. I'm sold on HTC phones.
1,"Great product, very durable. The only issue I have is that it is not easy to take off and put back on. Still worth it though for the money."
1,Fits my CD player and holds my iPhone 5s well. Love it.
-1,This thing Never worked correctly from day one...  There other models that work much better and cost less..
0,Decent pens for the price.
1,Took it to our Europe vacation and loved it. It was sturdy enough for our SONY camera and worked great to take photos using the camera's self timer.
1,"Great, but if you use wireless or NFC a lot, this will block those features since its made of metal."
-1,charge dont last
1,This case comes in handy when I'm attending formal events.
1,"Excellent Bluetooth.  My friends think I'm talking on my home phone.  I'm a truck driver, the noise reduction on this unit is amazing.  I would recommend this."
1,"Item came in the scheduled amount of time and has worked well for me. I can see where the armband would be small for people with bigger arms. My biceps are about 16 inches around and it fits nicely, but people with arms a little bigger than that may have trouble with the product fitting. That being said, I have no complaints or any problems with the product."
-1,I'd guess it's ok.  But it falls off every 5-10 minutes.  So far I'm able to notice it.  Or someone else does & hands it back to me.
-1,It doesn't work on my note 4 or Samsung galaxy s4
1,loved this case! I didn't like the flap at the bottom that covered the charger port. But other than that it was great
1,Gift for my husband. Perfect fit.
-1,"Unfortunately this has the halo effect around the edges where the glass is to big and goes over the curves of the screen, which i did not mind the look of because it was such a nice feeling protector. BUT this lifting of the edges allowed dust/sand to get in under the glass, and cause it to get several cracks that crossed the screen after only a few days. Skinomi says they have lifetime replacements, but i filled out one of their claim forms on their website, and after a month of no response, i sent another. Still no response. As far as i can tell, their customer service is non-existent, two months of waiting and nothing. Extremely disappointed in this company, and a waste of money."
1,I heart this case...will buy other colors soon to complete my galaxy case wardrobe:)
1,Awesome
1,Good for Venezuelan people
1,Very handy charger. Note Edge eats up batteries. I need at least two full charges to make it through busy day. This charger always allows me to have a charged battery handy or quickly charge a backup. Works off 12V too!
1,"Samsung Galaxy S4 Active Screen protector fits perfectly, was easy to put on, works great."
1,Fit perfectly ! The array of colors were very nice.
0,It was OK but I cant use it.
1,This armband has been very reliable and the price was very good.
0,"The screen protectors were find and the stylus, but the phone snapon case was very cheap and did not fit.  I threw it away."
1,It just sticks to stuff.....great product!
1,Perfect little gadget
1,"really like the case, good protection without being too bulky"
1,This is perfect! Exactly what I needed. This way I get the case I want and I still have a place to hold cards. It's very strong and staying in place. I highly recommend it.
1,Wifey here. I got a coupon for this so I wanted to leave feedback in return. This is a great little device. It plugs easily into the car and has two USB charger slots. Does exactly what it's supposed to do. I may get another one for our other car.
0,"Definitely not one touch, it takes two hands to get the phone in the holder. For the price it's ok since I've no problems with the phone slipping out but if you're looking for a holder that is easy to get your phone in, this isn't the one."
-1,"Worked for 2 charges, stopped working.  Very dissapointed"
1,Very sturdy. Attracts great conversations with fellow Hogwartians!!!
0,Works fine
1,"Very good, works great"
1,Fast charges my Galaxy S6 just like the charger that came with the phone.
1,Very satisfied. Shipped in timely fashion.
-1,"Two issues: took outta package and amazed that this case is all metal-no inner liner of any kind: metal. Put on because it was such a pretty red! Setting it down to charge on couch; slips and falls off. Took it to a store last night and was clutching it so I wouldn't drop it-it's so slippery. So upset about that so I bought a new case right in the store. Out to car; trying to get this pretty red piece of metal off my phone: ouch, pinched fingers! Worried if it would scratch my mint condition iPhone 6+.<br />This is a gorgeous case- that's the only positive going for it.<br />Way too slippery, no protection inside the case, easy to drop, hard to get off. On top of that, I was told I cannot return it. Unsure why- bad product- I sure wouldn't want to drop my phone with this case on..."
1,"Really love that it's clear so I can see the color and contours of my phone, and the bumper is enough to keep the screen cushioned without being too bulky. Haven't had any problems with getting the USB or headphone plugs in! Grippy enough to help keep the phone from sliding out of my hand, but not so rubbery that it attracts dust, pet hair, purse/pocket lint, etc. It's already got some dings and scratches where it protected my phone during uncharacteristically heavy use for me.<br /><br />Very nice option for a low-profile, unobtrusive Nexus 6 bumper!"
1,Just what you expect it is. O_O
1,Adheres very  well even in my big truck
1,Great case I love the kick stand very sturdy also
1,Nice screen protector for the price I is posted at. Not even the slightest scratch so far.
1,Works great
1,Perfect fit and cute as ever.  Took a long time to get.  But it was worth it😊
-1,color was lighter than shown
0,"- The package came on time and everything was perfectly intact.<br /><br />- The sound on them is OKAY. Not like skull candy-quality, but they're alright!<br /><br />- Every time you change the sound on your phone, it makes a loud &quot;BOOP&quot; noise.<"
1,"Charger is working nicely in the two Galaxy S6 we got, Charger has a blue light on during charging and display a green one when it is done, nice way to know that your phone is fully charged."
1,Thanks
1,I bought two of these and they work very well. It makes charging so easy. I highly recommend!
0,It's ok.
1,"Great case as usual. This is my third phone with a Diztronic case. I keep buying them because they always fit great and look good. Button covers are good, too."
1,so far so good. packaging was ok
-1,it worked good for a month... now its pealing back
1,"This product is very well quality, it's thin, but durable as well. My case actually arrived a lot sooner than the expected date was (almost 2 or 3 weeks early) and the customer service of this provider is outstanding."
0,calls get dropped
1,Excellent case!  Really good quality.  I have to say that I was surprised at just how well made it is considering it's so cheap.  It feels nice - not as if it'll fall apart quickly.  It's protected my iPod very well (I've dropped and bashed it a few times already!).  I would definitely buy this brand again.
-1,It was the wrong case.
1,"Love this phone, came in great condition and works fabulously!"
1,"My wife somehow managed to break the USB port on her Samsung Galaxy S5, so we ordered this replacement, which costs dramatically less than taking her phone to a repair shop.  Our original shipment was lost but the vendor quickly sent another one, once notified.<br /><br />Installation involves removing the phone's back, using a tiny Philips head screwdriver to remove the single screw and plastic piece that retains the USB port cover, replacing the broken port with the new one, reinstalling the plastic retainer, retightening the Philips screw and replacing the phone's back.  With the proper tool in hand the entire replacement job takes only two or three minutes."
0,Works great other than I don't know how to set it up to turn on and off with motion. And also has a bunch of lines running through the display but doesn't effect the video.
1,Love this case.. Great colors and protection!! Have dropped phone twice in this case No Problem.. 😍
1,Very attractive looking product. It is extremely easy to use. Works perfectly as an alternative for the original Samsung battery. The charger is a no brainer; charges original Samsung battery very fast (do not expect it to do it in five minutes).
1,As advertised. Simple & inexpensive &#34;smart&#34; phone.
1,After the wite area of the case get dirty and kind change the color.  Mmmm. I try to clean it but the dirty doesn't come off.
1,Does the job well
-1,Doesn't work 2nd one I've gotten. Won't charge my phone. Disappointed.sending it back.
1,"High quality cord, thick and durable. Recommended purchase."
1,Beautiful case I ordered as a gift. Beautiful color. Would definitely buy from seller again.
1,"We can charge all our devices at once. No more arguing over who gets to charge. Great color. Plug folds down for travel. WHen plugged into wall, doesn't block the 2nd outlet. Very pleased with purchase."
1,"I bought this item because I was looking for something I could use when attending events with family or friends. The set up is really quick with this item and I can't imagine anyone would have trouble using it. What surprised me the most was how sturdy this selfie stick was! I also like that it came with a GoPro compatible attachment. Overall, this is a very nice product if you are looking for a quality selfie stick for a reasonable price. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
-1,It doesn't work with my tablet.
-1,"It works, but doesn't fit properly around the camera which can be annoying. Not an exact replacement."
1,Fast charging!
-1,This charges my Galaxy S5 but at a MUCH slower pace than the one that came with my phone. It takes hours while the original charges my phone fully in 30 minutes.
-1,"Case fit and worked but did not notice a change in the battery life, also every time I dropped my phone the case fell apart and all of my batteries came out"
1,Decent holder.  Easy to use.
1,dgnjmmg
1,Perfect....exactly what I needed to get the job done
1,great product
1,"I love my new case! I previously had a similar sloth astronaut case, but when I got my new phone I wanted to get a new animal. I love this. What I did not know was that this case also has a grip on the sides and unlike the sloth astronaut case I had before it is a flexible rubber to come off much easier for wireless charging :)"
-1,Didn't go damage free for 30 days. The case chipped the first time I dropped it and every time since
1,Great Case for the price!!!
-1,"Replaced my Soundpeats with these Tacoon.  Loved my Sounpeats, they looked identical, but that is wear the comparison stops.  The voice is not English, no idea when on, off, pairing, battery low, etc.  but mainly the sound quality is often poor, crackles, disconnects, lowers volume with no prompt."
0,"*I was provided this product at a discount in exchange for sharing my fair and honest opinion*<br />I'm going to be completely honest here: my first impressions upon receiving this case were not good. It feels and, to be blunt, looks cheap. Yes, it's priced to  be very affordable but I personally believe if you're going to do something you should do it right and that goes for companies that put out products. However, despite my initial impression I gave the case the benefit of the doubt and placed it on my device. They did provide a screen protector, but it was one of the cheaper plastic ones and I already have a really nice on on my device so I didn't feel the need to swap it out but this would be a nice plus for someone that didn't already have one.<br />Getting the case on the phone was easy, just like most cases I've encountered, and it fit nice and snug. I admit, after the case is actually on the device it looks nicer and not quite as cheap. I still don't feel like this provides a whole lot of protection for my iPhone, but it would provide at least a small amount in the event of a drop.<br />Overall, I'd buy again and recommend for those who don't have a high chance of dropping your device and don't care that it looks slightly cheaper than your average case - the price makes up for that if you need an affordable backup or two. Let's be honest, I love to mix up the appearance of my phone frequently and these make it so easy to do so. However, if you are a power user like myself, and you travel, are outside, etc a lot and risk dropping your device invest in something that your iPhone can go in with this case on it that provides protection or stick with cases that provide that protection without any extras required."
1,It seems to work fine so far. I haven't got way far away from a station yet to see how it works.
0,"I ordered two of these thinking that if one cracked, I could replace it with the other. I ordered the products three months ago, and both are now cracked. I'm not sure if this has to do with the robustness of the product or my handling of my phone. I would like to replace them again, and I'm not sure how to use the lifetime warranty."
1,No complaints. I like the flat back of the case
0,Sound is great for the price but the Mic isn't the quality I was hoping for
1,good phone. I bought two for gifts. they are pleased and no problems at all. I am buying one for my self. you will not find a better phone for twice the price
1,Beautiful case
1,Terrific!
1,Arrived on time and works great !!!
1,"These are equally as good as Apple's bands and a fraction of the cost! Just wish I could get more colors. I have tried several with the metal ends and they are nothing compared to this! Yellow, red, grey, brow, navy, royal blue are just a few of my requests! Please!!!"
1,"Excellent product, quality color monitor including night vision at a bargain basement price.  The only downside is when mounting to the license plate, the width partially covers the existing inspection stickers.  Installation was a challenge, more so for my Toyota 4Runner then with the VW Jetta.  My first thought was to use Geek Squad but I decided to do it myself.  About 2 hours for each vehicle to get connected to power and cable run to the receiver.  The video cable wasn’t long enough for either vehicle so I purchased 15 ft cables with adaptors.  You’ll may also need additional power cable depending on where you tap the reverse sensor cable.  Great product, great price and I would highly recommend."
1,"As the headline states....<br />Pros:<br />- Small footprint<br />- Official Samsung product<br />- Cool futuristic-looking LED indicator lights<br />- Comes with 2 amp charger<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Positioning your device can be a bit tricky at first (not a big deal at all)<br />- Doesn't charge as fast as the cable (Galaxy Note 5 has wireless quick charging tech - so not applicable for Note5)<br />- It could be a tad bit larger... I was surprised as to how small it was (TWSS)<br /><br />This is the future, my friends... I can't imagine how I've charged my phone without it for all these years... 5 Stars."
1,Excellent product!  Fast delivery!
1,My husband loves this case. Definitely a good purchase
1,good
1,Great case period
-1,it slips out of my belt!!! almost lost my cell phone!!!
1,"Looks nice, not too bulky"
0,The sound is very good however I am facing a problem with my iphone 6 plus (IOS 8.4). The sound on the other side during gsm calls is very low and sometimes the other person could not hear me well. I hope that anybody can share with a solution for this problem.
1,"We just got my step-kids cell phones, and needed an extra charger so they could have one at each home. These were a third of the price of the chargers at the store, and work just as well as the OEM ones. Incredible value!"
-1,Really cute looks just like a game boy but too big for the phone.
1,"It was a little confusing because I thought it would be the size of an iPhone 5 but it was huge because it was actually for an iPhone 6, it still works, but the description is confusing."
1,Great product great costumer service great prices
1,Nice
1,I love this case.
1,Very good! I bought one for each of my cars.
1,"I’ve been using this external battery charger for a week now and it has been working great as I’d expect from any Anker product! I’ve used it to charge my Samsung Galaxy S5 and my Acer Tablet a few times and it works as expected. This is really not a complex product, it has a micro USB input charging port so that way you can charge the battery using a USB charger of some sort. It’s a 13400mAh capacity battery so it does take several hours to charge it, just plug it in and leave it overnight and you’re good in the morning.  It has 2 full size USB ports to plug your devices into and charge, they’re standard Anker PowerIQ USB ports so you can plug anything in and charge it without having to worry about anything. It can output 2.4 amps per USB port so it can charge your phone/tablet in a hurry.  There is a little button on the front of this external battery that you can press and it lights up a circle of LED lights to indicate how much juice is left in the battery, it’s a nifty little feature so that way you know when this external battery needs to be recharged. This battery charger is about the size of a wallet, very portable and heavy for its size of course since it’s packed full of battery cells. I like the look and feel of it, it’s certainly not an eye sore. I think it will fit right in sitting right next to your phone/tablet/whatever device you have. So bottom line, this external battery charger will charge your phone multiple times and it’s very easy to use. Anker backs it up with an 18 month warranty as well so they got you covered if the unfortunate should ever happen. I attached pictures of my unit to this review as well, it’s charging my Acer Tablet and Samsung GS5 at the same time."
1,Good product
1,Purchased this for my son an he loves it use his kick stand while watching movies an clips to his hip when we're out perfect for a nine year old or adult
1,"Love this product but it stopped charging after a month. By the time i had a chance to return it the time had expired. The company still honored our return and sent one without us sending the broken one back yet. I love the size of this product verses different shapes. This works best with my iPhone due to them being about the same size.<br /><br />I would recommend this company to anyone and will be giving these as Christmas gifts.<br />Thanks PowerAdd,<br />Joe Beniche"
-1,The rhinestones were coming off when I received the case. The case does not fit the Galaxy S6 as it should and all the edges of the phone are uncovered. Not pleased.
1,They work as you'd expect a USB cable to work. The connector on one no longer sticks in my phone but I think that's because I dropped it and it landed on the connector.
1,"It is great.  Easy to use.  Works.  You can just leave a battery sitting on top of it and it will charge it.  I am doing this because the charging back has arrived yet.  I am sure that will work just as well.  Too bad Samsung didn't put on in my Note 4 when they designed the thing in the first place, just another example of them falling away from what consumers want."
1,I replaced the boston acoustic in my camaro with these and it has been a different world.  Def way better.
1,"Beautiful cases with vibrant colors and a textured feel.  They are definitely for look, though, and not protection."
1,Love it
1,Great sound quality and noise cancellation in relation to the price. Fits great and has a decent microphone.
1,The case was a perfect fit and meet our expectations. Will order from them in the future
-1,"The band was OK, but way to large for my small wrist so I had to return. A description of sizing would have been helpful. If you have a small wrist, I doubt this will work for you."
-1,Had this for a couple months and now doesn't work . Don't buy these cheap car chargers
1,"Very easy to put on, and I really like the lifetime warranty"
1,Wow! What a power house! It doesn't take me long to charge my iPhone/pad now. So glad I decided to purchase it.
1,"I bought 2 of these (one for travel, one for my office) based on the reviews.  And I am VERY happy that I did.<br /><br />I have the stainless steel version of the watch, and the slightly higher &#34;lip&#34; on the front of this charging cradle keeps the watch from falling out of the stand due to the weight of the band.  Also FWIW the charging time seems slightly faster going from &#60; 10% to 100%.  But the difference is only a few seconds by stopwatch, so that may not be entirely accurate.  At any rate I would buy this charging cradle again, and I would recommend it to friends and family members."
1,"It’s make more easy to charge your phone beside it’s help me to keep more organize my desk, the only think I see if u own a IPhone  (5, 5s & 6) the audio jack it on the bottom so u probably will not be available to charge you phone and listen music"
0,Bow fell off and we had to glue it back on. Not the greatest quality.
1,worrks very well !! no problems !!
1,GOOD PURCHASE
1,"Works great, but don't use the holder in the car on dash, mine ruined the spot where I suck it"
1,perfect
1,perfect
1,real good phone
1,"This is a great opening tool. The thin metal makes it easy to get into many tight spots that other opening tools can't get into. The vinyl coating that makes the handle makes the tool reasonably comfortable to use as well as providing adequate grip on the tool. The tool is flexible but still stiff enough to use effectively. I'ts thinness as well as its, shape and size makes it ideal for getting under the glass for removal. I have used this on phones, tablets and laptops for the purpose of glass replacement and it has proven extremely useful in all situations.<br /><br />This tools is metal and can damage the bezel and or the LCD. Caution is required to not scratch or damage the LCD. However, this tool is often the one that I use to get an opening started so that I can get other tools that are less likely to cause damage to the LCD between the bezel and the glass. If I'm careful I can use this tool to get around the entire glass without causing any damage from the tool."
1,Would not hold the phone firmly in the case. Allowed it to come out breaking the screen. Had to purchase a new phone.
1,"I am not one to usually write amazon reviews but I felt compelled after putting this product on...  I can say, without a doubt, this was the single easiest screen protector installation I have ever done. Wow... I was shocked how painless that was.  I have always had a love hate with screen protectors and more recently opted to stop using them for about a year. Of course, though, since getting my Note 4 a few days ago I was having new phone jitters so I caved and ordered one. I have never tried these tempered glass variants before but heard good things so for the price of this one I thought why not.  I got to say... again... Wow. The installation... flawless. Just immediately goes on and works itself onto the screen with no air bubbles or needing any sort of credit card smoothing for 20min.  Instructions on the screen protector was really easy to follow and it comes with everything you need to get it installed.  *You're Awesome Thank You card *Dust-absorber *Wet *Dry *Glass Screen Protector  ************************************************  The correct order of application is: 1. Use the WET cleaning pad on the phone screen. 2. Use the DRY wipe to completely dry the phone screen. 3. Use the Dust-absorber to remove dust which may have settled. 4. Remove the label &#34;①Step&#34; from the glass screen protector. 5. Gently press the middle of the glass screen protector, then ensure the protector has no air pockets by pressing gently but firmly against it from the center outward.    In terms of the actual feel and look of it? It feels great. I am really pleasantly surprised by this protector (granted it has only been about 10 min). It truly feels like nothing is on the screen but at the same time feels like a great layer of protection. It is clear, with no noticeable deterioration of screen quality.  Another point worth mentioning. The packaging of this brand of protector is fantastic. Comes in a hard cardboard book style inclosure. Provides 1 screen protector with a anti static wipe cloth as well as a alcohol prep tab. 10/10 for packaging. Well done Yootech. I don't think I have ever seen better packaging for a screen protector.  I may have found a rejuvenated love for screen protectors now because of tempered glass, and especially this brand. The purchase of this protector is a no brainer. You cannot beat the price for what you get."
1,very easy hook up.  Nice to be able to use it with my camera on my ipod
1,"Worth every penny...Not two days after purchase, I dropped my phone out of the car door getting out to go to the grocery store. The durable rubber made the phone bounce lightly and protected it completely-not even a scratch!"
1,Perfect! Just what I was looking for.
-1,"Within less than 3 weeks the print was fading and the card holder slots were ripping apart. It held the phone nice but as for the case itself, its a certified POS. I'm already having to order a new case. Definitely not going with this on again"
0,Nice cover for the back but doesn't do anything to protect the front.
1,Just as described.  Very protected.  It does add some weight.
1,"I love this phone case! Not only is it a beautiful gold colour but it's so functional! I bought this phone case because I don't like carrying around a wallet or purse, and I tend to leave (lose) my debit card and ID in whatever pair of pants I wore the day before. With this case, I have them on me all the time. The sliding door works perfectly; it doesn't open too far, it makes cards easy to access, and it doesn't open unless you want it to. For something that holds two credit cards, it's also surprisingly slim. This case is also super heavy duty. I dropped my phone from the top of a 20 step staircase onto ceramic tile and there wasn't a scratch on it! For something that does so much, it is completely worth it and I would 10/10 recommend."
1,Out of sight love it thank you😜
1,love it
1,I bought one for my daughter and she loved this.  The compact design holds a lot of charges when you're on the go💥‼️
1,Excellent.
1,Good case for the money
1,"This is good.  I thought it would charge my gadgets faster, but I haven't noticed any increase in speed over my old chargers."
-1,I am pretty sure that the 'screen replacement' is not glass and is plastic. Very miss leading and complete udder junk.
1,The only problem with this case is they send you a USB cord to charge the phone but no plug for the wall!!!! You may have to buy several till you find one with the right voltage or it will constantly beep at you. If your reading this life proof it is BS to spend over $100 and not be able to plug into the wall. Other than that the case seems to be excellent and the battery works great.
1,Worked right away with my wireless charger. Shouldn't have been so darn expensive but I'm glad to have it!
1,Great case! Has a good grip to the phone and looks super cute!
1,"Works as expected. I use it in my car, so I can charge multiple devices on the go."
-1,"The battery arrived dead and won't charge - there's an 'X' over the icon at startup.<br /><br />An RMA was issued pretty promptly, but waiting on results."
1,good product.  The kit came with things (location tabs and dust sticker) that were not present in the last tempered glass cover I purchased.
1,"For one who's always nervous about my ability to completely remove the dust particles and push out the bubbles between any kind of glass surface protector, applying this tempered glass made me feel like a pro! The application videos are incredibly helpful, and the tempered glass comes with a clearly labeled 3 step application kit that makes everything very simple. And it looks AMAZING when complete! I'm a fan!"
1,"They are comfortable and unlike most earbud style headphones, they actually stay in my ears and don't hurt. They are great for running."
1,Was as advertised.<br />Easy install.<br />Would recommend to others.
-1,"Application was flawless, however the edges chipped and left a shard of glass in my thumb. Would not recommend to anyone."
1,"I really like these, they sound great, are comfortable for long usage, and i get more than 5 hours of battery life."
1,Loved this case so much. Eventually the colors got a little dull and nasty but overall a wonderful case!
1,WONDERFUL
-1,Counterfeit- not a real Kate Spade case. The design on the back is a sticker. The case is inferior quality and shipped directly from China.<br />Caveat Emptor!
-1,It has no screen protection whatsoever.  I thought it may come up further around the edge to protect against dropping it but it doesn't.  All this is is a pretty case.
1,"Does its job, costs basically nothing. Good product."
1,"Good sturdy mount, hold my s5 like a champ!"
1,"I had no problems with this cable.  It did what I expect it too, charged my Kindle in a timely fashion.  I do love the length. It allows me to not be so close to the wall when using why charging.  Glad for the freedom."
1,"Although this is a very attractive case, I don't like it as much as the case I had for my Samsung Galaxy S4.  That one was shock-proof, whereas this one is not. However, this one is very attractive and slim. It has a good grip, so your phone doesn't slip around. It's exactly what I ordered, but I wouldn't trust it to protect the phone against a drop off of the kitchen counter or anything."
1,Exactly  what I was looking for - works great.
1,These are well worth the money. I carry the phone in my front pants pocket and this cover does not add any unnecessary bulk and it is easy to put in and take out of the pocket.<br /><br />Fit is perfect and gives me a sense of security feeling as though the phone is protected.
-1,"I could never get this thing to work.  I reached out to the company twice, requesting help to set it up and got no response.  I'm so disappointed."
1,"Really keeps things dry. However, the touch screen can be unresponsive under water."
1,Did the job!
1,"Product's home key did not work.  Company did say I could return it, however my husband had thrown all of the bad parts before I could."
1,These have worked perfectly with the Lifeproof case I have on my iPhone 5.<br />Well made and much cheaper than paying 19.99 for just one through the original company.  Shipping was fast and packaged great.  Thank you.
-1,H O R R I B L E
1,"As a family of four we were always fighting over who got to use the one or two USB charging ports in the car, until we bought this.  I've tried other chargers that have two or three ports but none would deliver a reliable charge if you used all of the ports.  This one is different. Even with two phones and two tablets charging at the same time none of the devices complain about a lack of power.<br /><br />We give it eight thumbs up."
1,Fits perfectly!  L
1,The best cell phone case I've every had!  Precision fit and finish.  Great protection - front and back.
1,It's exactly like the photo not very protective tho feels nice in the hand as well
1,Very nice cover for my cell phone. Was as described and works great.
-1,garbage! The rear credit card door wont stay closed! Molding around the case is uneven. Don't do it!
1,Works great
1,"Like the phone a lot.  This phone replaces the HTC evo 4 g.  The screen, and sound are superb and it is very fast.  I am suprised at how good my battery life is.  To my suprise I was impressed with how easy it was to convert my data from the evo to the desire 816."
-1,"My case was busted within a week of owning it. The screen protector separated from the rest of the case while I was taking it off of my phone, which totally ruined the waterproof aspect of the case. Turns out it was just a tiny dab of glue holding it in place to begin with.<br />Certainly not &#34;life proof&#34; as it broke before I even dropped it. Waste of money. Will return and buy a competitor's brand."
-1,IT DOES NOT HAVE CC SLOT OR POUCH!!! SO UR NOT GOING TO GET WHAT IS DESCRIBED FOR THE ITEM!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED
-1,Poor material! broke at folding lines in 2 months.
1,"Nice unit. Sound is kinda muffled, not very crisp. My biggest complaint is the short battery life. 4-5 hours max. Sure to get shorter as unit ages."
-1,Case was too thick and made phone difficult to operate.
1,Superb quality!
1,"These hit hard! Too hard if I turn the amp up. I have 2, I could have easily got away with just 1."
1,This smartphone holder for my bike was just what I was looking for.  Received it quickly and everything is terrific.  Thank you Vibrelli for doing what you do so well.
-1,Hey man no gorilla glass this is misinformation.
1,Perfect for the upgrade.
1,Very pleased with the product after having it replaced.  Avantek quickly replaced my defective product with a new transmitter. They were very concerned and worked hard to achieve my satisfaction.
-1,"I originally gave this product a good review, however, I have to regretfully change it because it didn't last a month. Spend a little more and go into your phone dealer and get a real Samsung. This one is not real. It is much shorter than the real one and it just stopped working. When I took it into the store, they told me that a lot of these sold online are replicas made with the Samsung name and are poor quality. I really wanted it to work because the price was great, but I was disappointed."
-1,The closing part is already wearing out but I do love the case
1,Great products
1,"[[VIDEOID:d900b5fc95ff333f5d63a0e92681ff04]]I brought this for navigating through roads without the need to constantly hold the phone in my hands. I have been using this for 4 days and this is a great product.<br /><br />- The materials used for manufacturing the device are good quality, solid and sturdy.<br />- Set up is very easy, attach the holder to the clamp provided and just push the suction cup on any flat surface.<br />- The suction cup is good quality and holds the device and the phone well.<br />- The device doesn't shake much when hooked in the car. The device holds the phone very well.<br />- The holder can be adjusted to any angle.<br />- The arm of the clamp also can be adjust to any angle.<br />- It can hold devices unto iPhone 6.<br /><br />Very happy with the purchase and would recommend buying this.<br />Disclaimer : I received the product for my honest review."
-1,"I was pleased with this item for about a day. the second day of owning this item, there was a weird, static noise that you could hear when music was being played. also there's an annoying ticking noise that you always hear between 2 second intervals every time the cassette is in the cassette player. I really do not recommend this item. I suggest buying a $10-$15 cassette aux player, that's actually worth it."
-1,Lasted only 4 months and now will not charge.  Doesn't have a warrant or anything.  You would think electronic's would have a 1 year warranty.<br />I have always trusted Plantronics equipment.
0,"The item works fine and fits snugly on my arm. Not giving a higher rating, because there is a black scuff mark on the clear screen viewer that will not clean off. It doesn't hinder seeing the screen too much, but it is very annoying to have this on a brand new item."
1,Love it. Work great with my Note 5. It say fast charging on the display when you plug it in. Take about 90 min to fill it up from 5-100%.
1,Covers the phone snugly.  Is slim fit and isn't bulky.  Doesn't seem like a lot of protection if you drop the phone.
1,"I've been using this case for a few months now and while I have never really dropped it enough to truly test it, I have no complaints. It's easy to slip on and off, while also adding minimal bulk to an already good sized phone (iPhone 6 plus). My only one small complaint is that the back plate feels like it isn't completely connected towards the bottom."
1,"Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion. This product is special and different from the other iPhone 6 plus case not only because it is strong and of a very nice appearance but because has some extra value. It is very stylish and is built in Sliding Back for securely carry your Driving license, ID and Credit card. Slot will fit 2 cards and it is anti shock!"
1,Perfect for my phone and easy to use.
1,No Problems
1,"Beautiful cover, and pleased with product."
0,Hard to swipe between pages :( I use a cheap one for that. But great for writing.
1,Love it.
1,At first I thought Boss wasn't going to be good. But its a great radio.
1,"This case keeps my LG G3 protected from the outside.  It also covers up the t-mobile logo.  I don't use t-mobile for service and I don't need to flash their symbol around.<br /><br />The case isn't much larger than the phone itself.  It doesn't add considerable bulk, and you wouldn't really be able to tell I have a case on unless you look carefully.<br /><br />One downside to this case is it blocks some thicker ear phone plugs.  I had trouble with one set of earphones I use and had to take the case off in order to use them.<br /><br />I paired this case with a glass screen protector which I've been told does a superior job of protecting screens to the film one.  [[ASIN:B00KC3FMKI Tech Armor LG G3 Premium Ballistic Glass Screen Protector - Protect Your Screen from Scratches and Drops - Maximize Your Resale Value - 99.99% Clarity and Touchscreen Accuracy]]"
0,Cute; not quite as protective as others but very not bad
1,excellent
1,"Great stock replacement for my iPhone. I ordered this knowing that it is always good to have a back up cable, then the day after it arrived my original cable was stolen. Thank goodness I bought this. It works great!"
-1,"This product is okay and does it's job but my only concern is how hot it runs. I'm not sure it is supposed to be like that, but I cannot put it against the skin or pick it up while charging because it is so hot.<br /><br />Updated review: Four months after my purchase at the device completely does not connect now. Not sure what happened. It's never been dropped or thrown or anything. I take good care of my devices and now I wasted money."
1,We tried other kind with bigger tip. We like this better (My husband and I).
-1,Bought it. Seems like it would protect the phone. I ended up returning it though since I liked a different cover better.
1,all good
1,"Fit my 2006 Toyota Prius key perfectly and, since it's lime green, it stands out from our other car keys."
1,Love this screen protector.
1,I'm over whelm with joy! It's just what I needed for my iPod! Thank you very much for providing me with it!
-1,"This  was a great fit, but the cover started peeling off."
1,fantastic transition from the Nexus 5 phone. Great phone.
1,"Good smartwatch, like the fact it has built-in gps. Its definitely a little bulky but is fairly thin. Seems pretty well built but the band is a dust magnet and there really aren't to many options for replacement bands. http://www.amztracker.com/#a_aid=56604032da0ac"
-1,Stopped working 6 weeks after purchase - it just died.<br /><br />The music quality was OK - lost a lot of bass response vs the wired connection to my phone.
1,"I will never buy anything else again, these are phenomenal, Im hoping they make these for my tablet!"
1,"This is a nice temper glass screen protector. It does feel a bit cheap, but it has definitely protected my phone when it fell. It still has not cracked after all these times I have dropped my phone. Definitely a good tempered glass."
1,"Love the look, the feel, the sturdiness. This color combo is really sleek and unique."
1,Great phone for the price
-1,It did not work on any of my devices
1,Works great.  Freed up a lot of space in the power strip since we don't need all the chargers now.
1,It made a world of difference
1,Fits well and does what its supposed to
-1,"These were pretty good at first. I spent some time getting them to fit right, and they have stayed in my ears reliably for several-mile runs. To me, the sound is acceptable, the cord noise isn't horrible, and the battery life has been more than adequate.<br /><br />But today I started a run after forgetting to charge them. After a couple miles I heard the low-battery message, followed a few minutes later by a series of tones when the earphones disconnected from my phone. The music-less run was my fault, but now they won't charge.<br /><br />The red light stayed on after the battery died, and plugging them in to charge did not change that. Nor did holding down any one button or any combination of the buttons. I'm going to try to let them sit for a few days to drain fully with the red light still on...maybe that will reset them.<br /><br />I guess you get what you pay for, but a rechargeable device should be able to shut down and recharge after a low battery."
1,Works great on my Countertop hot water dispenser which I hadn't used for a couple of years.  Somehow I misplaced the old cord during my recent move.
1,great
1,"These work fine in USB 2.0 and in chargers but not in high speed USB 3.0 ports. Otherwise they are fine. They should just advertise them as not working in 3.0 and I'd rate them five. I had that issue when I first got them, contacted the seller and he sent me another batch which was nice but they have the same limitation which is no problem at all if you know about it. They will buzz and cycle on and off in USB 3.0 (the ports with blue inside and generally on the front of Dell XPS workstations) they work fine on all the others and with all the chargers I tried.<br />A major plus is they have small Apple style ends that work with Otterbox and LifeProof cases. With many cables, you have to take the case off. Imagine buying your son an expensive LifeProof case that he has to take off to use a different aftermarket cable with a stubbing end, only to have the iPhone fall into a fish tank! No, I'm not making that one up."
1,Very nice product. Very well made. Works perfectly for me.
1,so far so good. alot of muscle training to learn! from an ex-iPhoner
1,Very nice
0,Great for gym use
1,Fits super snug for my Galaxy Tab A 8.0.<br />I love this case. The price was amazing and shipped faster to me than it said.<br />Recommend this? YES INDEED!
0,Does what it says it does but is very uncomfortable.
0,I like everything about this case except for the size. The built in screen cover is great. The holster is sturdy. It just makes the phone larger than I wanted. Too bad there isn't a low profile model...
1,"perfect, already has made me feel safer on the road and in the bush"
-1,"I received this in the wrong size. Oddly enough I ordered two, one for a regular iPhone 6 and another for the 6 Plus. The protector received for the 6 Plus was broken and this protector was the wrong size, looking as if it might fit an iPhone 5 - big difference! I'd stay away from this vendor and order from the multitude of other vendors offering screen protectors for your tech toys."
-1,"The second I used this screen protector, it cracks, very low quality and waste of money, try use the money to buy a better one. Luckily this time the phone did not damaged, but it is really the worst one I had ever use."
-1,Very disappointed with this device. It is flimsy and only maintains a charged for a short period of time.
0,"i like the length, but the usb end tends to slip off from my car charger. also, it doesn't seem to charge my phone that fast."
1,very good
0,"Works well.. paired up with my Android after taking off the charger and connect really fast. Charges pretty quick, phone connection is strong.  They do look ridiculous, like you have gauges in you ears. Do not try to jog or run with these.  As long as you are going to use these in your living quarters, they work great."
1,Very durable products
1,Great
1,"I know styli can go from really cheap to really expensive quickly.  Frankly, these are cheap but they don't have the latency that I've seen in more expensive one.  For that reason and the price, I give them 5 stars.  They outperform more expensive models and if I burn through 18 of these (I bought 2 packs), I'll just buy more."
1,they fly
1,"I would give this item a 5 star rating if it supported 128 GB (or larger) MicroSDSX cards.  A 64 GB card can record just over 6 hours in High quality (higher than 1080P), which is great.  But it would be great to be able to double that for those really long road trips!<br />Otherwise, I'm totally impressed with the image quality and ease of use of this camera.  It's got a great wide angle view and records well in both light and dark conditions!  Give us a firm-ware update that supports 128 GB cards and I'll re-rate with a 5-star!"
-1,"After 3-4 days, this case got a couple cracks in it.  Now it is falling off.  The quality of the one I got is very poor."
1,Excellent
1,"This is more than I thought.  The convenience of the case, the look are very satisfactory and I would recommend it to all who buy the IPhone."
-1,Screw broke off into my radio the first time I put it on and then I had to send it out for repairs. Pass on this one.
1,Nice case.  Thin adds little bulk to the phone.  Buttons do not have a tactile feel to differentiate them from one another.  Others have complained of difficulty inserting ear phone jacks but I have not experienced this with two different ear sets.
0,"I bought the Mobi-Lens Combo Pack as a birthday gift.  Seemed alright when it came out of the package.  And it clips on to his iPhone5 with the phone case on so I feel like it serves the purpose well.  Gave a three star because it was not able to clip onto the iPhone 5 with it's case on, so it was a hassle to use it.  Also it seems much flimsier than in the pictures.  Wouldn't really recommend it."
1,Great work
1,"Provides good protection with a nice appearance. On/off button on case is a little stiff, however, does prevent accidental  switching on of phone."
1,"Performs exactly as I would expect it to. I saw that other reviewers said that the life of the battery didn't last long and it looked like it was previously used, but mine looked brand new and performs as such."
-1,Horrible product. Fits so loosely in the power slot that it would fall down immediately. Got stolen out of my car and I didn't really care. Would never buy again.
-1,Disappointed. Even the thinnest cover keeps this from working properly and taking off the cover every time defeats the purpose of saving time.
1,Case is very sturdy and seems to deliver the protection i need. Color seems bright and vibrant. Authentication 10/10 !!!
1,like it
1,"I like the minimal covers for my smart phones as I usually baby my phones and have not had too many accidents so far.  I am absolutely delighted with this cover from Otterbox and can't believe I have waited so long to get this for my iPhone 5.  I like the raised edge that protects the face of my phone.  Best of all, mine says &#34;Made in USA&#34; on the inside...can't believe the packaging didn't mention this.  None of the exterior buttons take unexpected pressure to activate the phone, volume, etc.  Very pleased with this cover and will get another when I update my smartphone choice later this fall."
1,I love how light the pen is and the color.  Works well with my Surface.  My only complaint would be the size of the tip.  It is a bit large and makes some site mobility irritating.
-1,not good with galaxy5<br />\
1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NWMI07S/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
1,Perfect combo wallet and phone case!
1,Great product
1,Love this case and colors!! Great protection!!
1,Bought this case for my husband and he love it. Thanks Amazon
1,This was perfect
1,Its ok...for the first time
1,A+
-1,The magnet not keeping it close.not happy.
1,Awesome case
1,Affordable and sturdy case.  I've had no problems with screen sensitivity either.
1,Can't beat it best on the market so far I'm sure there's better out there but for the price it's definitely worth it the only thing I seen that goes wrong with it is the circular thing in the center that you have to press to activate
1,"It is beautiful, elegant, light, i can open screens at once, the photos are beautiful"
1,excellent product!
1,Fast shipping... I'm satisfied overall with it and it works good.. Signal is the same... Great look
1,A life saver
1,"Works as intended, I should probably stock up on these as I tend to loose them quite frequently."
1,Great plug charges everything
1,Love this speaker. Bought it to go paddle boarding and it works great. Can't believe the great sound coming from this little speaker. Very happy with my purchase. Just wish it came in more colors:-)
-1,I will be returning both of the pairs that I ordered.  I will be listening with them and all of a sudden the volume shuts off.
1,"well made, very secure.  S5 mini fits perfectly"
-1,"I just received it and when I opened the package the case was the only thing in it, no charger, no cord and no manual. I want a refund or a package containing the items missing ASAP."
1,Absolutely what ivexpected.
1,Very sturdy.
0,I bought 2. One works great. One does not work at all...which I just realized ...... Wish I could return it but I guess I can't.
-1,nope!  doesnt work!  get a message saying this device does not always work!
1,Works fine; no issues altho I have not charged any devices. No more dropped USB as with previous hubs.
-1,"First of all if I had seen this in person I would pay no more than 20 bucks for it. It shipped very fast but the packaging was questionable. I got it all banged up and scratched. I know leather is soft so shouldn't it have been padded in the package not just a thin plastic slip? The other thing I have a problem with is the case that hold the phone. It fits the fun perfectly but it's atachted the the phone with only glue. From inspecting it I can clearly pull back the case and see the glue and I'm sure it won't last long. I'll probably have to redo it myself. Other than those flaws the case is okay. It easily hold cards and is nice in appearance, but it could have been done better."
1,This is a great item.  I use it on a daily basis and it has not let me down.  Very sticky... sticks to my phone case... and the material is great for fitting a few extra cards in there.
1,"This phone case is great for my 11 years old's first phone, he loves it!  It is easy to get on and off.  The only comment I would make is that the case is too think to keep on when the phone is on an iphone docking station."
-1,"Beware if you think this is simply the micro SIM required for many GSM phones---it isn't.  The nano and adapters do not work in all phones (they get stuck).  And Cricket and the Gamestop stores that sell these have no clue about any of this.  Considering that the individual sim cards probably cost them a few cents a piece, I think it's ridiculous they don't instead include 3 sim cards, not 1 and an adapter.  They seem surprised to hear that nobody carries the individual micro sims any more, and when I finally did aquire one (off amazon no less) it would NOT connect.  They had no clue how to help me regardless of the number of rounds I went to them via phone, store, and online chat.  They finally threw their hands up in confusion.<br />They seem polite, but efficient and professional?  On that they get an 'F' !"
1,Fast delivery and same as advertised.
1,no problem using this product. I triple my minutes
-1,"They are ok, wish it had a longer battery life. Needs to be charged constantly!"
1,Love this wallet case! It's not to heavy but it's definitely secure.  You can't put too much stuff in the card holders or it will not close correctly but that's okay cause it serves it purpose for me.  My license  2 cards and a few dollars in the money slot.
1,Needed a long cord and this filled the bill.<br />Sasha
1,Very good
1,This has been such a life saver! I've already bought two. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a screen protector.
-1,Cheap crap
1,It's light weight and perfect! So tired of bulky cases where the auxiliary chord didn't fit and I couldn't screen shot. This one's perfect.
1,"This is a great product that works great on android.  When connected, the media buttons work great.  If a command isn't sent for a period of time, the device times out but a press or two will wake up the remote and re-establish the connect.  I've used this with multiple Bluetooth stereos and it works great!  I normally keep this mounted on my cars steering wheel. Keep in mind that this can get in your way, so make sure you move it somewhere where it wont cause problems to your driving.<br /><br />There is one annoying problem with this.  On android, it's classified as a keyboard which means by default the soft keyboard will NOT show up when this is connected.  To fix this, you can disable the hardware keyboard, but this setting is not remembered between connections.  So I finally found a fix using Tasker and Security Settings.  When connected to the remote remote, I have a task that triggers a &#34;Configuration - Hardware Keyboard Disabled&#34; using Security Settings.  I hope this helps!"
-1,Thing is junk and the seller is about as bad. Would not purchase this or anything else from this seller. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE STAY AWAY!!!!
1,"I just started using the stand. Nice design, very good cable way."
-1,"they died within a few months, will not buy again"
-1,Takes forever to charge Kindles! I should have trusted the bad reviews.
0,Eh. It works but it sticks out rather awkwardly from my mp3 dock.
1,"It comes with an easy applicator 'wings' that lets you align it without touching the edges - awesome.  Looks great, I don't notice any screen quality changes.  Just be 100% sure there is no tiny lint on the screen before you apply it.  It happened to me, I noticed 1 single strand of lint, so I lifted the edge of the screen protector with a knife and used a lint removing sticker they also include.<br /><br />Only problem I can think of is that it does not reach the edge of the phone, but doing so could cause it to have air bubbles around edge because the Galaxy S6's screen isn't completely flat."
1,"Installed sub this week which replaced my old RF Punch XLC 10&#34;  After tweaking the amp sub gain output a bit, the sound if perfect."
1,"I purchased 3 of this holder; 1 for myself, my husband, and son.  It's perfect!  Holds my iPhone 6 plus so I can use it for navigation.  Great buy!!"
1,Love it the case is beautiful and just perfect and it arrived on time great service! !!!!!!!!
1,Protects the screen.
1,Slim and simple and relatively easy to keep clean. -1 star for the amount not covered at the top of the phone (only covers about 1/2 the width over the top edge of the phone).
1,Excellent.
1,Bargain!!!
1,"Perfect fit, Easy to apply, Quick shipment"
-1,"I was foolish enough to purchase this phone to replace my moto g,man what a mistake.The memory is awful ,but the quality of the phone itself is the worst.I have had this phone for just 8 months never dropped it or had it get wet and out of thin air I now have lines running across the screen.It started with 1 line right after I used the camera,after that every few days a new line would appear.Now I have about 20 lines running across the top half of the screen and thats after more just popped up while writing this review.I contacted Posh support when the 1st line popped up and they were quick to claim physical damage and suggested I send them the phone for them to analyze to determine if it was damaged meaning I would have to pay to send it back to China probably. No way was I going to do that,so I just let them know how defective their products are and that I will never buy another Posh anything again.It comes with a ton of bloatware it has no notification light even for charging,the USB is at the top of the phone.You can't even turn camera shutter sound off ,the battery life is terrible (a phone from 1995 probably got better battery life).the processor is junk Facebook stalls a lot especially if another app is running.The WiFi is awful,I step on my front porch and lose signal.My moto g I could walk 2 full blocks before I lost my WiFi signal from my home router.The sound quality is the worst of any phone on the planet,the front camera is garbage too.To anyone out there that thought about any posh phone do yourself a favor and just scroll to another brand .Please by all means spend not 1 dime on their phones.AVOID POSH PHONES AT ALL COST!Don't even buy it for a child."
0,"The charging pad was easy to install with only a slight bulge in the back of the phone.  It still fit into my Ringke case.  It does take a little time to find the best position on the charging pad, but one found works great.<br />The only problem I had was months after I installed it.  The screen on my phone came unglued at one edge.  I cannot say for sure it was from the constant pressure of the extra thickness of the charging pad.  It only cost $15 to have it reglued at the galaxy store and there was no apparent harm done to the phone.  To be safe I am not going to replace it and have ordered a complete charging back cover."
1,fits great easy to grip. best of all finally a case that covers the stupid apple on back of phone.<br />hate having a window there.
1,i love the fact i can listen to the songs on my phone by using this device.it works perfectly
1,It was a perfect fit and great price!
1,"This is a fantastic product! I purchased it to use while on a 2,500 mile road trip and it performed flawlessly. Sticks to my textured dash without any problems and provides quick and easy access to my iPhone 6."
1,"Very good quality!  comes with everything, very happy with them, sound great and exactly the same to the ones that they gave me with my Samsung galaxy s5(: would definitely recommend!!"
1,Excellent
-1,"So I bought theses covers right after I bought my Note 5, which these say they are for. No matter how you try to put these on, it does not cover the whole screen. For 6 bucks, I really wasn't gonna complain, but if they claim to do something they don't, then why advertise that. Other than that the cover is okay. It would have definitely been a 4 or 5 star, but because the whole screen isn't covered, I deduced some. Granted it is only a super small sliver of screen left..."
1,Great product! Worked perfectly :)
-1,Stylus was great but there was NO INK in the pens :-(
0,This was worth it
-1,"When the product works it is great. However, it has been a pain to try and figure out why the speaker won't work. Only have had the item 4 days. Worked 1 of those days so far."
1,Great durable phone case especially for a klutz like me. Only issue is that it increases the phone size by a quarter inch on all sides and doubles the weight of the phone
1,As promised
-1,Doesn't fit it has dents in battery and looks used
1,"Great stick! Holds a lot of charge, connects easily, good strong hold of the phone. Definitely recommended!"
-1,It is a good case but it is not convenient to take the phone out and put it in.
1,Perfect sound - I take it everywhere and bought one for each of my employees to make them more productive..
-1,Very thin case. The decals on the inside of the case were pealing when I received it. Pictures come out blurry! Did not like it all!
-1,"Terrible design. These earbuds will not stay in my ears. Tried walking with them but they fell out every couple of steps I took. I looked like a psycho walking down the street holding them in my ears so I never used them on a walk again. They only work for me if I'm sitting perfectly still and remove all the oil from my skin as the rubber covers get extremely slippery if you have the slightest bit of oil on your skin. I gave two stars because the sound quality isn't terrible, but for me these headphones are useless."
1,Screen protector was easy to apply and is cut perfectly for this hard to fit screen. Once applied it's virtually unnoticeable (except for the cutouts for the cameras / mic which are absolutely necessary). Buying another right now.
1,Great case!  A bit of challenge getting the screen cover on without any specs of dust being trapped on it.
-1,Case does not particularly fit snugly. Cutout for the camera misaligned. (This may be the cause of it not fitting properly.). Pretty cheap. Not worth $10.
-1,"DO NOT BUY!!! This charger was connected to my phone one night and for some reason it heated up the USB cable so much that all the plastic melted off the cable and the port ended up warped and melted. Clearly it is missing either basic protection from dangerous conditions such as shorts or there is a major quality control problem. I will never trust this brand to charge my phone safely again, since they almost caught my bedroom on fire!!"
1,The best choice to have
0,"I had been looking at this case for a while and ended up purchasing it on sale during the Amazon sale day.  I have always had an Otterbox and was hoping the quality would be similar.  It's not.  I managed to crack the case the first time I took it off.  The plastic frame is very rigid and brittle.  The plastic is very thin around the ports, and quite easy to break.  The gold color is also wearing off the back corners and showing white.  I've had this case 3 weeks.  I anticipate upgrading to an Otterbox within a month or two."
1,Fits nice a snug on my galaxy s4. I have had it a couple months and it's alot better than I expected.
1,"Very good product, I recommend it 100% guaranteed"
1,"When I first got it and saw all the instructions and steps I thought it was overkill.  When I was done (after following said instructions) I was really glad because I had a fingerprint, lint, dirt and bubble free cover for my phone face.  It looks great and the helpful stickers are reusable."
1,"This kit does not come with the saddle clamps so if your speakers do not have the clamps to connect the speaker to the mount, then you will need to contact customer service at bazooka to get the clamps.  Otherwise, this is a high-quality product at a great price."
1,Easy to use!
1,Works without errors on the phones and ipads
1,Great product !!
1,"This works well.  My Ipad responds quickly.  Arrived as expected, and I'm happy with it."
1,Great! Keep it clean and it always sticks firm.
1,Works great. Charges our phones and tablet very fast.
0,"Broke pretty quickly, have to keep the phone or whatever device pretty close to the actual headphones which is annoying. Recommend a armband thing"
0,"Did not work with Iphone 6; apparently unlike Android phones, Iphone 6 does not support Qi technology.  For it to work I found out it needs an external plug hooked to the Iphone in order to receive the Qi wave."
1,"So, the first thing you'll see when you get this is the heavy plastic box. Not sure if I have much use for it, but its nice and strong. The cable itself is well made, with a slightly rubbery coating on the wire. The lignthing end is shiny black plastic, and narrow enough to fit my case. It works fine on all my computers, and the extra length is nice to have.<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review"
1,VERY GOOD!
1,Perfect charge for iPhone 6 every time
1,Phone doesn't have a flash plus the memory on the phone gets full fast to the point where you can't download anymore apps
1,Love the color and quality. The fast delivery was great!!!
1,Tried my first Android :)
1,Works well he cord is sturdy. Lasted longer than Apple product but still split at the end after a long period of use.
1,Excelente
1,Great price and fast shipping!!
-1,The USB cord is cheap as hell.
1,EXCELENTE
1,Let me start out by saying that I drive a tractor trailer and deliver freight for a living.I've had other Nite Ize cases in the past and loved them but this is the biggest case so far.It lasted a year in a half before becoming unusable but then it was a big case that was constantly being subjected to rubbing the trailer walls as I was trying to get pallets off a trailer so I really can't say anything bad about it.By the way I still have a small Nite Ize case that's still going strong after 5 years.
-1,"These buds fall out of my ears.  I got them to use while running (wireless) so I didn't have a cord to deal with.  I have tried hard to like them but they just don't fit well.  The plastic pieces wear out quickly and they give you one replacement set.  (I'm already using them)  In addition, the documentation for the product is really light.  You can't find a website for them so if you lose the documentation it is a problem.  I had accidentally put mine into Chinese alerts so the alerts weren't in English.  Luckily I still had the documentation from the box.  The battery life is pretty good.<br /><br />I am really bummed I bought these."
-1,Didnt even work
1,Works great for adjusting the angle of my fish finder so that I can see it.
1,Fits perfectly and I love that I could find a clear one so I can see the color of my Ipod.
1,Works 100% as promised in the product description.  Would recomend.
1,Pretty sweet. The only thing is that I have a nokia Lumia 635. It doesn't work with my phone. If someone else found out please tell me thank you!
1,"At this price point I was not expecting this level of quality and was truly impressed. This is primarily made up of metal and has a nice weight which increases the stability of the stand without adding to much bulk. The hole for the cord in the back is a nice feature that help streamline the setup, and the rubberized base protects your electronics. Unfortunately my wife likes it so much I have to get another since she took mine. I have multiple items from this seller and have always received great service, great items and speedy shipping."
1,Fits good
1,Love it! Got it on time and exactly as described
1,Received quickly and grand kids love them!
1,perfect color for my gay personality!
-1,It didn't work
1,works as described. Good follow-up service
1,Excellent item for a very economical price.
1,This is amazing for the price.so many features takes a while to get use to excellent subwoofer control and seperate output for mids amp.equalizer is great and bluetooth
1,"Stays on snug, lightweight, color accurate...."
0,"When I bought this phone I loved it at first but it wasn't long before I changed my mind.  One thing all the other customers haven't informed you about that's a big negative is the fact that it isn't a very durable phone, not that all phones are in the first place, but this one particular wasn't.  I bought a protective rubberized case for mine with a glass protector as well.  When I went to pick my phone up off the desk I fumbled it a couple times in the process and dropped it.  The height was no more than a couple of inches but it was enough to kill the speaker in the back so that I started getting a static like sound out of it when it played and then cut out on me entirely."
-1,"In my understanding, I ordered screen protectors for an LG G2 - which is a 5.2 inch screen. But what arrived in mail was something else. These covers are for a LARGER screen. They're not even for the same phone. They don't fit on my screen at all. Greatly disappointed. I should have just gone to the store instead of ordering this online. Don't waste your money because the only thing they will be good for is filling up space on your shelf."
1,Very nice!
1,"Nice product, feels sturdy, and for a cheap price.."
-1,"Beautiful Case. I ordered the incorrect size. Display shows like it will fit a iPhone 6 plus the new phone, but it doesn't."
1,"The armband is soft and comfortable when worn. The Galaxy Note 5 fits even with the case I have on my phone. The screen is responsive with the plastic cover. I would not recomend using the key holder if the key does not completely slip into the slot, otherwise the key may fall out during your walk or run. Also the openings for the bottom of the phone are not place correctly. The headphone  jack is covered. You can probably put a head set if you stretch the material where the hole is at. If you only use bluetooth headphones then this should not be an issue. Overall, it does the job of holding my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 while I run."
1,The case is perfect I got it for myself but my daughter has the same phone so she claimed it for herself
1,"The phone was sent to Trinidad in the Caribbean  and it's working great...my sister loves it, says it so much simpler to use..now my other sister wants one..."
1,Great phone case.
1,Great 'add on' find!  I bought it as a back-up in case my more expensive version of the same style broke and I've been using it trouble free for a while now so it's also a great value.
1,"Arrived quickly, works well and is quite stylish. Just so you know, the funny little plastic piece connected to the lanyard is designed to plug into the headphone jack to help keep track of the stylus."
1,best BASS for your BUCK.<br /><br />amazing for short work outs where you need that music flowing through your veins for that extra push. BUT if you do longer workouts (2+ hours) the back end of the earbuds (the hard part) tends to irritates the part of the ear that secures the earbud itself from moving.
1,Absolutely amazing. Its very slim and doesn't interfere with any signals. It actually makes my phone seem bigger since its so slim which i love. Beats my otter box any day
1,"Looks nice and fit perfect.  Everything is as expected.  This may not protect iPhone especially when it's dropped, however, I know it before I purchased this item, so not complaining.  The color turned from clear to darker shade after a few months of use, but with darker shade, it still looks good to me."
1,"All you would expect from a top-of-the-line Android phone. I chose the Galaxy 5 over the 6 because I wanted to use my SD card, and I wanted to replace the battery when it gets low of charge. Metro pcs offers a real unlimited data/talk plan (no throttled speed) for $60/mo. I upgraded from the Galaxy S3, and my only complaint is the high price."
1,Does the case fit on the silver edition??
1,"Not really what I expected but as long as you dont drop your phone (and if you constantly drop your phone, you should have a protective case anyway!!!!!) the case works fine. I also have another case that has the same exact shape and is made the exact same way (the only difference is the design on it) but after a while of taking the case on and off the color starts to wear off on the corners, and it starts cracking."
1,Great!
-1,"Junk, belt clip broke within the 2nd week, case fits the phone well"
1,This is a great product.  Easy to install and no bubbles.  Crystal clear.
0,The cushion was ok but I didnt have the over the head band to hold the ear piece to my head.
0,doesnt charge your phone all the way
1,was fine and fit perfectly. was what we were looking for
1,Exactly as described.  Arrived early.
1,so useful tiem and good price!
-1,not what I was looking for
1,worked great and had everything I needed
1,love it! and got here right on time!:)
1,"THIS IS A SUPER GREAT CHARGER SO FAR! I LOVE THE 3 USB PORTS, THE MOST I'VE EVER HAD IS 2! ALMOST EVERYTHING CAN BE CHARGING STUFF IN THE CAR INSTEAD OF FIGHTING OVER TURNS! EVEN THE ADULTS! IT SEEMS TO CHARGE FAST WHICH IS A SUPER PLUS!<br /><br />*DISCLAIMER: I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT FREE OR AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN RETURN FOR MY HONEST REVIEW AFTER USING IT,"
1,Good
-1,This product DOES NOT fit the Samsung Galaxy 5 as indicated! I didn't even use the case for 2 seconds and it's already damaged my phone!<br /><br />CHARGING AREA; Samsung has a water resistant cover for their charging port. The Empire MPERO IMPACT opening is not long enough to allow the samsung charging port cover to open which has caused mine to snap off and break!<br />OUTER BUTTONS; The volume and power buttons do not align properly from case to phone so none of your functions will work.<br />TOO BIG; The entire case is just too big in areas and too small in others...terrible design!
1,Works perfectly for iPhone 5.
1,"This case was great for the 7 or 8 months I had it. However shortly after receiving it, it started to discolor. So keep that in mind when purchasing."
1,"Wonderful right out of store packaging, great quality and overall best brand out there"
1,Same phone with same Color looks good together
1,"I love this case.  It's stylish, cute and with just enough bling."
1,"So I've used screen protectors for as long as I've been having a smartphone, bought one for each of them, at least 7!<br />This is by far the best one, their service is also amazing. I dropped my phone on hard concrete and it saved my screen from cracking.<br />Highly recommended"
1,Loved it!!!! Super Cute
-1,Too bulky. Had to send back
-1,Zero stars why pay $100 for a case that does not protect you device like life proof claims. Bought the case for my 12 yr son iPhone 5s the first time it got knocked into the pool for about 30 seconds the phone was a total loss. Same as if I had not spent $100 on a case. The case leaked in two places top right corner between rubber and screen protector and around charging port cover. Of course life proof stood behind their warranty they offered me a new case for my destroyed iPhone that their product did not protect as claimed. So now I'm out the cost of an iPhone and the cost of a case that DID NOT perform to lifeproof claim.
-1,"Screen still shattered with this case on, save your money"
1,Worked great
1,Just got this for my new iPhone 5s. Came as advertised. I had been using the default screen protector for a week or so. I took it off and applied this as the instructions said and it worked perfectly. No air bubbles at all. Super beautiful and I feel really good about the safety of my screen.
1,I love it yay
1,I love it because it has a good price and a good quality.
0,not the same quailty of what i wanted but this is a moment of you get what you pay for. its not very good for bass just regular toned muisc enough to get by for awhile but deff need to buy a better pair.
1,Great value
-1,This is not a tempered glass screen protector. Seller should stop passing it off as tempered glass it's a cheap plastic at best I'll be sending this back. Buy else where.
0,does not work on all my devices...ie: tablet samsung and motorola verison.
1,Very suitable replacement for the original Samsung battery. Went from pulling barely 1 and 1/2 hours of screen on time back to upwards of 3 and 1/2 to 4 and 1/2 hours screen on time depending on usage.
-1,"Cute,  convenient, inexpensive,  protective ....  BUT doesn't last long.  Had the case  for about 4 weeks when it started looking really worn out and cracking where is bends when you open it. Then after 8 weeks the seems completely ripped through where the wallet part is so it won't hold money or cards. I never overstuffed it or anything.  I'll probably order another because the price is right but as far as quality it definitely doesn't compare to the otterbox wallet case"
1,"Works really well. Love the length, can never go back to the short! I've tried so many non-Apple cords but this one is the best value for money!"
1,Everything is fine. I love Amazon
1,Perfect
1,Love it fits perfect gives great protection looks awesome very happy with my purchase.
-1,The case is slipping from the holder it came with.
1,Great speaker
1,I absolutely love this case.  Very girly but sophisticated.
0,just a bad as my old battery; but better
1,I have now purchased 2 of these. This is a very durable product. I have dropped alot of things on my screen and the product has not failed.
1,battery on phone does not last as long as i hope
1,"Looks great, fit very well. Happy with the product."
1,bought in purple and loved it so much bought another for mother in law
0,Dropped it on the first day and broke the clip on back.
0,The phone is very basic as you would expect but the built in TV tuner is useless. It's a Analog TV. You'll be lucky if you could even find one watchable channels.
1,"Works well.  Fast shipping.  Some static experienced, but that is a result of driving in the city."
-1,I have 5 of these and have loved them. One of mine that I bought on April 2 wont let me fully charged it. I hope this is a glitch/defect and all my others keep working. I wish I could return this one.
1,Excellent quality case.  Exactly what I was looking for...a clear case to protect entire phone from scratches but without adding to the size of the phone.  Just make sure you put the case on perfect because any areas that do not completely adhere to the phone will cause problems once dirt gets under it.  Would definitely buy again!
-1,"Great seller but the quality of this ACEPower Cord leaves much to be desired. Have had it for 2 1/2 months and it finally stopped charging. Have been using it on my iPad since mid June. It worked well at the start although it was a bit difficult to fit into the charging area. It was almost as if the pin connector was a little too wide. After a couple weeks it started to fit easier but then the rubber coating over the wires broke where it meets the pin connector. Since July, it intermittently would not charge when plugged in. It finally gave out today. I've tried running Hard Resets, using other Power Adapters, and 30 Pin to USB cords and have found this ACEPower Cord to be at fault. My electronics are always well taken care of too. The only good feature is the length...it's 10 feet long. You may want to avoid the hastle and cost of purchasing this inferior product only to have to spend more on a better quality Apple product. I learned my lesson."
-1,"My iPhone 5c in a Speck case is still too small to fit into the mount, and falls out frequently. It also does not stay straight up in my air vents. I wish I would have returned this for another one, because I am not impressed."
-1,Not even worth one star!  Did not work straight from the package.
1,Phone can only sit one way which I didn't realize. It is small and easy to transport and does work. Bendable and made easy to position to how you want it positioned. Actually quite convent to use.
1,"Great case.  The only thing I wish it had had was something silicone to get a better grip of the surface, and a slightly raised front face so when you lay the phone down the screen down't touch the surface of whatever it is on.  Other than that, great case.  Very cute."
1,was not for the iphone 5s either
1,The best universal car mount holder I've ever used. Stable and sturdy one
1,Wish it had inside pocket
1,"As soon as I put it on, my phone feels protected while looking stylish. The buttons are a little hard to press but you'll get used to it. Loved that this was only 9$. And yes people it does protect the protruding camera. I feel my phone is better protected now because of this case and I have a tempered glass screen on it. Awesome :). I got mine in blue"
1,The screen protector is really thin and flimsy. Thought it would have been more than just a piece of plastic protecting the screen. But overall good case.
1,LOVE this speaker! The battery lasts forever and its actually pretty loud. It's very light weight and easy to store away when you are finished with it. I definitely recommend this speaker to other buyers!
1,its my second moto phone last phone died in water.<br />its an awesome phone and worth money.<br />as soon i got the phone got my updates i wanted it for 4g LTE and it worked seamlessly.<br />i am not much game addict but game i play like injustice and angry birds were running as expected so its goood.<br />thanks moto
1,Works well.
1,Can't beat the price for such a high-quality product.
1,Just what I was looking for.
1,Perfect for taking on trips cause u don't need a wallet.<br />There's room for cash and a credit card..it's a.nice sturdy case. .
1,"Bought one of these and this model for my husband because I already had one and liked its performance, for the most part.  Wish it had caller ID feature but can't have it all.  He likes it just fine; uses it mainly for driving.  Mine is attached to my ear it seems sometimes.  Thank you for a good product and a good price point."
1,Nice
-1,"It was awful, I had to charge my phone 4 times a day."
1,"Great case!  Fits my phone perfectly, protects the screen, looks and feels like expensive leather...I love it!  This is the second Juicy Case I've purchased, previously owned one for my LG G3.  I love that you can see who's calling, answer calls take photos, and more without opening the case. The stand feature works perfectly both horizontally and vertically when you I need to work hands-free.  There are lots more great features, but in summary, it's the perfect case for me.  I highly recommend!"
-1,Not an accurate description...  they are transparent and flimsy
1,"Nice case,  snug fit"
-1,back part snapped off
1,Good unit...big advantage is the retractable cord.
1,Work great but can't connect to my ipod nano 7th gen
-1,Have only had it for 2 months and the strap has broken off and the colors have dulled considerably. Did not last long at all!!!
0,Not exactly what I was looking for.
1,it charges fast
1,Excellent product and customer service -- I highly recommend this provider!
1,great suction
1,Great price and work great
1,After getting one of the brand's other product and decided to get another because of the good experience. This is a good product that give it a good boast. I use it every time I am on vacation or hiking. Give it a shoot.
1,This thing is amazing. Charges my phone real fast.
1,"I love how pretty this case is.  My phone feels protected.  The kick stand seems a little weak, but I can live with that.  Easy to put on & feels good in my hand."
1,Very impressed with product.  Super easy to attach to my LG G4 and so much brighter than the plastic protectors I've used before.<br /><br />Great experience
1,"I've been using this case for a year and a half now. I will use slim armor on every phone from here on out. It is the perfect size for my hand (adult male) and it's taken a beating but still looks and works great.<br /><br />The fit was perfect for my LG G2. No issues with speaker quality or camera quality with my case on.<br /><br />The double layer case provides a lot of protection. I've dropped my phone several times (from desks, from my pocket, from my ear)...no damage. The case is hardly even scratched after a year an a half of use. The color hasn't even started to fade or wear and all the plastic pieces still fit tight.<br /><br />I take the case off and clean my phone and the case fairly often but not a lot of dirt is allowed behind my phone with this case on (less than other cases I've had).<br /><br />I'm not sure if Slim Armor was available for my other smart phones in the past but I'll make sure it is in the future."
1,A slight difference of performance but my iPhone works better now
1,Excellent protection for my phone. Trident makes one of the toughest cases on the planet.
1,"This item is highly recommended and not only for the shower but for us older people it can be used as a speaker, you can lay down and have it on and talk without holding your phone and once you finish taking play some music if you like. It sticks to surfaces with a suction cup which is awesome. Have purchased at least four now as gifts."
1,Very happy with purchase!
-1,They just sound flat. Replace 7 years old stock JBL 6x9s in my boat and the old JBL's sounded better.  Purchased based on strong reviews but I can't recommend. Thinking about pulling them back out and trying something different. Disappointed.  Glad everyone else likes them.
1,Pros: The case was easy to install and fits my iPhone 6 great and I love the color. The screen proctor goes on with fairly easy with just a little effort to get all the air bubbles out. Cons: the back of the case is very slick and easily slides out of your hand especially when using the phone one handed. The port to access the silence mode on and off switch on the side of the case is quite deep and somewhat difficult to reach and operate especially if you do not have long finger nails. I have not dropped the phone in the case to test its durability but over all it's a decent case for the price range it is in.
-1,"The battery works fine, but I am still disappointed with the seller.  I accidentally ordered two of these batteries and the seller would not take back the extra and refund my payment. Now, by the time the first battery wears out the second will probably not be viable anyway."
-1,These products work for a bit then stop working. The seller is also not responsive to feedback. Do not buy!!!
1,Works fine
1,good product
1,This is great and so easy to use!  I keep it permanently attached in my car.
1,Best price and good quality
1,good job
-1,"Broke after 2 weeks of general use. Otherwise, this was the best case I ever used. I love the grip on the back, and it was very sleek. Even came with a free screen protector. I wish it didn't break tho :-("
1,It works.
1,Strong and looks good
1,"The sound is great for such a small speaker. It attaches easily and it doesn't get in the way. The controls could be a little more tactile (I have to stop and look at it to adjust the volume) but that's a minor complaint, all things considered."
1,Authentic nice awesome
1,great slim case.
1,I received a discount on my order for a fair review
1,Works good the only issue I have is the mute button on the headphones it does not match up with my Cisco soft phone on my PC. When I am on mute on the Cisco soft phone and unmute it from the Cisco softphone the mute stays on the headphones.Other than that they are very clear.
1,Excelente
-1,"I've gotten two of these, rated at 100,000 ma.  While they will take a charge from the usb cord, they will NOT accept a charge from the solar panel, which is why i bought them to begin with.  Got a refund on both.  Get a regular battery backup, it's cheaper, and actually works as purported"
-1,I tried this product out and immediately returned it.  The sound was very distorted. The headphones play an on off audio message when the user turns them on or off.  The play back of the audio message was also very distorted.
1,Awesome product. Gives the apple watch a sportier look with some added protection
1,it works
1,"I've had this charger for about 8 months now, and I am here to tell you, it is fantastic! It works well on my Nexus 6 with a dual layer case. Just set it down, and click, it's charging away!<br /><br />The only thing that been slightly odd over these months, is that sometimes when I take the phone off of the charger, the blue light will stay lit. I have mine connected to a power strip that has a switch, so I just do a quick off & back on with it, and the blue charging light stays off."
0,"Seems OK, but have not used it yet.  Rather bulky."
-1,This fell apart after about 2 month of use. It says lifetime warranty but I have not been able to return this item.
1,"Not just colorful, but it works....great price"
1,Nice case for the money
-1,Didnt came with the pink case offered. 1 week of use and the screen go bad damaged with strips.
1,"works fine, good price. no problems."
1,Wow!  FAST charging time.  Seems like a high quality product.
1,Like this cellphone!
1,"Fits perfectly, and the instruction were easy to follow. Got the film on within 5 minutes."
1,"I've had this Bluetooth transmitter for a couple of months now and has yet to fail. I use it everyday, and always works flawless. A great addition to your car if you have an older model vehicle that doesn't have AUX or Bluetooth. It comes with a 2.5 V USB adapter which enables you to charge tablets/iPads. I use this transmitter with an iPhone and have no compatibility issues, it even charges my iPhone to 100% charge in less than an hour."
1,You can't beat the fact that for less than 30 bucks you can have a dual band HT. It does what its supposed to. Its no Yaesu but its $30!! If you drop it or loose it... NBD... a disposable HT!
-1,Phone case is beautiful but the paint keeps falling off and it just doesn't look good anymore I'm very upset with this. DO NOT BUY
1,EXCELENTE
1,"Very thin and decent coverage of curved edges of the iPhone.  But, bubbles at edges, visible mostly with black faced phones, hardly visible with white, but still there.  First one is inevitably for practice that you won't like and will remove so, if it's your first purchase, it's really buying a single screen protector.  Not sure how long it'll last, and worried about the bubbles at the edges catching dust or pulling off the screen."
1,"If it falls on its back or side it will be ok,  but it definitely does not have raised edges to keep the screen from touching the ground. The screen jets out pretty far past the case so it's really only half protected it it drops."
-1,The case was great for charging my phone. But when I dropped my phone - the screen cracked. Now I use an otter box and carry a charger with me.
1,Pretty decent phone for the price
1,muy bien
1,So so very happy with this screen protector! It was the second brand I ordered because the first one I got was terrible and was promptly sent back.  This protector was the easiest one I have ever applied and it looks great! Thank you!
1,great
1,Nice soft gel and fit perfectly.
1,"I just had to replace my Motorola Bluetooth after several years of use, and got the same model because I like it so much.  It is easy to use and has great clarity."
-1,"This case was a very tight fit for my phone which in return messed up my display, the people at Sprint said for me to take it off because it was also causing it to over heat."
1,"Looks great, well made worth the money."
-1,Item started smoking after use for a couple of months.
-1,"Worst case ever! I was using my selfie stick with the case on. I thought it wouldn't break so I was like whatever. So when it fell of my selfie stick and I saw it cracked, I was in tears!!"
1,"Great lightweight but protective case!  I usually don't like cases, since they seem to make the phone feel too bulky, but after I dropped (and broke) my old Moto X (with no case), I thought it would be a good time to buy a case.  This works well while staying out of the way. Thanks!"
1,The jetpack works great. I was disappointed with usb cord.  It was a cheap cord; got hot when used to charge so I got a better one.
1,Earbuds are better than expected
1,At first I couldn't get it to fit my phone but it turned out alright in the end.
1,"Thank , I really liked , shipping was fast ."
-1,It broke within a week. Will not be ordering from them again.
-1,"case broke almost immediately, ruining the waterproof aspect of it.  Would not buy again."
1,Love my selfie stick!  It got here amazingly fast and it is great value.  Major extension and simple to use... no app necessary.
1,nice
1,"Got this case for my sister, this is her review<br />&#34;My LG G3 came with the circle cutout flip case but I wanted something with real edges to protect the screen. This case is both functional and looks great. I've had it for a month now. I've dropped my phone on the corners, on its back, and face forward and the phone is unscathed. The back does scratch but it doesn't subtract from the overall aesthetic and what is a case for anyway. It's easy to put on the phone but harder to take off(I couldn't get it off until about a month after I got it). That's not a bad thing because I had another case that got super loose within a few months. The case also provides great grip for this slippery phone. The holes are perfectly sized I can fit all my cables into their ports and still use the infrared laser for the remote. The case makes the phone a fraction of a centimeter wider but it's barely noticeable. I got the gold version of this and I was a little worried how it would look but it's a subtle car gold and I've gotten tons of compliments on the color and overall design. I really like it, would recommend.&#34;"
0,Easy setup
-1,4 months later all of the cords are in the trash. Also way too short
0,"These USB cables are very cool, but they're not apple certified so they don't link up with the iPhone quite right.  I have to push it in hard to get it to work, sometimes walking away thinking its charging but its not.  They are a little finicky, requiring a bit more attention when using them, but they do work."
1,Great!! Able to use all my old 4s cords with this!😉👍🏾👌🏾
1,Great product! Just as described.
1,Useful
1,i like that they cover the entire screen.
1,Very good. good seller.
1,Case is weakest performer. Rubber coating tends to come off with use. Charger works good. Have not used the clear film as screen protectors as mine are still good.
1,It's great having an extra long charger cord.
1,I just started using my solar charger on my bike rides. It hold the charge throughout my ride.  Throughout my ride  I also use map my ride and play pandora.  38 miles today.
1,I really like the case it fits my phone perfectly.
1,Works very well and seems very protective but I don't like how slick the hard part of the cases in my hand
1,Excellent I must say! I bought it for my 13 year old son and he loves it too.
1,Good cover for the fish finder. Works as expected.
1,does the trick I like it time will tell
-1,Do not order these. They are useless.

0,"Love this case, just wish is didn't start to show dirt to quickly."
-1,"I bought this last month. Used it one time, SHORTLY! I plug it into my iphone today and it doesn't even work! Very disappointed and it cannot be returned or even exchanged for a new one, because the return window just ended (of course it did). What a waste of money!"
0,Having to by another set as these came apart.  Didn't last as long as I was oping.
1,Nice product
1,Very cute snap on case with all the great lines from Fault In Our Stars. No image smudging or off center placements. Really cute case and I always get compliments
1,the small loop is too small -- the large loop is a fraction too big. guess i need to work on those biceps.<br />holds the phone and key securely and keeps both dry despite rain and profuse perspiration.
1,My daughter loves the protection this case gives her.
-1,"Phone says it is not authenic, fake, knock off!"
0,"It arrived a day early which was nice because I had it for my birthday. However, the battery life is subpar. It dies quite a bit faster than any other phone I have had except for my old Blackberry Curve. Every day I go to work, and during that time my phone is in my purse so it doesn't get used till about four in the evening- some days it's fine and I come back and the phone is still charged and there's no problem, but most days I come back and it has somehow drained half the battery by just sitting unused in my purse. It came new in box (or at least it seemed to?) so I am unsure as to why this is, but really for 200$ I did expect better. It's still a good phone, and it should last me a while, so overall I'd still say it was worthwhile, just don't order this expecting it to be perfect."
1,"I ordered this for my dad and he loved it 😊 , fits his phone perfectly and came in quick . Good Quality 👌🏽"
-1,I'm returning it for a refund because it wouldn'the fit the tablet. I made sure I put in all the information on the Samsung Galaxy tablet 8&#34; and it didn't come close to fitting it on the width. I was very disappointed because this was for my grandson's birthday present.
1,Excelente
1,Very good.
1,Excellent product! Love it😄
1,"what i expected, keeps scratches away but wont really be protected if it falls although its not a snap on so the cover stays on. great fit."
1,good
1,"Love it, very light."
1,"I had some issues with my original unit but after seeing my old review they sent me a new one at no cost. The new one works great on all my devices. Completely satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it. Below is my old review for the defective product they promtely replaced.<br /><br />&#34;It's Decent but not compatible with everything. It worked okay with my Samsung but not my Sony.<br /><br />Since it uses the USB and it's IQ adaptive system it doesn't work with a lot of phone docks like Sony which charges by a magnetic strip. Since there are no ports that are not part of the IQ system there is no way to get Sony products to work with this using the Magnetic Charger.<br /><br />Second. I haven't owned this that long and all ready I have had some ports malfunction. The top port for example does not always work, You plug something into it and nothing happens no charging at all.&#34;"
1,perfect!  I've used this for about 2 months now and still grips like a champ!
1,I admit it. I'm a phone dropper. I probably drop my phone at least 3 times a day and this case has yet to let damage happen to my phone. So if this case is able to stand the test of my tendecies then I guess it most be a pretty awesome case.
1,"Nice solid case, would recommend.  Comes with a screen protector as well."
1,"The first thing I noticed about this charger is that it has a very solid feel to it. Being waterproof, it only has a couple seals to cover up the ports which means less parts that could potentially break."
1,Stickers are the perfect size and have not peeled off like one would expect. Are extremely responsive and ive even accidentally spilled juice on a sticker that i have on a nightstand and it still functions.
1,Awesome case! Just wish it gave u the option to buy without the built in screen so I can put an HD screen on it instead of the crappy plastic it comes with. I dropped it over 20x's already & my phone is still in perfect condition!!
1,Gets the job done but the rubber parts ware and eventually become detached if you're not careful.  Fully water proof though!
1,Works perfectly to protect my phone!
1,"Quality screen protectors, priced right."
1,Love this product.
1,"Wow! What a difference this battery case makes! Took it out of the package today and put it on my IPhone6. Ended up being in class for 8 hours (and we all know what you do in class). Came out of class and had a full charge! Will be great for trips, sporting events, and times when I can't plug in. It does make the phone a little heavier (obviously) but not so much that it would affect my decision to buy.  * I received a discount as a product reviewer but this has not affected the authenticity of my review."
1,good price and on time
1,Love the case for its design and durability.
-1,These suck. Didn't even stick to my screen.
0,The case came in very quickly and is even cuter n person but it fits so snug that have not been able to remove it.
1,"This appears to be a very high-quality charging/transfer cable.  Everything is smooth and solid, fits well in the ports.  I bought it to replace one the cats chewed through during a lightning storm awhile back, I think there's a good chance this one will resist such treatment and survive.  Have to give a shout out to whoever designed the packaging, it's fabulous.  Quite welcoming, looks like it has nice jewelry inside, and customer service info is right there, easy to find, should there be a problem."
1,"It was a little hard to get on but after I got it on, it serves the purpose."
1,"I am always dropping my phone. The other day I dropped it from a 3 story stair case. When I got to my phone, it was laying face down. I picked it up and it was just fine. A few scratches but other than that it was fine!!"
1,Product was perfect
1,These are inexpensive and they work great. I love them. They last the length of the phone.
1,A surprisingly good case at an excellent value price.
1,That last star could be had if only there was an opening that allowed the light sensor to adjust the brightness automatically. It's the only flaw I see. The elastic band is wide and fits my arm well. I have 19&#34; biceps and I don't have to adjust it open very much. On the smallest setting it fits around a medium sized water bottle and doesn't fall off. (For my arm exercises that make an arm band impractical). Overall it's a winner.
1,"Works well, but sound is soft. Very easy to use."
1,"Awesome Case! Fits Well And I Love It, 5 Stars!"
1,Product works great with my phone.  I'm a little disappointed with the stand capability. I have to lean it against something to keep it in the correct position.
1,Nice phone
1,"I absolutely love these. I have really weird shaped ear canals apparently as essentially no ear bud will stay in my ears. These, however, do. And they're comfortable. Which is a definite first for me. I wear them while working out and never have to worry about adjusting them. Sound is awesome as well. And I LOVE the fact they're Bluetooth. No more forgetting your earphones are plugged into your phone and dancing around your kitchen and watching your precious piece of technology fall to the floor (not that I've ever DONE that...;) lol) even better, I can leave my phone plugged in in the living room and still listen to music while cooking. The ONLY thing I could possibly gripe about, and that's rather petty, I have a small head so the band on the back doesn't fit snug to my head. but once on I normally don't even notice it."
1,"Excellent cellphone for people who uses the phone for WhatsApp, facebook and call and send messages."
1,This product works just great with my Apple Watch. I'm really happy about how well the watch attached to the Spigen and how reliable it has been. The only question I have is whether the stick-on base for the Spigen is reusable so I could bring along the stand when I travel
1,"My daughter recommended this case, and it is as tough as she advised."
1,Works as expected.
1,Best wireless charger I've ever used.
1,helps keep me on track with daily walking. had to go online to figure out how to work it though
1,Great case for our families purposes.  Not the &#34;tank model&#34; case protector but for the price this is a must get!
1,I love it!
1,First let me start by saying YOU CAN JUST REPLACE THE GLASS !! Now with that being said. If you have the time and the patients it can be done Please take your time removing the glass from the LCD. You will need a good hair dryer or a heat gun be very careful heating the glass to loosen the adhesive from the lcd. Also watch some YouTube videos and do your homework before attempting this repair. I actually removed the glass myself and then took the replacement part to a cell phone repair guy at my local flea market and paid him 20$ to install the glass for me. (Took him about 30 min) but that is a lot cheaper than the $100 to $200 that everyone else quoted me to do this repair. Also if you do attemp to install the new glass and digitizer be very careful not to break the digitizer!!!! It is very fragile  But if you do break the digitizer or cable. There is an app you can install on your phone to bypass these keys. So good luck and TAKE YOUR TIME !!!!!!!  Maybe something I said will be helpful This is my first review and the first time I've ever worked on a cell phone !!  Would have gave it 5 stars but no instructions  I also just purchased another kit to repair my phone  the first one was for my wife's
1,"Great product, fast shipping!"
1,This was an excellent amp and still works now. It provides some really good base and even better we bought this at an excellent price. I wish they were still available I would definitely buy another for my other car.
0,Thought I was getting 2&#34; pads. Will keep these but need the larger pads.
1,Great TPU case fits perfectly.  The back is a little bit more slick than the all clear TPU cases but it won't show the scratches like the all clear TPU cases do.  Very similar to Belkin's Grip Candy but on this one the sides have little bumps making it easier to hold.
1,Particularly like my green kettle!
1,I love it!
1,"I always put a screen protector on my cell phone as soon as I get it. I like this one very much. I use a swype type keyboard and this helps to let my finger glide over screen very fast. You really can't notice it's there. If you follow directions, it's very easy to install this. In my case I had the screen protector before my new phone arrived. I highly recommend this. I know so many people with scratched or cracked screens and I'm doing what I can to not be one of them."
1,Works great
1,"Super bright ends, works good. The ends are way too bright and the cord lights you can barely see. For the price they are awesome!"
1,"It awakened me to the ease of using my Kindle, which I use frequently daily, and this product is easy, foldable to take along, and easy to use, I love it."
1,I bought this almost a year ago and my phone hasn't been scratched at all. Which is pretty impressive because I drop it all the time. It's coming apart now but it lasted a while! Would recommend.
1,Sturdy case.  My husband loves it.
1,"I broke the ear hook on my Motorola Whisper, this fits great, locking into place on the earpiece.  Will order a new one when this one eventually wears out."
1,Great product! Just as described.
1,Used on vacation and got some awesome underwater pics.  Video's were cool too.  Phones stayed dry in the case.
-1,"This charger absolutely does NOT fit the Galaxy S4 battery. I bought it without reading the reviews, and regret the lost $5.99."
1,Very nice
1,"So far so good ,like it"
0,Works well no problems
1,It worked great glad I ordered it
1,"A good case, but if you put 5 or more bills in the bill pocket it gets hard to close."
1,"Overall, I really like the band and seeing my steps thru the day is a great way to focus more on my fitness.  I am not sure that the sleep measurement is accurate.  Also, I hit the band on things sometimes due to being a little tall."
1,These are high quality. Remember that on all newer cars with factory alarms/keys that have transmitters within the key. You will need a bypass module. Evo All is my choice for high quality. Made in Canada. Take your time to install neatly and you will be very happy.
1,I love these ear buds. The sound quality is amazing. They are easy to switch from music to phone and fit my ear canals nicely. I will definitely use them for many years to come. I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
1,"Attractive, eye catching design which still allows full view of the apple logo."
1,This case is the best and very durable.
1,Just right
1,EXCELENT
1,Good product!
1,"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
-1,"We bought the protector for Iphone 6 plus. The screen still broke, even though the protector was on it, so its hardly of any use. I would not recommend this product.."
1,AWESOME PRODUCT!
1,Great product.  Works well with my lifeproof 6 case.
1,"Works wonderful, will purchase again."
1,"Luv this case,  arrived quickly & fit my note 4 perfectly"
1,I like the fact you can charge two phones at once I also like the color on this so you know it's yours this is a charger I will always keep with me to save time.PS. I need a few more great gifts
1,Arrived on time. Came in a small package with the lens that were in the advertisement. works great with my iPhone.
1,Excellent case love it!
1,"Very great buy!!!! Its definitely something worth investing in,plus an extra battery. Now my phone rarely ever dies (unless I leave my extra battery at home...lol). I travel out of town a lot,so whenever I do, I put one of the batteries on this to charge over night, then charge my phone,& simply grab it on my way out the door & place it in my pocket so I'll have it with me whenever I need it throughout the day. And it stays fully charged all day without me having to put it back on the charger."
1,works as it should. A little bothering is that I have to remove a cover before plugging it in.
1,"I purchased one of these recently in anticipation of a Europe trip.  I didn't plan especially well and the unit showed up just two days before we left.  Unfortunately it wasn't manufactured properly and the connector receptacles didn't align properly with the case so that I couldn't get the charge connector in.  I knew that I didn't have time to return it and get a new one prior to my trip so I did some manual rework of the unit with a screwdriver so that the connector fit (but just barely).  I had heard good things about Anker but this unit was definitely made poorly and I was left with a barely functional unit that has disappointed me.  Update - After the review above where I originally gave the product 2 stars, I was contacted by Anker customer service and offered a replacement unit.  I took them up on the offer and it arrived a few days later.  I am still disappointed by the need to get a replacement but very impressed that they dealt with the issue so quickly and with so little extra work on my part.  Thanks Anker."
1,"Good casing i like it. good quality and it fits my iphone 6. the casing is good quality and I am glad i got this product. I really like it. I really recommend the product and it is money worth it. Good condition, good packaging. I Got this with a good price discount during promotional product in exchange of unbiased and honest reiews."
1,Bluetooth does not always connect automatically when I get in the car and I have to tinker with it for awhile to get it too work.
1,"Works great! Didn't end up keeping it because I found it pointless, but it's a cool product for the right people."
1,"It fits right, but maybe I need to wear it in because one side sometimes pops open all by it's lonesome. I believe it's working together with the elements to self sabotage. Maybe it doesn't like the fact it's a gold tab on a silver bezel."
1,Can't keep the corners down on the product. But this is most likely something I did wrong on installation
1,excellent product
1,"Fits well, makes black phone easier to find, and has protected against a couple of drops."
-1,Replaced following instructions on line.  Wireless very carefully.  However glass cracked one week after replaced.  Suspect glass was damaged by not to the eye.
1,Not willing to test the bulletproof feature. Lol!! Awesome screen protector. You get instructions on applying this to your phone. Not sure on taking this off. Scratch resistant and good fitting. Allows for using phone cases.
1,all right
1,Purchased for my wife and she love's it!!!
1,Love it
-1,NOT VERY QUICK RESPONDING. BATTERY LIFE IS BAD AND CALLS SOUND BAD HAD TO RETURN THE PHONE.
1,"Love my new base, got it right before I was to start my new driving job for the school and its been a full month and its not budged at all moves around when I need it to and withstands all my putting my phone in it and out of it, I have an Iphone 6 Plus with a bulky case on it and it does not move the whole time I'm driving!"
1,these were better than I expected and have proven very reliable I would buy this item again
0,"This article has a very good sound quality but for making or receiving calls, the person in the other side of the line doesn't listen to me then, I have to turn off my zivigo bluetooth in order to attend my call correctly… that's why I only give 3 stars to this item"
1,"love it, what a great value"
1,Works great. No problems at all. Very sturdy design. I would give it 5 if they expand their designs. I don't love the design but it was the best of the options.
0,One Controller was damaged.
1,One of the best peices of insurance my iPhone could have. I am a rough and tough biker and my phone is my lifeline. I have worn out my first otter box.  This is my second and surely not my last. I recommend this product over any of the other manufacturers available.  Be sure ur ordering a true otter box and not a knock off.
1,"This band works as described. It fits well and is easy to put on. It's best if you use the safety bands that can be purchased separately in case you get your watch band caught on something, then it won't go flying off."
1,Great lenses 10/10
1,"Fit just like it should, the black matte color makes the phone more classy & easier to hold."
1,"i bought this when traveling Europe , it performed with excellance ."
1,It was wonderful
1,Item as specified.
1,"Works as advertised.  Convenient, light weight and accurate. Wish I could save music to the watch, but I knew that wasn't a feature at purchase.  Ideal for a beginning runner."
-1,Broke the first day. Cheap cheap cheap
1,I use this piece with the mountek magnet it does the job pretty well but I wish they can provide an extra sided tape with it
1,Charger works well and and arrived on time
-1,Worst phone ive ever bought.straight out of the box the headphone jack never worked. after a few months of owning it the cheap battery's life span is less than half as good as it was out of the box. I ordered the wrong version with our knowing so it always has connectivity issues on tmobiles prepaid network and always drops calls and texts never gets through. Now when i barely touch the screen the picture on the screen warps and discolors out of nowhere!!!! If your looking for a cheap phone thats really good try the asus zenphone and avoid this terrible unsupportivte company at all costs.
1,"Took this to the beach last week hoping to get some nice shots of our daughters first time in the ocean. I have the 6 and my wife has the 6 Plus. Usually I will NOT take phones to the beach because sand can do a number on your phone. Thanks to Levin I had both my 6 and 6 Plus protected from the sand and even the water. I took my phone into the water and my wife wanted some underwater shots of her and my daughters feet in the sand. I dunked the Levin down underwater and was able to snap some great photos using the volume rocker button which this case gives you access to.<br /><br />All the pictures came out clear which was wonderful. One thing I did notice however was when you pulled the phone out of the water there was some slight condensation around the camera lens area, this may have been due to the fact that the water was in the high 70s but the outside heat index was 105*. This quickly disappeared and caused no issues for the phones. I appreciate the built in area for a wrist strap as well. It makes me feel a little more secure when using this around water incase it slipped from my hands.<br /><br />The screen itself is also covered with some plastic layer, It was a little difficult to type on at first but we were able to get the hang of it quickly.<br /><br />Charging the device was a bit of an issue, we had some after market cables with us who's connector heads were thicker then OEM cables. They couldn't fit inside the cut out so the phone had to be removed from the case. Upon returning home I tested charging with OEM cable and they fit perfectly.<br /><br />Overall I had a very positive experience with this. I can't knock the whole charging issue because Levin isn't going to make it to spec for every cable company.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes"
-1,Pretty and everything but didn't fit like expected :/ kind of big.
1,"Overall I am content with this case/holster as this was the first one made available on the market that I could find.  It protects the phone, comes with a screen protector, and has a holster to keep the phone out of my pocket.  My previous phone cover made it really hard to power the phone on/off but this one actually makes it easier than with the cover off!  I have dropped my phone a few times with this cover on and it has easily survived the falls with no damage to the phone or the case.<br /><br />My issues with the unit is the overall quality is not where I had hoped it would be.  The belt clip is not very strong and was not tight from the factory, wiggling from side to side.  The material inside the holster was not centered and was outside of the recess that was made for it, so it has started to come off.  The rubber shell on the phone drags on the holster and is causing the case to pull off the bottom of the phone.<br /><br />The issues are minor enough that I still like this overall but I know I will have to buy another one in a year or so.  Considering the cost I'm okay with that."
-1,Worked well at first. After a month the audio started not sounding as good. Now its ao bad its not worth using 6 months in.
1,"Inexpensive, nice unit for daily driver."
1,Excellent
-1,Instructions where wrong. Had to look up how to do it myself. Only worked for a week and now the remote won't even turn on. I've tried new batteries and making sure the connections weren't obstructed. Nothing works. Had to disarm my truck manually. Do not buy! Worse buy ever
1,"This works really well as a dual amp charger. It charges my iPod Touch faster than a regular charger. I have had this for quite a while and it has helped me wonderful. However I have started noticing that when I am plugged in with this the screen on my iPod  starts to malfunction slightly (Not respond correctly). I liked this charger but I read online that third party chargers could have something to do with that. I'll probably get a better one, but for other purposes this will work fine"
1,"worked well, but I wished it had a longer cable than 6 ft."
1,Great color and protection
1,"nice product for a quick charge when no access to electricity.  Beach, long bike rides, etc. Don't be left without cell phone power !!"
1,"On time, work perfectly out of the box, friends say sounds great."
1,A really nice looking cable that works great. I got if for my daughter. She loves the color blue. She used it for her Samsung s5. The cable has a nice feeling and a nice bright blue color. It looks like it will last a very long time.<br /><br />The USB cable is reinforce specially where cables tend to break easy. So that's a plus. It also works with the computer it syncs from computer to cellphone without any problem. Very well made it is durable and I know it will be in used for a very long time.<br /><br />I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.
1,"This is a very good minimalist case. Be sure you are ready for minimalist, though, because it is very thin and light. It has a good fit, and you get a good grip with it. As long as you go in with the right expectations, this case is a winner. And the purple color is fun, too. I've owned several elago brand cases and have not been disappointed with any of them."
1,"Bought this to use in a cruise ship and it worked perfectly. I could charge my iPhone, Fitbit, and iPad pretty quickly. It is light weight and the plug folds in to save space."
0,"It kept my phone screen from breaking, but this glass broke very easily"
-1,Phone sucks
-1,It cuts in out when I'm talking people.
1,This case has saved my phone!
1,Sexy case that hug the phone snug. Does not take the appeal of the device away.
1,"I've recently have built my own custom computer and I have a preferred keyboard that only connects via bluetooth and I didn't have an adapter installed within the software, and I've come across this little jewel. The procedure is simple really. If you have a Windows 7 or 8 you're going to need to download the driver before you can even utilize this device. If you have a Windows 10, the driver that comes along with it will bug out a bit, so you'd have to install the SB340 Driver from either their website or from the CD they've kindly included in the packaging. 1) Plug in SoundBot SB340 in your USB port. 2) Install the driver 3) utilize the GUI within your task bar 4) follow the instructions on pairing the device 5) you're done!  This little jewel is just simple. Effective. and Great! Not only does it just connect 1 device, but it also connects up to how many you want.  This is a great buy and I would recommend to anyone who is looking to buy a Bluetooth adapter."
1,was a gift and was great.No more looking for empty spot.
-1,The product description  intimated that the closure was secured by velcro.  I bought this product because I didn't want a magnet to close and secure the ipod case.  As it turns out the case is secured by a magnet.  Bummer
-1,"This is the lousiest transmitter I've ever bought.  Battery life is very short, and it doesn't pick up even the best stations.  Very fuzzy music.  Wish I hadn't thrown my paperwork away, Id return it."
1,es como se esperaba.
1,These are so chic and love the gold accents in all the right places. They are sleek and James Bondish. I would have given 5 stars but I'm unable to use in my car to hook up with USB plug in and won't work with Bose speaker UNLESS you take off case... Total bummer but I still love the case. But all they need to do is make the hole bigger and voila !! It's perfection!!
1,bueno!
1,Once in a great while you come across a product that is so well thought out and so well designed as this one!  From the easy video to the versatile mounting options it is excellent!  We bought 2 and the same day ordered 3 more for our kids.  Great job!
-1,This is not 4 gauge.  4 guage has a conductor diameter of roughly 0.232 in.  This has a diameter of about 0.199  which is almost 6 gauge.  Go with XS power 4 guage.  It isn't much more expensive and is good quality.  Theirs measures at around 0.261
1,"The generic wireless charging plate does the job, the only thing is that you should center your phone in order it charges property, but for the price you can't go wrong, and the delivery was really fast."
0,Had it for 2 weeks and already cracked and broken. Dissapointing
1,"The product is functions very well as a charger. The LED indicator remains blue for any device that is not Quick Change 2 compliant and turns green if it is a Quick Change compliant device (operating at a higher voltage than the traditional 5v in USB devices). I like this ability as not many charger have it.  The only complaint I have is that the plastic opening surrounding the port is very small and tight. In fact, when I first got the device my USB cables would not even go in. I have to really force them in gently by wedging the connector in to carefully expanded the size of the plastic opening to the port. I don't know if this is just my unit or just typical of this model. The USB port is still a bit inconvenient to use and take more effort that what should be to plug in a USB connector.  Most Anker products are exceptional, I hope this is just a fluke.  Edit (9/7/15): The Anker Staff has since gotten in touch with me and offered me a replacement. The replacement just arrived and works perfectly! There are no longer any problems fitting the USB plug into the charger. It's understandable that once in a while things get passed quality control, but Anker's excellent customer care fixed the problem quickly without much effort on my part."
0,"I bought this body fit for my iPad Air to protect it and in the same time to be able to see the apple logo, but after some months the protector became yellow and doesn't look anymore, I am not very happy about this"
1,Brought this for my daughter and she loves it. Haven't had any problems with it. Able to load over 40 games with no problem and still have over 1gb left. The issue so far is finding a good case.
0,"Easy install, and thin enough to fit with a case. I did the proper pre-installation cleaning procedures and it looked great, but there were smears on the glass almost immediately. I keep my hands fairly clean and never had problems with residue on screens, but this protector seems to be constantly smeared, and it's tough to remove."
-1,Very fragile.
1,I absolutely love this case. Very durable like an otterbox but without the plastic screen cover.
-1,Looked cool and I bought it cheap. After about a few weeks using the little kickstand it broke off. I won't get this model ever again.
-1,"As many others have posted, this does not seat correctly on the edges of a Nexus 6.  It looked terrible but I kept it on for 6 weeks because I didn't have the opportunity to order an alternative. I finally took it off when dirt was building up around the edges because it was lifted off the screen."
1,EXCELENTE
1,As was promised
1,It works really good!👍🏽
-1,Too much noise not good quality waste of money now need to buy different one
1,"Nice case it's great for the price I had a 30 dollar case from a phone store and it broke a few weeks later,I have had this case for a month an it still looks new and none of the stones came off yet"
1,Great color and offers great protection while looking good
1,Very high quality product! So easy to install and gives crystal clear view! I applied it while husband was driving so it's that easy with no bubbles to apply awesome packaging highly recommend
1,"***First off, I would like to preface this review by stating that I received it for free upon agreement that I would provide honest feedback on the item.<br /><br />The charger arrived one day after ordering...so once again, I was super impressed with Amazon's wonderful shipping. The charger itself is self-explanatory to use [plugged it into the cigarette lighter adapter] and it is a lot smaller than others I have come across which makes it convenient to use and/or store in the glove box (or middle seat compartment). It recognized and connected to my iphone as soon as I plugged it in and as far as I can tell, it works quickly. Since I haven't used it much I only gave it 4 stars, as I cannot say anything of the longevity of the charger or the charge it provides, but my initial impressions were very good [I plan on updating this over time :)]. The only minor thing that might be a nuisance is just that while the metal portion of the charger provides a sleek and sturdy look, hot weather makes this area really hot too and it's right where you would grasp it......but again, an almost inconsequential aside to a very well made product."
1,Awesome product!!!
1,THE BEST
-1,"I have an iPhone 5c and I specifically ordered it for my shape of phone and when it arrived, it was built for an iPhone 6. It sucked. The case was nice, though"
1,"If you're looking for rugged, dependable case for the Note 5, then this case is a perfect choice! I chose the case in the pink and black. It comes in two parts: the rubberized interior and a thick, plastic portion that snaps over to hold it in place. The case was easy to install and is a great fit for the phone. It also included a kickstand, which is handy if I'm watching movies or videos on my phone. This case feels like very solid protection.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discount by the seller in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
0,It's a good durable case but gets dirty really fast.
1,Love it
1,excellent and exactly what i expected.
-1,"I tried to use this to connect my iPhone 6 to a Bose sound dock with the old-style connector.  Not only did it not work, but when I tried to disconnect it the adapter broke into three separate pieces. I cut my hand and bled all over it. Then I had to remove it from the sound dock with pliers. I'm just glad it didn't break the bose or my phone.  Avoid this at all costs."
1,Was as described and works great!! Boyfriend loved it!
1,Love it! Many compliments on it.
1,it is easy to use and it's really compact size
1,"Very good protector, awesome dropped it and nothing man not even a scratch and it was dropped on gravel, although the no fingerprint feature isnt the best, its hard to get finger smudges off, but other than that best glass ever."
-1,Just not a great bluetooth headset. I found it hard to hear the players
-1,"I am very disappointed in this product.  Prior to installing this on my wife's Note 4, I installed one of their tempered glass protectors on my LG G4 and was quite pleased.  The one for my G4 covered my phone screen completely, with just a very small hazy bubble on the bottom section that is barely noticeable.  With this in mind, I thought that the one for my wife's Note 4 would have a similar fit and finish.  As you can see from the pictures, this was not the case at all.  First, it only covers the active screen portion, and leaves a 1-2 mm gap all the way around.  In addition to this, there is an air gap about the same 1-2 mm from the edge of the screen protector from where the glass just doesn't sit down all the way.  I'll be looking for other glass screen protectors in the future."
-1,"I have installed many screen protectors and this one was unlike others. The halo effect around the edges is a total shame. I'd like a replacement or something. This isn't just a consumer made issue, it's happening to almost everyone"
1,"I've been buying everything Fallout that I can find. This little thing is cool and looks kinda wasteland style too. It seems to work just fine and is well made. The sturdy little wooden box attached to the cord with the Fallout logo on has a nice classy look. Also the item arrived at my house in California, from Latvia, in 8 days. Not working days, 8 days total. Excellent."
-1,It's not a original samsung if it was it would fit perfectly but it does not.I didn't have problems with the conectors.I had problems putting the phone back together.the bezel frame didn't go back together the way it should and not only that the the framework that the Screen and digitizer is attached is different.I had to modify it in some areas to get the speaker to fasten down due to a little nub that is sticking up that was not on my original.That is not all the dam thing gets real hot too.I can't send my back because I modified mine to Fit.
1,"I liked and recommend to other customers b/c is nice-looking. I'd used for 1 month, it met my expectations."
1,Perfect...fast delivery! Just as described... And exactly what I needed!
1,"Love it!  Made for display and not for protection.  But, I knew that going in.  Was worried it would be the 'ND' instead of the Fighting Sioux logo, but it is exactly as pictured for the Galaxy Note 4.  Well definitely have it going during hockey season!"
1,"Shopping experience: excellent, products arrived quickly, at expected times.<br /><br />Product: Plantronics M60 is good, works fine, and is perfectly adequate for non-noisy environments.  Sound quality is not as good as 5 other corded ear sets I've tried in noisy environments (e.g., in my car).  For example, Jabra EarWave Corded is superior.  However, note that all corded ear sets I've tried (including Plantronics M60) give superior sound quality to any of the 5-6 Bluetooth (non-corded) ear sets I've tried."
1,Great product.. Honestly worked great in my side by side.
1,I bought this for a friens who wanted one to fit their ipod. So once i got i gave it tto the friend and it perfectly fit the ipod and was easy to put on. My friend was said it was easy to put on the arm and easy to adjust it too. This armband does fit an ipod perfectly well so that is good to know for those who have ipods and are looking for an armband to use with it when you are running and walking. Very well made and does seem like it will last for a while to come.
1,Bought this for work cell and love it...
1,"Worked as advertised on an AT&T iPhone 5 (16GB). Is a detailed repair, not for a novice. iFixit guide worked great and unit has been used for about two weeks with no issues."
1,Exactly as pictured.  Fits like a glove.
0,Gets too hot when charging & I Pad & I Phone at the same time & I asume that is what it is designed for
-1,terrible phone it came from china it's a copy from the galaxy I'm really  upset to buy this product
1,Good
1,Nice camera and easy to use
-1,DOES NOT WORK
1,"Beautiful  color, great value, and came before expected"
1,Does not have bumper put the fake glass over your screen and put this case on and your Iphone 6 will be classy a.f
1,"There are so many reasons to love this case.<br />1. It's really easy to put on<br />2. Has good protection, extra on the corners cause phones always seem to drop on the corners<br />3. Not bulky so it will still fit in your pocket or purse<br />4. Good grips on the edges so you are less likely to drop your phone<br />5. It's light weight, only adding 1.3 oz of weight to your phone<br />6. I have the black but it comes in really cool colors also<br />A five star item for sure. I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review."
1,Perfect size for carrying in your pocket.Couldn't be happier with this purchase.I got these on a protmotional offer so I could provide my honest feedback on these
1,Great
0,"Looks very sharp, but the plastic clips holding the phone in place are cheap and don't last very long.<br /><br />I've had 3 of the 4 plastic corners break and I've had the case for 2 months.<br /><br />I don't even carry my phone everywhere with me. It sits in my bag a lot.<br /><br />It's a sexy case and I don't regret buying it, it just didn't last long at all. :("
1,"I received this unit two days ago. Received it as scheduled. I went ahead and installed the unit. Installation was real quick, as everything is explained in the operation manual.<br />I did all tastes as required. Tuner was okay, playing music via cd was awesome, as well as playing music via USB.<br />I have a Sony xperia z2, so configuring my phone to this head unit via NFC was wonderful. I did make a series of phone calls, and everything went on smoothly.<br />Men, I was very happy. I love Sony."
1,Good
1,Awesome case!
1,"Took about 2 hours to install, but the effort was worth it.  I would had spent twice as much at the mall for a generic screen.  I got the original screen and fixed it at half the price."
1,Good condition. Good product
0,"For the price, it was alright and I loved the design on the back!  It also fit my phone well.  However, there were clips/flaws in the outer edges of the case that were disappointing. For example, there were areas where the purple/grey color was missing, the edges were rough, and there was a large blemish (rough area) on the front face plate of the case."
1,This is a perfect stand I use it to copy from my iPhone to computer  etc.
-1,"Piece of junk, picture quality sucks, when wiring just connect red power and video and audio, do not connect black gound"
1,"Great device, works as described. It is very compact, and has reduced the mess in my desk considerably! Definitely recommended!"
1,"Solid item, just as good as in the pictures online. Case has endured 2 falls no problems or scratches"
-1,"This is useless. It hold your GPS upside down and just isn't practical. I gave up trying to use it, and wish I had bought the clip version instead."
1,"I left my phone in my sweats and washed my iPhone 5 with this case on it. My iPhone went through all 4-cycles and after 2-years, it still works. I looked on Amazon to see if I could order this part of the case again. Now you have to buy the entire case."
1,"Protects very well.  I have repeatedly dropped my telephone with no problems whatsoever with cracks or scrapes.  The coloring is true to the picture.  The only reason it does not have a five star rating,  is because it is very difficult to clean."
1,Works like advertised.  Convenient with the cup holder thing.  It was a liitle small for the cup holders in a Chevy van but one of those foam can insulators made it fit like a charm.
1,"Great quality. Glad I didn't spend $150 for actual Apple product. And no, my wrist is not turning green, haters."
1,one of the best models samsung ever did
1,my granddaughter loves this case for her ipad
-1,Charges the phone but doesn't transfer music
1,"Charges everything so fast it's like magic.  Only one issue, the 12v connector needs a slightly longer connector at the very front.  It looses connection and really has to be jammed in.  I have a Toyota Camery, so it's not like some exotic strange car...  If that front connector stuck out about two more millimeters, it would be a 5-star, no questions..."
1,Thanks!
1,"I'm enjoying the simplicity of not having to plug my phone in to charge it. I wish the directions on hooking up induction device into my Samsung S4 would have been more detailed. I'm a technician and it stumped me for.a while, but, I was able to figure it out. I'm sure some person without my experience would not have been so fortunate.<br />I'm not complaining."
1,"This tracker works great for both my step count and sleep. I have a toddler who never sleeps through the night and it usually gets a record of when I'm up with him.  Sometimes it records my wakings as light sleep rather than awake, but I'm satisfied.  I accidentally sent it on a wash cycle and it survived in perfect working order.  Washing machine is about 200 steps!  Really impressed that this is working out just as well as the $100+ devices."
1,👌🏻👍🏻
1,"Fully charges my phone almost twice, and is small enough to not look bulgy in a pocket."
-1,Completely waste of money if you want a case to protect you phone. I dropped it two times and the case opened in both .Second time I wasn't lucky and the display crashed.
1,Good
1,It's good but I wish they sale  different parts separates
1,Excellent
1,Ok  phone I buy for someone
1,Just as ordered. Perfect!
1,fits good. just wanted something to soften drops just in case. fits the bill
1,love the case. It is perfect!
-1,Problems!!!
-1,"I wanted to like these, but literally half of the pens didn't work at all- like the pen tip wouldn't even come down"
1,"I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br />I was pretty sick of fighting for wall space plugging those power to usb adapters in to the wall and having cables all over the floor.<br />This is an very practical and effective solution's. It does exactly what it claims to do. Feels solid, not cheaply made.<br />2 USB ports in the back and a long AC adapter makes it easy to tuck behind my counter.<br />Makes so much easier to keep things organized. This is a great solution to fighting my clutter problem.<br />No Cons. Everything i needed and Does what it says it will."
0,It was just ok.
1,"Very clear, though sometimes disconnects from the phone for no apparent reason.  I think it is more comfortable than the competition."
1,"Color was nearly same as on my computer screen, but I am okay with it. And it's already saved my phone twice. May just need to get another one in a different color."
1,I have never been so impressed with a smartphone then the new moto G third generation it is light years ahead of the HTC One mini that it replaced. Great camera great battery life very fast and fluid no bloatware front carrier will never own another smartphone then a Motorola best smartphone for the money by far.
1,Awesome case only case we use for iPhone  otter box too bulky
1,I love this phone great screen and sound quality you can install all the apps you could possibly want with 32gb onboard storage i only wish you could update to lollipop i got this phone to replace my lg g3 that was stolen from me and i must say i am not disappointed.
1,The left side headset stop working replacement
1,"Great case, don't listen to the &#34;slippery&#34; reviews, the back is smooth but it has a rubber edge the whole way around it that is nice and grippy. Smooth clean and lightweight. A++"
-1,"Lens opening on case does not line up at all with the lens on my iPad. Case is cute, but I have to return it."
1,"Bought this for music in my car.  For the price, I couldn't be more satisified.  My phone connects automatically every time I get in the car and the audio sounds pretty good (for an aftermarket bluetooth adapter).<br /><br />4/5 because the phone feature on this is terrible - I had to stop making calls on it immediately because people complained they could not hear me.<br /><br />If you're buying it for music, I highly recommend."
1,"I tried the OEM quick circle case for the LG G4- way too slippery in my hand.  I kept feeling like I was going to drop it.  This one has a texture that makes it feel more secure in your hand and much easier to grab.  The case is shaped correctly for the phone and closed very securely every time yet opens easily.  It''s holding up well, looks great, fits perfectly, and at $15 is a much better value than the $50 OEM case for the G4.  I just wish they made it in more colors.  I'd buy another.  I only wish the quick circle cases had a plastic cover instead of an open window but that's the style and it works."
1,"My first smart phone, and I absolutely love it. Real Android (5.1.1 as of last update), great screen, good call quality (all cellphones aren't that good), excellent connectivity on WiFi and 4G. Works GREAT with Cricket Wireless. I get 4G LTE in strong signal areas, HSPA in my home which has a fair to poor signal. Calls always go through just fine, even in my low signal home.<br /><br />I selected Cricket Wireless as my carrier, and bought the BYOP kit from Amazon. Works great, but read the caution below. Solution is to make sure you buy a MicroSIM kit for BYOP.<br /><br />The only caution is that the box has an icon showing Micro SIM OK, nanoSIM Bad!. Googling this, I found that the electrical contacts for the SIM slot can catch on NonoSIM to MicroSIM adapters if the SIM card is removed. This is the case for me, since I chose Cricket Wireless (ATT Prepaid) as my carrier. Since I don't intend to remove the SIM, it isn't a big problem. Knowing about the problem, should I need to remove the SIM (to change carriers, for example), I will need to take care extracting the Cricket NanoSIM. You can google the method, which is not complicated, and is essentially slipping a very thin piece of plastic (like screen protector plastic) into the SIM slot before gently removing the NanoSIM"
-1,"This case cracked on the side of the camera after only a few weeks of use. My wife never removed it from her phone, and doesn't know how it happened. The only thing I can think is it happened from putting it in her pocket."
1,Nice
1,"I picked this phone for my teen who likes Google. His school uses it so he is familiar with their apps. We have other phones in the house, iPhone & fire phone. The phone comes with screen saver and a gel like case, without the case the phone feels like fabric on the back. The case is very thin and bendable. The headphones are ok. The screen is bright and easy to read from. The icons are very vivid, kid like and colored like jolly ranchers. My initial reaction was lukewarm,  I am a fan of other brands. But once I spent some time with it and got use to its different menu system and apps it actually is pretty nice for its price range. Camera works well and has a quick shutter. Power button is on the side next to volume, sometimes turn it off by accident. I do like the large screen. The teen likes it, and it's cheap enough to replace if lost or damaged.<br />Update: the FM radio feature allows you to record what your hearing and has a speaker function, although not room filling sound allows you to use the radio feature without your headphones on your ears. The headphones are the antenna. Battery seems to drain quickly, depending on how much you use and have screen on, this may become an issue."
1,"Exact fit , especially like the built - in screen protector. Only one I found that had a protected charging port , keeps the  dirt out .."
1,"Great product, did the job."
-1,Looks like paper glued to a phone case and was off center wasn't me favorite
-1,"The magnet on this case is so weak that when I dropped the phone, the case whipped open on the way down and the phone landed on the sidewalk glass-down and smashed.  Plus it was never that great to start with, it looked worn after just a few uses.  Please do not buy this case if you are relying on it to protect your phone."
-1,This cover fits nicely but it also retains heat. Even with no activity my phone was always hot.
1,"Works GREAT!  I bought this so I could send music from my DVD collection to our fire pit/grill area which is outside the normal bluetooth range.<br /><br />This unit is EXACTLY what I needed and it works like a charm.  Now when we build a fire and are making s'mores, we can enjoy our large CD collection and not have to rip them to our phones.  We use it with the DKnight Magicbox II Bluetooth 4.0 Ultra Portable Wireless speaker and it is a wonderful combination."
1,"Fixed my daughter's phone (for the 2nd time) using the Sellicase kit.  Worked like a champ, but would definitely use one of the YouTube videos.  There are a couple that have a template with them for the various parts (especially the small screws).  Makes the job much easier.  Phone's working like new now!  Would buy again...if needed."
-1,it does not last long at all one day maybe my old battery lasted longer
0,Stones already missing
1,great buy super fast shipping a+++
1,better than expected
1,"Love this case, works great!"
1,"I never do reviews  &#34; never &#34; but I just dropped my phone in Starbucks parking lot came out and noticed my phone on ground , tire marks on case!!! I am using my phone to write review !!! Don't no how it made it honestly but it did"
-1,I'm going to return it . It has problems
0,Not as good as Motorola Buds. These cut in and out and sound quality is not that great.
1,great buy super fast shipping a+++
1,These cables work well but I find that sometimes I have to flip the connector over and plug it back into the iPad or it will tell me that it is not charging and sometimes they can be a bit finicky and you need to keep plugging them in for it to say it is &#34;charging&#34;.  But heh for the price I can live with it.
1,It works as expected.
1,It looks just like it I got the one with the blue glitter and pink hearts I accidntly drop my phone and it didn't brake it's actually protective or maybe I was just lucky but my phone is intact and so is the case
-1,"Do not charge my phone,"
1,"I purchased the same case for full price and it started breaking soon after, this is the same case and the price was spectacular"
1,Got to me fast. It is an OK quality but serves its purpose.
1,"Perfect screen protector! Same, if not better quality than the ones you pay $50 for in cell phone stores."
0,Pretty sturdy but not too comfortable to type with it on
-1,"Update 05/06/17: Piece of junk. Skips recording. Almost every time I need video of an incident it is missing. It will have video before or video after, but not what I need. DO NOT waste your money on this camera.<br />Update 10/27/15: Have started having problems with KDLINKS X1. The camera reboots continuously for about three minutes every time I cut my vehicle off. I have been in touch with the seller and was told it is probably a battery issue. They asked me to charge the unit with a phone charger for several hours, which I am currently doing, and see if that fixes the problem.<br /><br />After doing my research on dash cams I purchased the KDLinks X1 Full- HD camera along with a (Panorama S 2015 edition updated Sony Exmor IMX322 Sensor CMOS DashCam PowerUCC Panorama 2S / S International Model) and installed both in my truck side by side. Both cameras had the best reviews for the cost on several forums. Both cameras have performed well. Even though both manufactures recommend taking the camera out of the vehicle on hot days, I have not. I have left both on my windshield all summer in a black truck with the windows up and plenty of 100 degree plus days without a problem. The picture quality on both cameras is excellent both day and night. The KDLinks ships with a GPS module and software that will display your speed and location on google maps when played back and it was $20 cheaper than the Panorama. The KDLinks cord was also much longer. The Panorama S can handle larger storage cards. The reason for four stars instead of five is the mount. The suction cup is built well and holds good but the swivel/disconnect that goes between the camera and suction cup is very weak. So flimsy that they include an extra one with the adhesive mount. If they fix this they will have a perfect setup. The mount on the Panorama is rock solid but it cost $20 more and does not come standard with GPS."
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
1,Good protection for my tablet. Fairly easy to apply.
1,"Have used this product for about two months now as my daily charger at work. Quality has been good, no experiences of not charging or being warned by iOS that the device is unsupported. Would (and probably will) buy this product again."
-1,"Horrible headphones.  No matter which size ear piece I use, they constantly fall out of my ears when exercising.  There is an audible &#34;clicking&#34; noise from one of the earbuds when I run, like one of the mechanisms is loose in there, and it is difficult to establish the bluetooth connection.  I also find that having the control buttons on the ear piece is a total pain in the a$$, as you have to constantly touch your ear to make song and volume selections.  Makes me feel like I'm practicing for the Secret Service.  Hate these headphones and I am going to send them back ASAP.  I guess all the great reviews came from people who got these sent to them for free, like a lot of electronics vendors do on Amazon.  Cheap."
1,I use this to charge two of my 6 plus and one of my gopro at the same time. very nice and compact.
1,nice cable
1,Worth the money for a great privacy
1,"These speakers are tremendous sounding in my Chevy sonic. Built an enclosure just slightly bigger than what they spec out at and... Wow. They hit harder than the 12&#34; subs that I had before. The amp is good. Probably a bit to powerful for these subs but it can be turned down. This amp gets hot! It needs to be in a well ventated area and probably should have some sort of fan on it. Otherwise, awesome"
1,Fits the Samsung 4S edge perfectly.  Hold the phone really tight.  My daughter doesn't like to carry a bag and this cover has enough space for her cards and cash.  The colors are very classy.
1,"I bought this case for my husband's phone because he needs to carry his phone to work in a safe place, and this case does a very good job, it has a little stand in case you want to put the phone in the table and watch videos, the case is very resistant and He already dropped his phone several times and the phone is intact as the case too! Nice product!!!"
-1,"Waste of time and money, if it does do what the description says you need plenty if patience to figure it out and I believe this item had a previous owner because there was a picture in the album of what look like the inside of a prison!  I have returned this item which is a better success then the overall item!"
1,nice
1,"Perfect fit.  Easy to install, but be sure to use plenty of the spray when you install it. GPS is mounted on bicycle and has seen thousands of miles in all kinds of weather and screen protector still looks new."
0,Works great with cleaning but leaves a nobody micro lint particles behind.
-1,No seriously waste of money don't buy this! phone i got this phone it sucks! its slow and the camera is blury and wow! the keyboard is off! dont buy this okay just dont buy this its enough android s***ty! phone
1,I love my new case. It is exactly as advertised and expected. thank you
1,"[[VIDEOID:62e5762bb8e193596a116b24f7622a79]] We are always skeptical when we review these types of headphones, but we were impressed with this set for the comfort and sound quality.  as we show in the video, the packaging comes with the headphones, a micro USB cable to charge them and a few sized ear pieces.  Definitely try the different sizes and find the best one for you.  This will make a different in comfort, staying in the ear, sound quality and background noise blocking.<br /><br />The diagram left a little to be desired on locating the charging port and we had a good laugh finding it.  I show in the video exactly where it is and how to get to it.  We knew it was there but did not feel the little catch at first.  Charging did not take long and we get hours of streaming play from it.  Using it for calls decreased the battery life some.<br /><br />The audible and tiny LED light let you know the status of the headphones at any time.  It tells you when it powers on and off to make things easier.  Pairing was quite simple as well.<br /><br />So the bad thing.  The microphone is located in the tiny control bar and we tend tower that part behind our ears so while we could hear them well the other side didn't always get a crystal clear sound from us. There was some background noise.  It tried to pick only my voice up but there was some definite background and the location makes that tough for the headphones to do.  See the video for what we mean and a demo.<br /><br />Comfort for long periods of time was not a problem and we enjoyed the sound quality.  These are not supposed to be music perfection in sound, but the snug fit while we ran was just as important as having decent sound quality.  There headphones did both.<br /><br />See the video for unpacking, setup and more."
-1,I hate it because it didn't come with a plug in cord.  So  now I have to buy a separate cord.  I should NOT  have bought this item because of that.
1,Great
1,Very Happy With This Product
-1,It doesn't work for my phone...and that sucks a waste of money and waiting on it to come in the mail..
1,"These were a huge hit! I got these for the kids on vacation. The bags are well made of quality materials, and the kids were able to film themselves underwater. This added a whole new dimension to vacation pictures! Pictures and videos underwater were clear as a bell. More important, we didn't have to worry about wetting or scratching the phones during our outdoor activities, and there was no arguing about where and when they could bring their phones.."
1,He loves it!
1,"I absolutely love this thing. It holds about 6 full charges for my phone at a time, so I charge it completely about once every two weeks. It's exactly what I needed, and saves me from having a dead phone."
1,Works super good underwater!
1,Great product. Didn't not have any issues with it in Florida. Fast shipping.
1,Great product. Just as described and delivered in the time offered
-1,Do not buy this piece of garbage.  The item does not look anything like what you get. I am returning this item ASAP.  Don't bother with this product
1,I should of did this a long time ago. The audio quality is really good if your iffy. The only thing is when you turn your car off and on you gotta turn the adapter back on and when it turns on and connects it's a bit choppy for a few secs but after that it's crystal clear.
1,Great looks good and work good Thanks
1,"works fine, no problem thanks."
1,"Good value - and I like that they have the nerve to mark the Lightning end with their own emblem.  That way I know when/if a cable fails, if it's one of Csync's.  We have 4 iPhone 5 phones of various versions in the family, so we have many, many of these cables.  They fail often and I've never known from whence they came.  Now I'll know if it's one of these.  So far so very good: no &#34;this is a non-genuine part you are using&#34; message on the phones when these are plugged in.  They work very well."
1,works as advertised.
-1,The glass chipped off at the side. Didnt even drop it and only place in my bag all the time. Not sure it is really tempered glass as claimed. Will like a refund if possible.
1,"I love, love, love my Samsung Gear Fit!  It is the coolest thing ever!  Now, I’m no workout guru or some extreme techie, but for this being my first techie watch that connects to my cell phone, this is the Coolest!!!  It is extremely user friendly and easy to learn.  It is sharp looking and a lot of fun.  It fits nice on the wrist too!<br /><br />But first, let me say that I bought the Samsung Gear Fit for the purpose of tracking my sleep, which to be honest, only tracks movement, so it is limited, but it gives you the general idea of your sleep pattern, which when viewed on your phone shows your peak times of movement.  Very Cool!<br /><br />The other cool thing is that it will let you know when you get an email, text, call or voicemail.  You can see who the communication is from and can read the messages, plus you can respond with short prerecorded messages.  The standard replies are on your phone or you can create your own.  And, if you get a call on your cell phone, you can reject it without having to dig your phone out of your purse or pocket.  Very Cool!  These weren't the reasons why I got my Gear Fit, but since I work where cell phones are only permitted in the break room, I now know when I get an important message that I have to respond to.  Also, the Bluetooth goes far.  I charge my phone overnight in the kitchen on the first floor, but still get updates on my Gear Fit in my bedroom on the second floor.<br /><br />And, much too my surprise, after a few days I thought, the only thing missing on this thing was the weather.  Well, after having more time to play with it, there are different clock options, one showing a current weather icon (sun, cloud, moon, etc.) with the temperature, which is updated when your phone is updated.  WooHoo, that made my day!<br /><br />I haven’t used the workout options, yet.  Nor, have I used the media controller, but it also seems very cool.  The heart rate monitor has only been a beat off from the monitor that you use onyour finger.  And, the phone finder is a nice added bonus.<br /><br />Now, I read some of the reviews and I see folks complaining about the chrome peeling off.  I've had my watch for exactly a month and have worn it constantly.  The chrome has not peeled; however, I don't wear the watch in the shower and I push it up my wrist when I'm in water, such as when washing dishes.  So, I think a little discretion has to be used to keep it looking good as new.  I do have to say that it sits a little high and I have bumped it on a wall, but no scratches or broken glass.  In fact, the only scratches are on the Samsung silver logo on the bottom of the Gear Fit band from having my wrist on my desk.<br /><br />Now, there are a couple minor things that would be a nice change:<br /><br />1)  It’s a bit of a pain to confirm that your deleting a message from your Gear Fit each time you do; i.e., you hit the trash can to delete a message, then you have to hit the check-mark to confirm that it will be deleted.  I think that if you accidentally delete a message, it’s no big deal since the message stays on your phone.  If anything, it should give you the option in the settings to choose if you want to confirm that you’re deleting a message or maybe give it the five-second rule, like it’s done on my Samsung Mini, to cancel the deletion.<br /><br />2)  I love the countdown timer, but I wish you could set more than one time at a time.  For instance, I get a 5-minute break, 15-minute break and a 30-minute lunch.  It would be really cool to be able to save more than one setting at a time.  Say, that you could preset three and then choose the one you want when you need it, or give preset options such as 5, 15, 30, etc., but with the ability to change it by a minute with the +/- key to suit specific needs.  For instance, I get a 15 minute break, but I would want the alarm to go off at 13 so I have time to get back to my station; the option would be something like, preset to 15, hit minus key twice to get to 13.  Or, maybe have the ability to set timer options on your phone with the ability to choose the one you want to use like you can when choosing a reply.  Now, I realize this isn't for fitness, but you have to admit, through the course of the day, I have to change the timer to 15, then to 30, then to 15 and last to 5.  Hitting the +/- key 30 times is, well, a hassle. Plus, should I be doing sprints during my workout, I don't want to have to change the timer each time to switch back and forth.<br /><br />3) And last, the only other thing missing is an alarm on the clock!  It would be nice to set an alarm (and, while you’re at it, maybe a snooze).  Given how watches are programmed these days, I think this would be a really easy fix.  After all, it is a watch.<br /><br />So, guys & gals at Samsung, maybe these tiny adjustments can be made in the next upgrade.  Now, wouldn’t that be Really Coooool!!!"
1,Had my case for a few weeks now... so far soooo good. Only bad thing is the flip part gets in the way of the camera. But I would still recommend this product.
1,"I was debating either this case or the spegin case and I went with this one due to more variety of colors. Side buttons work great. It does increase the size of the phone, but what case doesnt. I love it!"
1,"Still in great shape, two years later"
1,Works as advertised.
1,I like it use it all the time.
1,Great parts. Thanks.
1,Absolutely amazing! i love this product went to Universal and Disney and was able to charge my Iphone 5 both times completely charged with out me charging the device it's self. The product was charged when i recived so it was good to go! Would most definitely recommend to all my friends really great and perfect size to carry in your purse!
1,"Perfect fit.  Quality seems good.  Carabiner is probably more useful, for me, than the belt loop.  I prefer the belt clips.  But overall a good product for the money."
-1,This product is FAKE! Do not purchase!
0,I just opened it & from first glance it's alright. Not the best quality case but for the price it is exactly what I expected. Crossing my fingers that it will last as while. It does have a strong odor. Hoping that goes away after a while of use.
1,Just what I wanted and it arrived quickly.
1,Just don't like wearing the heart monitor shout be like the Fitbit HR
-1,"Echoes, charger flap first stay shut"
1,"For a fair review, I received a discount on my order and I'm happy to say this case is fantastic. Protects my phone and doesn't make it bulky at all. Very happy customer!"
1,I bought this to use with my iPhone 6 plus in my brand new Honda Accord coupe v6. Well it worked. I like the way it holds  my phone. I will get another one for my wife's car. Very sturdy.
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
1,"[[VIDEOID:e15d0a2de938a390e1af79e9fd82c9ad]]I am absolutely in love with this Collen Samsung Galaxy s6 case.  The pictures really don't do this case justice.  This case is made of poly carbonate and plastic and is fused together to make it shock absorbent.  The aluminum sheeting on the back really stands out though, it really has a polished metal look and is very unique.  It was incredibly easy to install yet at the same time you can tell it will keep my Samsung phone safe my breaking.  It also comes with a tempered glass screen.  I will be purchasing all my phone cases from Collen from now on.  The quality is top notch and the price is even better!  I did receive this product as a promotion so that I may provide my honest unbiased review."
-1,"Did not work well, kept forgetting to request return now stuck with it, do not buy this"
1,Great product!
-1,I'm very very disappointed. The rope in a sticker don't even think about buying this false advertisement.
1,"This feels really good in my ears. it does not hurt, it does not fall of, it's just the perfect size. Would be glad to recommend and I have to say that this seller made this comfort possible for me just by giving this headset to me for free, just so I could honestly review it later"
1,Love the colors! However it has chipped pretty quickly.
1,Completely satisfied so far. I tested one of the cases in my sink by putting a tissue in it and completely submerging the case in the sink. It worked great. My galaxy s5 fits inside the case very nicely. My brother was able to squeeze his galaxy note 4 inside one of the cases as well.
1,excelente
1,Very durable. Strong case!
0,"I love the LOOK of the case and fits very well. Unfortunately, just as I thought, it has been a month and rhinestones are falling out. The middle is made of the tacky glue with stones on it (very good) but the edge is a strip of rhinestone which the strip is falling off and rhinestones have fallen out. Was pretty for a month, but just ordered a better case."
1,softer plastic and still holds phone
1,"I got this to back up power for the i-phone.I am normally around a power source, but if I decide to tear out on the bike,drop it in my pocket and go! I have only had to charge my phone three time/per one battery charge,but am sure I could go more. The led light is a bonus feature that helps also.Really bright.With charge level indicator, this is all you need for back up power for most devices."
-1,They didn't even last a month and the wire braid around the iPhone plug broke down and then they stopped working. That happened on two tog the three cables j purchased. So it's been about a month and now I only have one working cable left.
1,works great on Windows 10.
1,Only thing when you remove it from car to another car the sticky part doesn't work
1,adorable
-1,"I do not like this item. The elephant is discolored, and this case does not protect my phone at all. Why is this one plastic and the case for the 4s is rubber? I liked this case for the 4s a lot more, and I don't know why they changed it."
-1,"Cheap plastic, not very sturdy. Pin came out of clip after first week of use and fell off of belt. Don't waste your time or money buying this holder"
-1,Good case but for phone calls people couldn't hear me through the case nor could I hear them.
-1,"It was a vastly different color of gold than what was pictured- more of a dark yellow, almost like if you mixed copper and gold. It arrived after a very long wait, and when I recieved it the case was already broken to the extent that it would not even stay on the phone. Save the dollar you'd waste on this and just get a cheap case at WalMart- at least then you can actually use what you bought."
1,Really Nice
-1,What can I say besides misleading it appears to be 2 pieces and it says often bought with the USB chargers that are also 2 pieces!  I should have read the reviews which I normally do but I didn't think I would get 1 CHARGER port!  I'm sure they knew they were being deceiving ! As for as as the quality I don't know I'm just pissed I only received one piece!
1,"This is exactly what I ordered, and it is nice, but I don't know how secure my cell phone will be if I accidentally drop it."
-1,Really not impressed. Two did not work right out of the package. One stopped working in one day. The last one took a whole week before it didn't work. I didn't pay much for them and still didn't get my money's worth out of them.
1,I like it. not perfect but good!
0,"all good. but it needs our command to check us, not automatic. and there is no function to measure heart rate periodically or continuously. its the very disappointing. we cant extract raw value of GSR, only 'connected' or 'disconnected'. also no multi-pairing, poor app market (android). if you focus on heart rate only, mio alpha will be best choice."
1,great buy super fast shipping a+++
1,"Great film, it makes my phone look even better after applying"
1,Great.
1,Works. What else can you say?
-1,"I requested a red and black case, I  received an orange and black case instead.Not happy. The case itself is fine.it would have received a better rating,"
1,ok
-1,Doesn't stick to phone screen
-1,"used the Plantronics BackBeat Headphones for three months before the right ear bud stopped delivering sound.  amazon has a one-month return policy, so I'm stuck with half a headset.  nice color, however."
1,Fit well and battery lasts for a while!
1,I totally recommend this.
0,"Bought this for a road trip where we knew the radio reception would be spotty. After reading the instructions, it seemed simple to get started but pairing it with the phone was hit/miss. Once we got it paired (luck of the draw) it worked great. But we were afraid of turning it off because we may not figure out how to keep it paired again."
-1,Not waterproof.
1,it is very good and i like it.
1,Been using for a long time super great product 😏👌🏾
1,"Works great, love it!!"
1,Fast shipping. Easy install. Works perfectly fine.
1,"This clear case is great. I love that I can take a picture of my kids, cut it down & use it this case. I can use decorative papers as well. If you're a crafter, this case is a must. Never have the same case as anyone else, ever again. Silicone is flexible & durable.<br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion, but does not constrict me to give a positive rating."
-1,
1,I love being able to have a spare battery on hard.  Lighter than carrying around a portable charger and cable.
1,I love the protection this case gives. I've dropped my phone several times while using this case and it has protected it from any damage. It goes on easy and I love the way it feels in my hand. It does add a little bulk to the phone but I actually like that it feels bigger. I've gotten many compliments on how great it looks. I would definitely recommend this case.
1,I bought these during the Prime Sale and like them. The colors & texture of these cords help make them easy to find.
-1,"Says its compatible with finger print scanner but it's isn't. Does not work, not pleased with this product."
-1,Don't like it not what I expected
1,Easy to install and works really well
1,"Nice, but only two of the three worked.  But, the two that did work have worked flawlessly."
0,"I give it only a 3 star because it didn't fit well into the lighter. But, for my daughter's car out fit awesome; in which, in her case it's a 6 star. The product is well made. Great invention. I just wished the insertion portion was longer."
1,I bought this a couple weeks ago and so far so good. Came on time and works like a charm. And much cheaper than other cables. Double win. I'd give it five stars but I haven't had them long enough to say if they last
1,"I bought this as a replacement to an Incipio Case that didn't work out.  This case, on the other hand, has been fantastic.  It's hard, but not huge.  I love it, would recommend, and will buy again for a future iPhone."
1,Very cute and I've used it for a long time. It protects the screen and is easy to open and close and I like that I can throw an ID & debit card in it when I don't want to carry my purse.
1,Awesome product!!!!
1,"I really like these they are very comfortable to wear and have had absolutely no issues with them for the since I received them, Pairing them to my phone took seconds and  the controls were a bit awkward at first, but I think that was only because a similar pair I have are a bit different. The sound quality is not outstanding, but it is pretty good in my opinion.<br /><br />The charge on these lasted pretty long . I used them off and one for about three days before I needed to charge them. The range I noticed is about 20 feet, unless you are trying to catch signal between a door or walls It dropped on me when going to my third floor while the phone was on second floor. All in al they are not bad for the price."
1,Works great.
1,Great product. Fit as expected. Better than some of the more expensive so called tactical pants as far as practicality.
1,Is a excellent cover and super easy to install
1,Love this case. I kept breaking my commander plastic clip so after the 4th clip I got this one. So glad I found it. I love how it keeps it nice and secure and has a magnet clip keeps it shut. The material is nice and thick. I have had a stray string come loose but nothing major.
0,"Pros: Has a flashlight. Nice display. Good camera.<br />Cons: Slow, no memory, has a tendency to crash (all the time). Strange version of ANdroid. Packed with proprietary bloatware.<br /><br />Overall not the ultimate smartphone experience. Spend another $30-$50 and get a phone that will actually perform. Not this wannabe smartphone."
1,Battery arrived in good shape
1,This case works great
1,I received the Avantek universal cell phone car mount from Avantek in order to write this review. I had not seen a reason to buy one of these but I was willing to give it a try. I was surprised to find out that this cell phone car mount is very handy. It leaves my hands free to drive yet It puts my phone right where I can see it. So it makes using my GPS maps function so much easier. I wish I had tried one before. Some assembly was required. I basically had to pop the mounting clip into the back of the mount. It was easy to do and I had no trouble figuring it out. There is a retaining ring to keep it in place. It clips on my air vent easily and adjust to just about any angle that I need. The wings on each side of the mount expand with the push of a little button on the back. You simply sit your phone in it and then gently click the wings snugly against your phone. So far it has held my phone securely. We live on a gravel road and I have never had it fall or jar loose. I am very pleased with the Avantek Universal Car Mount. I would recommend it if you are looking for a great affordable way to keep your phone where you can see it.
1,"This is a great charger to use in your car, and I really like that is has 2 ports, so both my husband and I can charger our phones at the same time.  I also like that it has an air purifier on it as well.  I can't really say how well that works as I don't have any way to test the actual ability to provide clean air, thought I am hoping it helps with my asthma and allergies.  Either way, it's ability to charge 2 items at the same time is great.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
1,Good to have website to show you how to put on
1,"I love this product. It is so much better than the &#34;film,&#34; products."
1,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this. I tried a different, $12, vent gripper model that claimed it was big enough for Nexus 6, but it broke in the first 7 minutes of use with my nexus in its case (not a very thick case, but that may have been the critical factor). I was worried this one wouldn't stick to my curved dash (haven't tried it on a textured area yet) but it holds TIGHT! Took it on a road trip and it did a great job. I live in a high heat area (100 F is normal right now) and it has had NO slippage/falling off of the dash. Great product for a great price. Def a go-to item for any Nexus 6 owners."
1,Works well
1,Lost my iPhone to water. 2 days after getting this phone it was filming my daughter in the pool underwater. Operating systems are so similar I barely noticed the difference. Many compliments on how sharp and clear the pictures are. Overall  satisfaction with this phone is 5 stars..
1,We purchased several of this cases for our business and have been completely happy with them. We had one glass screen protector break when I was installing it and they sent out a replacement free of charge.
1,Very good product and easy to install.
-1,"Not the happiest with this item. If you have your phone in it and not in a plastic bag dirt, dust, lint, and anything else that might be in your pocket or anywhere for that matter gets inside and ruins your screen. I will say if it was improved on it could be a great product ! $20 bucks you def get what you paid for"
1,"Very happy with this unit. Long battery life, three size ear pieces, TWO ear hooks. Decent quality audio."
1,Good cord no problems out it it
1,"This is stylish and this is sleek.  Importantly, it's truly heavy duty.  Yes, it's bulky, and that's fine with me.  Otterbox has rightly become a leader in protective cases.  If you value your Samsung Galaxy S6, Getting this rightly called &#34;defender&#34; is a step in the right direction.  Very highly recommended."
1,great!
-1,Couldn't get it to charge. Need refund info
1,Very good.  It strongly attacks to the surface you nedd and offers a perfect grip for your gps or any other device.
1,good
1,Work perfectly
1,"I've had the Quick 2.0 charger for about a week now and have been very pleased with it.  I've charged my iPad Air, my HTC One(M8), my wife's iPhone 6+, an LG G Pad, and a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.  They all charged very quickly without any issues.  The micro USB cable that comes with it may be a little short for some people, but it was perfect for me.  I had to supply my own lightning cable for the Apple products."
-1,Not real apple ear pods. Volume did not work on mine.
0,"No major complaints. OK for the money, just a little spongy but works well enough."
1,"[[VIDEOID:8943003c9d2daf0b517bd419f9f13144]]This is a fantastic multi cable , this is a must for everyone .This is the ultimate charging cable , for multiple devices .<br />This offers you a:<br />- micro USB<br />- Lightning compatible<br />- Apple 30 pin<br />- 8 Pin compatible<br />- kindle<br />This works amazing with all our different devices , it doesn't give any error messages .The ends fit nice and tight for a secure charge .<br />I love this because I don't have to have a bunch of cables , you can have everything neat and tidy with just this one awesome cable .<br />This is so versatile and useful , saving money on lost cables and time looking for cables .<br />I love everything about this amazing cable and I can guarantee you will love it as much as I do.<br /><br />I highly recommend this awesome multi cable ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
-1,Phone fit; magnetized strap leaves a lot 2 B desired!!!!!
1,A+++!!! Epic seller!!!
1,It took almost 2 months but I got it tested it out before installing the phone and no leaks perfect also the kick stand is very flimsy but it's awesome
1,I wear this every day and it has helped me get up and move. I find myself checking the band during the day for  how far I have walked and if I need to walk more to get to the distance I need then I get up from the computer or tv or sewing machine and walk. I have gotten better exercise since I received my band than I had in the last year so I am loving it.
1,"This case is awesome! Very easy to put on the phone, and I feel that it is much better then the last case! Love it!"
1,excelent<br />20mts dive no problem
-1,"This started off as a promising product. Worked well once I set it up. However, once it gets a little warm sitting in the sun, it no longer works at all. The screen either flickers or doesn't turn on at all. Would not purchase again."
1,little bit of a a pain to get the cord in but so cute love it.
1,Best screen protector I've ever had. It has a slightly Matte finish  and the directions make it go on so easily. The cutouts are perfect in it doesn't leave smudges like other protectors leave. you won't go wrong with this protector
1,We use this on our end table daily. Works great.
1,very high quality. bought two and third is on its way! Absolutely recommended!
1,Great product. Fits perfectly. Easy to install. Reasonably priced. Looks very good.
-1,Wrong case size. Not for iPhone 5s.
1,was ok
-1,This product is horrible. Reception is noisey
1,"Nice case, love the color."
1,Love it!
1,Great
1,"Absolutely exactly what I wanted!! Couldn't see anything wrong with the phone. It does not come with Apple charger, but it still works and charges the phone. Couldn't be happier with my purchase."
1,Really Nice
1,Holds ups to fall and throws from a toddler. But I do need to replace about every 2-3 month because the screen gets to where you can't see out of it.
1,Very nice. My kids love it!
-1,It's as if I don't have a privacy screen at all. People can still see what I'm doing on my phone. Not very happy with it
1,Thanks :-)
-1,The magnets are not strong enough to hold my iphone 5 even when the car is not moving. The adhesive wont stick to any surface. Don't even bother getting this!
1,"Perfect fit! After ordering the generic model only to find the camera hole in the wrong location,I ordered this one for my LTE tablet,and it's perfect. Nice quality, and the bonus pen is great too."
1,not too shabby. plus its lifetime warranty.
1,It lasted quite a few drops... finally the case died :( all the fastners broke off.  does get dirty.
1,Fits Perfectly! Looks great! Feels good!Will order other colors for sure!
1,Their colors are really nice and they fit the iPhone.<br />I have been using them for a year now and they still look great.<br />I recommend them to anybody :)
1,Thanks as described
0,"First of all I saw a lot of stars given to this product so I decided to buy 3 of it 2 black and one transparent This were great at the beginning specially with the black one as its really cover the device very will and protect it. The gripping is very great as well. After two weeks from using the first pice I start noticing that the right side has become a bit loser and then a week after that right side start to come out same as the pictures are shown. I though I miss used it at the beginning but then the rest of the other sides start to come out. I decided to use the second one but again same problem all the sides start to come out. It seems that the glow which been implemented is not that strong. Now I am using the transparent one, It has some advantages and disadvantages compare to the black. Advantage is that it's thinner Disadvantage I doubt that it can resist drops same as the black Also it has the same struckter as the black. I wish I can get a feedback from the I-blason I like their products but it doesn't make any sense to be to buy multiple item from the same product"
-1,"It's a good cover but, the problem it's effect the phone's battery after while"
-1,Screen didn't work.
1,"I needed a screen protector that was worth the money. Better yet, one that I didn't have to give a disclaimer about when handing someone my phone to watch a video. Thanks LABC!!! With the discount I got, I'm on cloud 9!!!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00PJCQA58 iPhone 6 screen protector, LABC iPhone 6 Tempered Glass, iPhone 6 HD Tempered Diamond Glass Technology NEWEST 0.2mm thinner thickness Protection Screen Protector by LABC - 4.7&#34; Inch Screen - Premium Ballistic Nano Anti Scratch / Scratch Free Ultra Slim Tech Armor for Apple iPhone 6 4.7&#34; - iPhone 6 screen protector (LABC-305)]]"
1,Very good.
0,Just working to get used to it
1,
1,"Great Case, I've dropped my phone more times then I can count and this case saves it every time, Very Sturdy and strong case, holds fine except if you start running be aware whenever you do a little run to your car while it's raining etc cause it might slip out of place"
-1,"I've  owned Otterbox Defenders for all my family's phones but that have an Achilles heal in the fact the rubber material they use for the outer sleeve stretches after about 5 months of use and need's to be replaced. That in itself is unacceptable but now reduced their warranty because this problem was getting g to expensive  for them. My first one for my Note 4 us about 5 months old and I just had to file a warranty claim for a new outer slip cover. Experience has taught me I will be doing so in about another 5 months and after that (pardon me there is no easier way to put this) I'm screwed. Google the problem and you find thousands of owners all with the same stretching problem and apparently Otterbox doesn't care and this case carry a $69.00 MSRP that's  not chicken feed. Guess I'll  have to look at a Life Proof. More expensive for sure but wit the Otterbox Defender outer rubber slipcover only lasting 5 months before the corners stretch you'd only be entitled to two replacements before the warrant expires which translates into buying a new case from Otterbox every year, I don't think so."
1,"I love it!!! You can answer calls, sync to all apps, monitor sleep activity and physical activity....it's awesome!"
1,Love this case - one of my favorites
1,Great quality Ipad Air 2 connector cord for use with the Phantom 3. Perfect length.
1,Easy installation... Good fit.... Super quality...
1,"Price ='s quality!  NOT saying it's cheaply made.  It's of equal value and super fun, cute and easy to install on my phone."
1,Great!
1,"I was happy with the up but I truly love the up24 because it tracks my sleep, water and steps. It even allows me to sync with myfitness pal and other apps."
1,"Nifty little wallet phone case! Just what I needed. This is my 4th year in college and each year I have to transition from purses to a backpack. This results in a lot of shuffling of my stuff, especially my wallet. I've found myself without my wallet on campus way too many times. It is not the best feeling...especially when you're on an empty stomach and stuck there for hours! It's super cute and fits my phone snugly. I've jammed quite a bit of credit and debit cards plus my ids...and it still manages to close. Yay! I was also pleasantly surprised with a screen protector. It applies on very neatly and does not take away from the beautiful retina screen. Would definitely buy again."
-1,"Have had Tone Infinim bluetooth for less than 2 months and on/off switch already does not work. Had a short in it, now does not work at all. Hope the 1 year gaurantee is worth something, because its not to Amazon."
-1,Poorly made...cheap
1,This is an awesome case. It is not as soft as I thought it might be. The size is perfect.
1,Really good case for a really good price. No need to spend more money.
1,It fit perfectly. Feels good in my hand. A little hard to remove but I don't do that often. Slides easily into the pocket in my purse.
-1,Didn't buy these on amazon but at one of those rip off cell phone stores.  My disappointment with this product is that it leaves big areas around the ear/lens section and button section exposed and uncovered.  The box picture doesn't depict this.
1,"Very well made, fits my Galaxy 6 perfectly. It maintains the slim profile of this phone by adding very little bulk. I don't use it as a wallet, bu I can highly recommend it as a secure, attractive carrying case for the S6."
1,"love it. works very well. I can lay in bed, and use this to hold my phone on my belly. awesome."
1,It's good but takes long time to charge
1,"Took a little patience to get the screen off, but this $15 investment was so much easier than spending over $100! !!!! Took about 15 minutes tops"
1,I love these just bought my second one they really protect your phone from more than just scratches. no bubbles very smooth it's like it's not even there. Can't ask for a better price either most of these sell for $10
1,Great
0,"The hinge started to crack and come apart quickly, and the rubber part that holds the ipad was slightly warped. Very cute hello kitty design though."
1,"The case is not as solid as I thought it would be, but it fits perfectly and slim."
1,Quick Honest Summary Review.<br /><br />1. Perfect fit. And will not raise a glass screen protector (if there is one on your phone)<br />2. Will Not turn your phone into a brick<br />3. Extremely durable (the kids drop my phone a lot)<br />4. Beautiful case<br />5. High quality materials and feels nice in hand<br />6. Buttons are easy to press<br />7. Connecting the charger or earphones is simple and even a generic charger or any earphone plug will fit.<br /><br />All in all its a great durable and stylish case that will protect your phone really good.<br />Seller was great & shipping was extremely fast<br />Thank you Seller and Amazon for another great purchase and product
-1,I'm not a big fan of this case. When I make calls no one can hear me. I have to always have my headphones in and it's just annoying that I don't even use the case anymore.
-1,This charger didn't charge my phone HTC M8.
1,Great value for the price and qty.
1,These are great for the budget price. I use them all the time for runs and they have been great!
1,"Brilliant no nonsense GPS, well worth the money."
1,I really liked the case. Before ordering I was thinking the quality would not be good but when I received I felt really good that I ordered as it is good quality wise as well. Now I'm thinking to order headphones but again lil doubtful lets see
1,"Cute, fits well.  Slippery in hands, though.  I've dropped my phone several times with it."
1,"I ordered one to try about a week ago and loved it. Not only is it constructed very well but those clips top and bottom are definitely not going anywhere when you clip them. It is very flexible and there is no stopping it when it comes to the position of viewing. The possibilities are endless. Hehe. Great viewing experience with either, my iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. No more achy hands and arms holding up cellphone for 2 hours. I clip anywhere and watch. My favorite is clipping it to edge of futon and voila, I just lay back comfortable and enjoy a good movie. I fell in love with this product that I went ahead and ordered a few days ago 2 more for my son and a friend. I highly recommend this product and for the price, you simply cannot beat it."
1,works fine
1,"Very thin case, main use is for looks"
-1,The wall adapter part of the charger works fine.  The wire however broke within a few days. I had to pull part of the cable out of the phone.
-1,"Doesn't fit exactly as it should. It sits just a little to far from the edges for my taste. My past tempered glass protectors were much less noticeable, but you can't look at this phone without seeing the protector.<br />In order for it to not hit the home button, it has to touch the front camera. It doesn't interfere with the camera, but it looks bad.<br />Plus it shows a terrible looking line of what i assume to be adhesive all the way around the edge that you cant miss."
-1,I had hard time to put on my iphone and to secure to my desk  clips are too hard to use
0,Nice cover
1,Fit perfect
-1,"Edit: 21-DEC-15 They thanked me for changing the review to four stars and then retracted the offer to the free stainless version. This time I'll be keeping the one star rating until I receive a product that does not rust. It was advertised as water sports. Kevin and Marty, No need to email me again and waste my time.   Edit: 20-DEC-15 I am editing my review to receive the new stainless version. This one should not rust. Hopefully.  Original: Used once on a one day boat trip. Rinsed with all my other gear and towel dried/ air dried. This is the only thing that rusted. Contacted their customer support and didn't hear anything back."
1,They work great!  Love how it came with all the different chargers.
1,"I love this case!!!  Being a fan of Tokyo Ghoul, I was hoping that I would somehow find a case for my phone that is from this anime.  I was extremely excited at finding this one.  It has all the characters, the art is fantastic, and it compliments my phone greatly.  I alternate between this one and my wolf wallet case for my phone, depending on my mood, but I absolutely love this!!!  The material is quite sturdy, it arrived in perfect condition, and it hasn't gotten damaged on me so far."
1,"This is my second version of this case. (First phone died, 100% unrelated to the cases' stability). Been the best, sleekest, slimmest, most attractive and &#34;natural&#34; case I've ever seen. (I buy an i-phone to have an i-phone, not a 10 lb utility box). The first one started to pull apart after a couple years, (probably because I am unnaturally hard on phones) and the company replaced it promptly, no questions asked. For a cheap case that lasted that long, I would've been happy to throw it away and buy another one, honestly.You CANNOT go wrong with this phone case. Period. The end. My phone had endured harrowing encounters on the weekly, and when I pull it out of the case (which is SO easy to do when needed for inserting in an armband, etc.) the phone is still immaculate. Stop wasting your life reading endless reviews and buy this case. You won't regret it."
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
-1,"Works perfectly fine but.....  1)I received a damaged touchscreen, there is a dark spot, the size of a water droplet, a blob of dead pixels.  2)There is also an extreme bright white spot on the lower part of the screen  3)When u turn on the lights for the 3 navigation buttons at bottom of the screen, light escapes from a little gap between the touchscreen and the frame."
-1,Suction cup fell off the first day
1,Arrived in two days.  Good quality charger
-1,Sound is ok. Not worth the price. Bluetooth disconnects constantly. Very unhappy with product.
1,:)
-1,Charging is good but durability is not there they only lasted about two weeks each
1,Exactly as described.;  totally satisfied.
1,"Everything fine, nice & useful as expected & good delivery service..."
-1,Do Not order this for the Galaxy Prevail LTE (SM-G360P). This case is WAY TOO SMALL. Not even close.
-1,"The concept is nice but it slowly fell apart in pieces, quality should be much better for the price. Would but again but only if quality was significantly improved/worth the money."
1,great
1,Alls well.  I just hated  the fact that my Samsung Galaxy SIII'S  media volume has and hasve been
-1,Sound quality is very poor compared to the 730. If you like listening to load music that sound great. Then get the 730. If you just like using them for talking then buy the 750.
-1,It was a stolen phone very dissatisfied
1,"It came exactly when they said it would, and worked perfectly."
1,Very easy to install
-1,The item worked great for two months.  Now the Bluetooth transmitter only sends out a mono signal.  Now I cannot use it for my main purpose of watching TV late at night when I can't sleep. The equipment was always used gently. It appears that the product is not made sturdy enough. If it had not broken I would give it a 5 star rating.
0,nice size soft touch works puts most pens don't either don't come out or don't write.<br />you get what you paid for
0,"I like that  you can put more in it then some,but the like pink decal fell off to easy:(sorry but I would not buy another"
1,It fit my Note 5 like it was suppose to. It's a great  product!!
1,Easy installation. It fits perfectly on my iPhone 5
1,As expected!
1,Charges and transfers without issues.
-1,BAD quality
0,I bought 2 one work one didn't work.
1,So far so good....
1,I love it ! It is a pretty nice case comes with all little functions such as opening /closing with magnet attached and pockets to hold your business cards or credit cards . Also It has a small window so your iPhone logo could display from the back...
-1,Did not like at all. Kept sliding and would not stay in place.
1,Very easy to install and works well even with a case on the phone
1,THIS IS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.  I NOW FEEL SAFE HOLDING MY PHONE ANYWHERE.  AND WATERPROOF TOO.
1,"Works perfectly, but would be nice if it had a longer cord."
-1,did not hold charge
1,"I enjoy the sleep function including the heart rate monitor.  Although I do not fell it is 100%accurate.  I wake up more thru the night than it records.  Being able to see my steps throughout the day is great and makes me consciously make better choices.  For example, taking the stairs vs the elevator. I have not used the function for recording food.  I like being able to see the results on my phone."
1,"It's great and a perfect fit for my tablet. The shipping date was not as exact, but the product itself is awesome"
1,"HANDS DOWN, BEST CELLPHONE CASE I HAVE EVER BOOT. Thanks!"
-1,Works for a couple hours and dies.
1,Suuuch a great case!!! I loved it. Will definately buy more in different colors. Great buy
-1,Lasted about a month.  No longer works
0,Charges quickly but constantly pops out of the outlet. Would not recommend.
1,great
-1,"Earplugs cord is very small,always face problem while talking on phone"
1,"Works great, the kids love rocking out in my car. This way I can pass my phone around for them to pick songs instead of it being tethered by aux cable.<br /><br />Start car, press button, start music, it's that easy."
1,"Very practical! Holds well my Galaxy S6, I take it with me mostly when I am traveling!"
-1,was broken very fast and not function.
1,works perfect
1,Perfect. Batteries hold charge well. Better than my q year old OEM samsung battery
1,Bought this 11/2014 and has worked great for nearly a year.  Would buy it again.
-1,The solar charger does not hold a charge. Not worth purchasing.
-1,"This case fits the phone correctly, and I like the overall appearance. However, it arrived in the wrong color (I ordered blue), and the case broke the first time I dropped the phone. Th case now has a sharp edge that catches on everything, so I had to buy another case. Disappointed."
1,"Awesome case, use it at the river and pool, verry good quality..."
1,It's absolutely beautiful and we'll made. I can't wait to use it.
1,Durable. Color is not as vibrant as the picture appears.
0,Great durable case. The glass broke within a week but overall the case is awesome.
1,Great phone! Everything is so smooth and the camera exceeded my expectation. Also cool that you can get a Gear VR and turn this phone into an amazing VR  kit.
1,This was for my 17 yr old daughter who has issues with dropping things etc. So far This phone has stood the test. As far as mechanics and features she seems pleased with it.
-1,bad quality
1,Well made product
0,You get what you payed for.
0,Difficult to charge with USB - you either have to remove the case to ensure the USB stays plugged​ in or just make sure you don't bump or move the phone and even then sometimes the cable comes off. Otherwise it served the purpose I bought it for.
1,Jesus Christ
-1,Not a lot of volume from this. Save your money.
-1,😋
1,Works great
1,"Very sturdy, plastic design. Not bulky. Very good charging speeds with my particular phone (Galaxy S4).<br /><br />Would highly recommend."
1,"This is absolutely perfect and what I was looking for. It attaches to the vent, I hook my phone on it and can move it any direction I need. LOVE LOVE LOve it"
1,[[VIDEOID:5dc7ce00bc2f2b2a013997093480213]]I have been looking for high quality clear case for my phone because I have a limited blue samsung galaxy s6 and I really want to keep my phone safe but also see it's attractive color.  This phone case is anti scratch and anti dust.  The cover really is impact resistant and made of a flexible plastic that was really easy to install and yet durable at the same time.  I wish this one came with a glass screen cover but for the price of this case I cannot complain.  I'm 100 % satisfied.  I did receive this case as a promotion so that I may leave my honest unbiased review.
1,"I don't get 11 hours of talk time but this fits well, is easy to use and very clear reception."
1,Great product. I have it for many different devices.
1,"So far so good, great product for the price though it does feel cheap but that doesn't matter because it delivers great sound!"
1,"It has fewer features than previous high end Garmin had. It is annoying that you cannot add custom POI icons, and simply have a few generic icons to choose from. On the plus side though, I can now easily find the local brothels during my travels..."
1,Perfect!
1,"I like it but it scratches up very easily. Better the case than the phone of course, but they could have made the case more scratch resistant. This case has saved my phone from a few small falls, but i don't know if it would save it from bigger falls... I'd buy it again, but i am looking at alternatives."
1,"Got this as a birthday gift, my friend loved it. Quick charging time which is a big plus"
1,I love my  Amazon
0,"Technically armband does what it says.  However, hard to get phone (with slim otterbox case) into/out of armband.  Phone with case also does not align well under plastic window, so it is not convenient to access phone screen.  Armband design also awkward."
1,Good product. Fast shipping.
-1,"For the price you can not really bet it, but you get what you pay for. It is kind of tricky to get the watch on it to start charging."
1,Great for now.  will see how they do as time progresses.
1,Great item!
1,"This is my second Microsoft Lumia phone. The XL is so much easier to read and I love the Dual Sim. This way I don't need another cell phone when travelling to Germany. The only drawback I see is that the android phones have so many more apps available. I miss playing Scrabble on the Microsoft phone, a great way to pass the time at airports or in doctor's offices. I do like the fact that the Microsoft phone was much more affordable than the Android phones I was considering. All in all I am happy with my purchase."
1,Impressed. Good quality and duarability.
1,"This is a very solid, durable case. My husband is a nurse and keeps his phone with him at all times and he loves this case. Only complaint is lack of color options for men (who dont want neon)."
1,I love it
-1,I wrote a review before saying it was great purchase but it was too early. The screen keeps going black all the time. Bad purchase don't not buy.
1,"Good smartphone, for Venezuela"
1,good product
1,"Why would i give them five stars?.First, their sound quality is very good. Secondly, they have noise cancelling system which is working perfect. Thirdly, their battery life is as described to their descriptions. I workouts everyday at evening and it supports me better. It's sweat proof. Little wire is so smooth. I feel comfortable to use this headphones. Fourth, bluetooth is working fine from far distance. Fifth, price is reasonable, any one can buy with this range. So, all over i can say that this bluetooth headphones is one of the best headphones ever."
1,Awsome phone for sis no scratch crack or dings
1,Very Good charge love it.<br />I will buy from this company again<br /><br />Thank you Q vigo Trading Company.<br />Keep up the Good Work.
1,I like how case has covers for all the important areas like headphone jack and charger port... I especially like the belt clip holster... the only issue have is when I put on a screen protector the case always seems to make bubbles on the edges and it's difficult to correlate how to fit the screen protector on without the case messing up the smoothness of it... other than that I can't complain...
-1,"I just tried to connect, and the connector that is inside the cover lifted off and was loose inside it. Im from Panamá and the only think that they can do is a replacement or a refund only if I send back the product, it will cost me more to return it. What a shame I was thinking this will be a good product"
1,Nice
-1,Very uncomfortable and sub par sound.
-1,If it gets hot in your car the suction cup will leave a very sticky residue on your windshield.
1,Love this mount. If there is any con at all it would be a pain to remove but 99% of people would manage just fine.
-1,When I got the case I was happy. But after a couple days I noticed  the exterior layer was peeling off. Would not buy from them !
1,This is a great product. I was searching all the possibilities to unlock my wife phone and after a video on YouTube this did the trick and al the hundreds of pictures were recover from her broken phone.
1,It was easy to put on and take off and has already saved the phone more than once
1,"perfect fit, great quality"
1,They worked and they were a good price.
1,Nice case.....textured on back...stays in your pocket
-1,"First one I received didn't work at all.  The second one works, but it sounds like gears are grinding when the face plate opens. The SD card slot wont recognize any memory greater than 4 gig.  The USB socket doesn't recognize my Android phone. Not even worth $100."
1,Great case! I get many compliments!!
-1,"The pins that extend from the band that slides in the watch (the pins that create the loop for the band) are very cheap and within a few minutes of having the watch on they came out. Seems to be of cheaper quality. The packaging was nice and it arrived quickly and the rose gold had good color to it, although it didn't pair as well with the Sport watch silver metal as I had hoped it would. The supplied adjustment tool to remove the pins was cheap but it got the job done and is a must have for DIY adjustments of the band. In summary, I just didn't feel comfortable having this band keep a $400 watch on my wrist."
1,"This is an amazing little receiver. Heist Mode allows 5 devices to all be connected simultaneously (but not playing) so that you don't have to keep pairing, connecting, disconnecting, and unpairing. Every other Bluetooth device I've ever owned has had issues with connections so that it needed to be routinely unpaired and repaired so that it would recognize that yes, it was supposed to be connected and doing something. The Moto Stream has no such problems. The use of microUSB for the power connector was also a great choice because it makes it easy to find a way to power it without needing to carry a separate barrel plug charger."
1,"This is a neat little case for the Galaxy Note 4.<br /><br />The one I received is a matte black with a red kickstand component on the back.<br /><br />I am always excited about new tech products to try out, especially for my Note 4, so I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. When it arrived, I immediately put it onto my phone.<br /><br />It snaps right onto the back on the phone, and all buttons or entry points for headphones and charges are easily accessible through the cutouts.<br /><br />The kickstand on the back can be easily manipulated so as to be able to put it in the exact position that you want it, with 5 different position points. The first, obviously being all the way closed, then 3 additional points. The last peg (or 4th) requires that the tab be completely looped against the back of your phone. If this sounds confusing, there will be photos to demonstrate.<br /><br />It does hold my phone up pretty well when being compared to other kickstand cases on the market.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't particularly like or appreciate about this case is that it provides little to no protection for your phone at all. There is no support other than the thin plastic backing itself. Also, when the kickstand is in use, the back of the phone is exposed through the kickstand track.<br /><br />What I love about this case is being able to charge my device without a USB cable, and even being able to sync it. The kickstand component has the feature to do this by plugging the end right into any charging port or USB port and plug the micro charging end into your phone.<br /><br />That being said, if you are careful with your phone, I think this would be a great accessory for your Note 4, but if you drop it a lot, you may be needing a new one with this case.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review. This is my honest and personal experience with this case."
1,"okay so i got this for my home made sound system for my house and i used this to replace a cheap sony sub and wow i also have 2 12s and this little 10 sounds better honestly, its more punchy and solid, i love it! when my 2 12s blow i'm getting the same type of speaker to match and have a way better sound system then anything i could hope for"
1,"Love this case!!  I didn't know the leg of the cup also served as a stand,  I glued it because it seemed weak and my phone is heavy and I did not want it to break. But it is such a cute case! For a great price. 👍"
1,"Cheap and functional, exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use, and keeps my phone safe."
1,This is a fine product. Well engineered and constructed of what appears to be quality leather. It is excellent protection for the phone while providing a useful grip that is attractive and feels good in the hand. I tired of the bulky units furnished by some of the companies. This gives the same level of protection without the bulkiness. The cover alleviates my concerns about &#34;butt dials&#34; while carrying the phone at the gym or other places. I would buy it again and will certainly consider it for gifting.
-1,One of the upper corners does not snap tight.
1,Inexpensive and serves its purpose.
-1,Doesn't work well. Comes off easily and bubbles after using.
0,This works  wonderfully  as a charger. The downside  is  that  it  gets stuck in the car and is very difficult  to  remove . I almost pulled the whole dash  out.
-1,The hinge is not really durable!
0,Great batteries like usual. Only gripe is the charger itself. The battery is a tad too long to fit perfectly into the slot on the charger.  Results into he battery having to be forced in and the pressure sometimes doesnlodges the battery from the charger.  Don't know why they always have to change the design of the charger. The spring one that came with the s2 battery was great. The charger for the note 3 was a perfect fit for the battery. This charger is poorly made. There have been several times I have come home to find the battery I was charging has &#34;popped&#34; out of the charger slot.
-1,It's a fraud. It doesn't fit to my ipad
1,"decent for the price.  I wouldn't say this is going to prevent a break if dropped from waist level on concrete, but its about what I expected.  I wanted something thin and with a bit of elasticity and this fit the bill."
0,Keep in mind I have two small boys that use my phone a lot and I rarely ever have the phone in a bag while out. I'm pleased that the case still is looking good for the most part after 3 months. No stones have fallen out. However the case has started to peel a bit on the hard part and the soft spots where you have a hole for a head phone jack have split. Still would give it a solid 3 stars and likely 4 had it help up just a little bit longer.
1,Great product so far.  Its see through exactly how i wanted.  Helps to show off the phone.
1,"love it!!  Fits my LG G4 perfect, lightweight, glitter is really cute got many compliments. Keeps my phone safe."
1,Great!
1,"Awesome mount, excellent quality"
0,"I liked the concept of this phone case/wallet, but the magnate was not very strong on the closure piece and so it would fall open frequently."
-1,One of the cords suddenly quit working within 2 weeks of purchase
1,"This is a good case for the price.  I needed something fast to protect my phone.  Since there weren't many options for the leather back LG G4, I grabbed this until I found something nicer.  It has held up nicely.  Also it has a stand that snaps into place and holds tight."
1,So compact and sleek with a lot of power!!
1,"Wonderful case. I broke my other one myself and made another order that evening, I love theses cases because they are not expensive and very tough. I would recommend this product to anyone , I love it"
1,"I've got an 10 year old truck and I listen to podcast. So I needed a way to listen while driving without the use of headphones. I've always had good experiences with Jabra and I can count this as one of them. Its also great for making and taking phone calls, I just have it clipped to my visor.<br />The only negatives and why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the volume were a little louder. You won't be able to use this if you have your windows open.<br />Also keep in mind that if you have to use your visor in the down position, the unit will be between your windshield and your visor unless you figure out a different mount. The clip is pretty sturdy, enough so that it isn't that easy to just unclip and reclip on the inside of the visor. it almost requires 2 hands."
1,Works great with my Garmin 360. I set it on my work truck's dashboard. It doesn't move.
1,Finally a product that looks and functions exactly as it looks in the picture! It was right on time. Couldn't be happier!
1,"Has two slots for cards. At first seemed right fit but loosened and was easier to slide in cards later on, Also with money. Magnet hold it close pretty well as long as not too full. Great quality made, fits the phone perfectly. Didn't use stand much but works, just have to adjust at times."
-1,I was really disappointed by the volume capability of this speaker. It's not very loud at all. I returned this product.
1,Great case for our son's first phone. We're not worried about accidental drops!
1,ok
1,"I bought these to replace the factory rear 6x9's in my 2008 pontiac G6. They sound so much better and i'm just running the stock head unit with no amp. I've been a Polk guy for over 20 years but couldn't find any that had the bass i wanted according to all the reviews i read unless i wanted to drop an additional $100 , which i did not. So after reading up on these JBL's i took the chance and i am glad i did. I can only imagine how great they'll sound when i get the amp im saving up for installed."
1,"These offer me a sense of protection with my Fitbit -- I don't worry that it will fall off unexpectedly.  Additionally, the bright colors are a nice spark of happiness for my otherwise dull black Fitbit."
-1,Feels cheaply made and its huge!!! I got this for running so that I wouldn't have to remove my case (Spigen Tough Armor).  It's a decent size case and this band is still too big. The phone bounces all around when moving.
1,Great
1,"I bought two of these since the price was right.  I figured that at least one of them would die fairly quickly, and that would leave me with one good one to depend on.  They have both been flawless to date, and I have had no trouble with them whatsoever,  The size and shape make them easy to pack and store while your not using them, but still gives a good feel in the hand while you are plugging things in.  The only possible drawback is that with it's enormous storage capacity, it takes a while to fully charge, but I can only curse physics for that."
-1,"Protector only seals to the watch around the center of the watch face and leaves raised areas around the edges. JETech sent me an email offering 100% satisfaction (&#34;For any reason&#34;) and then replied with an offer of a 50% refund when I replied with a return request. I'm no mathematician, but something doesn't add up here. This product made my watch look completely cheap and took away the sleek look and lines that Apple intended. See photos in other reviews."
1,Got delivered quickly.  I used for about two weeks now and had no problems.  Perfect length with the RC and my iPad or phone. I recommend this product.
1,I like how this worked and I didn't have any issues. Made me aware of my activity so I picked it p a notch.
1,"Very happy with the case overall, but there is one small problem. Aux cords will not fit in the headphone jack. In order to make them fit I had to trim some of the plastic off my Aux cord with a knife so it was thin enough to fit."
1,So cute and great for iphone user! I bought one for my friend and wow it saved us so much time!
1,It looks exactly like the Picture! I wouldn't recommend this case if you're wanting a lot of protection. It is very pretty and I do like it a lot!
-1,Not working at all .
1,Worked perfectly keeping my failing Garmin GPS battery charging. Other adapters failed to do this.
1,Everything works great!
0,it won't charge after 4 months
-1,It only lasted 2 months and now it doesn't work at all. It doesn't charge or anything. :(
1,Just what I needed and fast delivery
1,The product arrived shortly after ordered and this one actually works unlike the other charger I ordered.
-1,"Buttons don't work properly, at all. Don't buy it. The only thing it is truly useful at is being car charger."
1,Definitely strong enough to protect my phone. Looks great with gold. Plenty of padding for back lens. Kick stand rocks
-1,"Pros:<br />Huge right out the box, did not know it would be as big as it was.Great for streaming shows and movies.<br />Cons:<br /> The front camera is horrible, even in good lighting.<br />The rear camera is very exposed which allows it to be easily scratched on surfaces, I cant even see out of mine anymore and i have never dropped my phone.<br />The screen is cheap. 7 inch screen should have Gorilla glass or something to protect it. The entire middle of my phone is unusable because the screen has caved in, which now makes it a 6 inch screen.<br /><br />I had hoped that when they made the Studio 7 II that they would improve on the camera and screen but unfortuantly they didnt, its basically the same exact phone. Save your money. I prefer the Life Pro ot Vivo Selfie if you want to stick with BLU and stay in budget, both have better cameras and designed better in quality."
-1,"Compared to other reviews I felt like maybe I am missing something? The case seems to be cheaply made. The slots for the cards is very thin, and as I'm sliding cards in/out, I am finding that my cards are getting stuck. As I'm removing my cards the very thin, non-leather nylon /poly part (grey in pic) is super thin, and very loose. I'm not sure if it's because it is not glued down all the way.<br />The actual phone part, is hard to place your phone in, or remove your phone from.<br />The quality feels soft, but does not feel or smell like real leather. I do not recommend this product if your looking for something of decent quality. I received this product at a promotional price, in exchange for my honest review."
1,Great product!
1,My Samsung S4 fits nicely and delivery timing was good.
-1,The case is already breaking...not satisfied
0,"It works pretty well, it's makes my music sound better and I got 2 amplifiers.."
-1,"Weak design. belt clip tore off after several weeks, first on I had tore off after two months."
1,arrived right on time.  so pretty fits great!
-1,not durable. soon you may need to buy new one. teared at the charge point.
1,Loud. Fits good
1,its the right size and i love the color
1,"I tested this product out by charging my LG G3.  I was was fast, not surprisingly so but, good.  It is compact, lightweight and perfect for travel.  I love that my husband and I will be able to charge out phones at the same time if needed.  I like that I do not need my phone charger and can use the USB that comes with this one.  A big plus is that it has a surge protector inside to sustain reliable power.  I do not see any negatives to this product.<br />Sample provided"
1,"This is the best cell phone case I have ever bought, I have dropped my phone 100's of times and it's perfectly safe."
1,"Great product.  Looks great and best of all, sounds great.  Everyone at work wants one now.  Worth every penny!"
1,Okay. I used to store the phone.
-1,Holes don't match exactly
1,Expectacular
-1,Not great quality. Don't  like the way you have to hook it up.
0,Bought for added protection for my phone. Was a little put off by seeing the lines where the cover ended. Dropped my phone a few times and it did protect the screen but had cracks that were sharp to the touch.
1,Received Jam Box<br />Coupled with Bluetooth without issue<br />Sound is awesome!!
1,"I am definitely satisfied with this product. The first time I used this was when I had a long road trip. I thought it will only last 10hrs, but the battery can be used almost a day which includes texting, calls, watching, surfing, playing. It really makes me enjoy my phone much better and longer comparing to the original Samsung battery I had. This saves me a lot of ways in a very good price. The case also fits very well and very good looking. Highly recommendable. Five star!"
1,Excellent all-around product with great pricing and shipping time frame actions.
1,Sender provided extra goodies and that's always a plus.
1,"Got them as a gift and they're great! Perfect for physical activity, they stay in your ears, and just throwing in your bag quickly because they don't tangle."
1,Very nice protective case for I phone 6 plus. I dropped my phone 2 times and no damage. Easy to put on looks nice and not bulky. I like!!!
1,Tested on a 5hr flight on two different airplanes. ANC works; greatly minimized jet engine drones. Liked the open mic feature. It even enhanced the clarity of the announcements. BT4.0 even showed battery life in my mobile phone. Good soundstage. Clear highs. Balanced mid and low range. Highly recommended.
1,Husband loves it
-1,Ears getting pain if i use more then  5 min
1,"This case is awesome it take a couples of times to mess with it but this case works fine charges my phone to 100% in a couple of hours ,also the seller has great customer service so he's very well a great seller"
1,"I found the case I wanted at the price I was willing to pay. Then came choosing the design, which in itself was kinda fun. When I saw the design I chose, it was immediately recognizable as the correct choice for me. When I saw the name of it, &#34;Owl&#34;, that was instantly recognizable as incorrect. I is a CAT. When I opened it, it was apparent it is no ordinary cat, but the CHESHIRE CAT. I love it and have gotten more &#34;Where'd you get that? It's so cool!&#34; comments about it than anything else I own."
-1,"This battery charger actually BROKE my better, original battery. After putting the original battery in this charger, the battery stopped working completely. I wanted to get a refund, but I wasn't able to since the original battery was destroyed and I had no other batteries on which to rely, and the return window was extremely short. Terrible made in China knock off product.  Update: The charger itself broke just over 3 months after I received it."
1,Works great
1,"Great product.  Has a little trouble switching between phones, but purchased two"
-1,it took forever to get them. would not have ordered them if i knew they were from China. While waiting I bought 3 other ones with the mesh tip. i love these ! Will use the other ones as back-up ! At a $1.52 for ten it was a bargain. Too exspensive to send back all the way to China !
1,Lightning fast shipping!!! product as promised!! THANK YOU
1,This is really cool and does what it is supposed to do. It seems quite durable!
-1,"After use, break from usage and unrepairable."
-1,Worst Case I Ever Bought ! Bad Print And Its Cut Horribly.
0,Large and awkward to install and use
1,Only had them for a day but I'm impressed. Way better sound (especially low frequencies) and fit than my old Motorola SD-10s. Battery life seems good at several hours. Haven't tested mic and Siri yet. This is the first pair of Bluetooth headphones that I've owned that actually have any bass. For the price you will not be disappointed.
1,Very pleased with purchase. Sturdy and perfect fit.  Attractive and nicely made.
1,Error size
-1,"I am using this phone from one month and I have to say I am really disappointed. With all the big hardware it has, the phone has heating issues if you use internet a lot, do screen mirroring with TV etc. You will also feel a lag while browsing apps and the phone also gets slow."
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
1,"I love this phone!  Does everything, and more, that I wanted in a phone.  I had the LG 306G, which in of itself is a great simple phone, but this Alcatel OneTouch rivals any phone out there.  It's perfect!"
1,Excellent product!!
1,Very pretty and is slim (not bulky).
1,good
1,"Great sleek feel. With an extremely long lasting battery, saved my life countless times in situations where I needed my phone but couldn’t get to a charger nearby."
1,"Thin, looks nice but not too durable I doubt"
1,Awesome
1,Good quality and outlook making the phone heavier
-1,Unit was warped.  iPhone wouldn't snap in.
1,Nice case. Just as described.
0,the Bluetooth shuts off alot and you have to reset it with a toothpick that kind a sucks
1,Works perfectly.
1,Nice case and fits the phone well!
-1,The lips and lipstick broke the same day. I tried to glue it but was unsuccessful.
1,"I really like this product it feels really smooth, the touch works perfect, easy installation and its really good quality so your iPhone screen will be protected."
1,I love this the price was better than in the store and it sounds clear.
1,bought 2 one for my dad and husband. Both are not the most tech savy but I think it is a great phone for an awesome price.
1,Perfect for my needs. Now I can keep my life proof case on.
1,Excellent device. All OK
1,The best!
1,I like the phone.
1,"* I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. *<br /><br />I've had several different versions of backup chargers, but unfortunately I often forget to recharge them after use, so without a power source (which of course would illiminate the need for the backup in the first place) they become temporarily useless. I love the idea of this solar powered power bank. I camp a lot and I think this would be perfect for keeping my phone charged in case of emergency. I also like the idea of keeping it in my car. In order to charge the unit for the first time, I actually left they unit on my dashboard for an afternoon while I was driving around doing errands. At about 75% full according to the LED lights, I hooked up my phone (a Samsung Galaxy s5) and it charged easily and pretty quick. I did check a couple of notifications while it was charging the phone, but it still gave me about 20% additional charge. Not ideal testing circumstances, but still plenty to buy me some time with, or I imagine in an emergency, it would allow for at least a phone call or a few. Of course, I also like the environmental aspect of having a solar charger, I hope that the technology continues to improve so more products like this become more widely available. The carabiner that came with it for attaching to a bag or for hanging is a great idea, but I found the one included was too small to fit or hang well on the actual unit. It also doesn't feel very strong, so I'd be afraid it might bend or break. I plan to add my own larger one so that I can keep this clipped or otherwise easily accessible. Great idea, and an easy to use alternative option to standard back up chargers."
1,Love my new phone case. Beautiful
0,Pretty good. Just a little slow reaction time and downloading new maps could be a little less cumbersome.
-1,"After suffering the vagaries of cheap aftermarket cables, I decided to go with the Honeywell brand (having used their industrial products).  This thing died in less than 6 weeks. Figuring out how to contact these people to demand a replacement.  Disappointed."
-1,"it has a lot interference when playing. I had to eject and reloaded again and again. Finally, I tossed it in a trash can. Worst mo money spent on Amazon so far."
1,👀
-1,This did not work at all. I purchased 2 and was completely disappointed. One could be a lemon but neither worked.
1,Good
0,The pellests fall down
1,Great for my Desk. Really like it.
0,The promo code for this item did not work. Wish i was able to try this for my tab.<br />My mom has one for hers and she uses it everyday.<br />She received hers at a discount for her honest review.
1,Nice case
1,I need a new cable
-1,"I was accepted to review this case. I was going to give this as a gift. However the code didn't work. I emailed the seller, and still nothing."
1,Great phone case. Provided excellent protection.
1,"Lightweight, sturdy, and easy to hold. Perfect for general protection."
1,"only good if your phone won't charge like mine, honestly I just got this because my old galaxy s3 was my dedicated music player"
1,"For what it is, it's great. Moved kid from a flip phone to this and he is happy. Works as expected."
1,Came just as I expected.  It fit my phone unlike the last phone case I ordered it did not fit and is still sitting in the envelope it came in
1,yet too receive but i seen the same one at best buy for an amazingly higher price soo i do know the quality its five stars
1,"Gave this to my wife to use in her car and she's very happy with it. Great that it has the double outlets and like the light indicating when it's got power (not all cars work when turned off, so it reminds us when it's not working).<br />Happy with build quality and no problems with it."
1,I was happy to receive it and it's working fine I'm happy
1,Everything about this works and looks great. The sound quality is ok but for the price what can you ask for. I left my phone in another room and the bluetooth still worked. Much better than I expected.
1,Does its job... With putting it on my OCD self makes it harder than it really is! i like how there are multiple protectors for 3rd times a charm and for future savings
1,"They came just the way they look in the pictures! I was so excited to get them and the way the stylus' were, just made the expererience even more exciting."
1,Everything was as described. Thanks
1,very versatile loved it and cheap
1,"Works great, seems like all the parts are well constructed. And the cords are thick."
0,"Would work great if I didn't have a case that doesn't allow the phone to sit all the way down in the cradle to make enough contact to charge and such.  As such, I had to send it back as I want the case more than the dock."
1,Excellent and durable case
1,I love the dictionary cover! It protects my phone. The credit card slots and pocket works well with what I need.
1,good price
1,It's good quality but a little bulky.  I like something slimmer.  Still it's nice for the money.
1,Love it!
1,"I think this power adapter works well, but I only had it a couple months before my Google Nexus 7 stopped taking a charge.  However, the problem is with my device and not really with this adapter.  It's solid, it's one piece, and it does what it says it's supposed to."
-1,It cracked in the corner with the slightest pressure I dropped it and it shattered my phone and the adhesive in the corners do not stick
1,I love it so much! Really does resemble the photos perfectly. Everything about it is the same. It's definitely silicon and soft. if you're looking for a cute case then you've found it! It's not protective bc of the silicon though obviously but hey every now & then you have to treat yourself to something nice for your 6!
-1,"You get what you pay. It charges my Nexus 5 way too slow, one cable broke after less than one week, and some of these cables can't transfer data. I bought other more expensive cables and the other cables worked as expected, but these ones are just bad. Invest in better quality cables rather than quantity, hope this tip helps anybody."
1,Video Review<br /><br />https://youtu.be/czpJMiKOveE
1,My husband loves these.
-1,It serves its purpose.
-1,"I am very sad abut this, but I am extremely dissatisfied about this Up24 from Jawbone.<br />After having worked perfectly during almost a year, Two weeks ago the band just stopped working and it would take any charge anymore.<br /><br />I was expecting this to work for at least a couple of years."
1,"works perfect, give me 4g full bars in areas where i normally have no signal. I have owned 4 of the 3g versions and will stick with Wilson."
-1,Super cheap cracked in two weeks
1,"With everything having the ability to charge via USB ports, thus handy device transforms your wall outlet into a super easy to use charging station!"
1,Cable is a bit short as it says but it does the job.
1,"This is a pretty good drive cam. Below are my thoughts.<br /><br />*** POSITIVE ***<br /><br />* Includes a good SanDisk 32GB card. At the settings I used (1920x1080/1080FHD) , It takes about 188MB for 2 minutes or 94MB per minute, so 32GB gives about 5.5 hours of record time which is pretty good in my opinion.<br />* The suction cup is strong when mounted properly.<br />* The size of the camera is good, but there are even smaller ones.<br />* Audio quality is pretty good... better than another drive cam I have.<br />* The wide 150 degree field of view seems just right for a drive cam.<br />* Video quality during the day and night is good... video is smooth. I had no problems sticking the micro SDHC card into an SD adapter then into an SD card reader and then playing the recording video with Windows Media Player.<br />* The camera can be set to automatically come on when power is supplied and start recording (with a delay of 0, 10, 20, or 30 seconds), and then to turn off automatically when power is lost. The built-in battery allows you to keep recording after power loss for 0, 10, 20, or 30 seconds (it's one of the options).<br />* Once setup properly it should work without any maintenance (the way it should be) as it keeps a rolling video record.<br />* Nicely packaged and boxed.<br />* Comes with a one year &#34;hassle - free&#34; warranty that can be extended by 6 months if you register your product.<br /><br />*** NEGATIVE ***<br /><br />* Perhaps I got a defective power cord, but I had some serious issues getting a stable power connection plugging the power cord into a car power outlet. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and assume something was wrong with my power cord so I won't deduct much for this.<br />* The camera caught reflections on the windshield... it would be better if this camera had a polarized lens or filter to reduce the reflections... or positioning the lens closer to the windshield would probably help too.<br />* While playing around and reviewing some photos, it crashed and locked-up (but this is the only time I experienced a lock-up).<br /><br />*** OTHER ***<br /><br />* It's hard to read license plates unless the car is right in front of you but this is typical for cameras of this resolution<br />* Don't forget to remove the protective film over the lens<br />* I thought about uploading some video from the drive cam but Amazon wouldn't show it in a resolution that does it justice. You may want to search YouTube for videos that preserve the image quality that this drive cam is capable of.<br />* The camera is somewhat easy to remove from the mount. My other drive cam is easier to remove... but you probably won't be removing it much anyway.<br /><br />Overall 4 stars. Not a bad camera at all if your power cord works well and you don't mind the other, relative minor, negatives.<br /><br />NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.up).  *** OTHER ***  * It's hard to read license plates unless the car is right in front of you but this is typical for cameras of this resolution * Don't forget to remove the protective film over the lens * I thought about uploading some video from the drive cam but Amazon wouldn't show it in a resolution that does it justice.

-1,"This was super easy to apply! I loved it!<br /><br />That being said, after a week of it going from my back pants pocket, to my purse (I keep it in its own pocket so nothing will scrape it), it has at least seven scratches and/or cracks. This glass is incredibly frail. I've never dropped my phone, and the screen protector I had before was plastic (the only reason I replaced it was because it started to curl at one corner). Honestly, I think I'd be better off putting it in an otter box case to keep it safe. I may order this again, or maybe a higher quality because I really adore my glitter waterfall case that's on my iphone. I'm just sad that it looks so beat up so quickly."
1,"Very nice stand. Nothing fancy but effective. Is a bit heavy, so chances are it will not fall with the watch :)<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this unit and a price is a plus. Ended up buying 2 of them (black & silver) both are nice."
1,It protects your phone great but the case gets dirty after like a week or two
0,"At first I thought these headphones were positively amazing. I got them for the price of $80 and I loved how comfortable they were, how light they were, and how nice they sounded (I'm no audiophile just a normal high school-er who hates apple quality headphones). After awhile though the left head piece kept popping off and eventually it wouldn't stay together for more than a few minutes. At the moment I'm trying to figure out how to get my warranty but the process is just so confusing. I will come back if I can figure out how this warranty works but for the moment the problem seems like its just on my end and no one else. All in all I really liked these headphones and I desperately want them fixed."
0,They're lightweight. The soft buds are comfortable. The connection is sporadic with my iPod. The wire splits too close to face and is too short.
1,"It's long, durable & charges fast. The only downside is it doesn't fit in when you have a thick case on your phone. I made mine work,but it was a bit of a hassle. Still really love this charger though"
1,I got this in mail on time as expected delivery date. The speaker work well the down fall is it do not come with an charger.
1,This screen protector is so useful! A must get!
-1,Your product is bulls***. Overheats the charger and phone within minutes. I WILL figure out how to return your POS charger.
1,Bought it for my daughter and she likes it
1,"Awesome. Recharges my phone 4 or 5 times, my tablet almost 3 times and fits in my purse"
1,"[[VIDEOID:707cf6246cd1ab02536589a3e25d71c3]]I am forever losing (and leaving behind) my wall plugs. So I opted for these as they came in a set of two. Honestly I need one for every room in the house as I'm attached to my phone and charging is something of a routing throughout the day.  What I loved about these is the indentations on the side. They made it easy to plug and unplug- I was able to grasp it with minimal slippage when removing them from the outlet. They are small and compact- easy to toss in bag or pocket for traveling. They arrived in a simple but basic packaging but truthfully I liked the less packaging- less waste. Now I have a little concern with them getting `warm', however all my gadgets are plugged into surge protectors for extra security. Overall my phone charges just fine and I now have two more to replace the ones that magically disappeared. I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  #TQR"
1,Like it very well.
1,This wallet/wristlet is wonderful. The magnet that holds the phone to the wallet is very strong. There are several credit card slots and enough room to hold more than one card. The leather is soft and it is very smooth. I love this wallet.
-1,Doesn't work don't waste ur money
-1,The case will not stay closed and the phone doesn't sit well in the case. It looks better than it works.
1,Very cute.
1,Great
1,"The graphics could've been better, it was nice tho!! 😍"
-1,First time arrived broken so I requested a replacement which arrived cracked as well. I don't believe thIs product can protect my screen.
1,does the job - worth it
-1,It falls apart after a little bit.
1,Excellent!!!
1,works great
-1,Not comfortable.The wires are too stiff and wide to make the earbuds feel invisible.
1,"I used all summer, super good."
-1,It did not work properly.
1,Wife is happy
1,Excellent product and price.
1,Great little speaker for the money. Have synced it to my iPhone and iPad. It really puts out some sound. Great value too. I have played music on it inside the house with the windows open and can hear the music outside. It can be played very loud without distortion of music. Going to take it in my Polaris RZR on a trail riding trip and use it with my phone. Cheaper and easier than wiring a stereo in it. Very happy with this purchase! Like how the speaker is so portable.
0,It's good.
1,Arrived quickly. I would order again but the price has went up 20 dollars but the one i installed works well.  My screen is broke again though. Could be faulty
1,"This is the best screen protector I have ever used. I followed the directions for application closely. At first there were a number of bubbles and I was worried that they wouldn't go away, but I watched, and each day there were fewer bubbles. By the fourth day, there were no bubbles and the cover is flat and easy to see through. This is not this flimsy plastic like other screen protectors. It is more like window tint for vehicles. I would recommend that you purchase this and be patient...the bubbles will go away. Just follow the directions. The wait is worth it."
1,Great! really scratch protective.
1,These units are very well made and I was pleased that they were packed in a loop/ring as to not be all tangled together.  Very nice and so far holding up well. Colors are good also and do come in handy.
1,Great experience
-1,A Tom Tom will not fit in this model. I found out the hard way.
-1,"All 5 ports charge my iPad while in use, both outlets work and its definitely nicer than having 4 wall chargers plugged into a power strip.  So far so good.  Update 3/18/2016 still working great.  Update 12/20/2016 now 100% worthless, ports deliver a maximum of 300 ma, unless I plug in 3 or more devices then its even less."
1,Love these cases they are light and easy to use.. Very light on the belt and doesn't feel like it's weighing down ur pants...they are great!
1,"i'm really happy to receive this case with a discount for review.  I tend to buy my cases on eBay but the quality is pretty sub-par there.<br />This case is really nice, well made, sturdy material.<br />It's nothing fancy but it is sturdy, well made (the stitching is fantastic!)<br />But the one thing I thought would be useless is instead the best feature, that strap!  I used it this morning at a pet adoption event (the iPad), I just happened to stick my hand under the strap for comfort and was flicking through the pictures on the iPad to show a potential adopter and was sideswiped by one of our 'moose' dogs - lost my footing but didn't fall over and realized had I not had my hand under the strap, the iPad would have gone flying.<br />We are all volunteers and the tools that we use like iPads/tablets, phones, etc  to help use show people our dogs are at our own expense and this would have been an expensive lesson for sure.<br />I came back to review and to buy a red one which isn't available right now so I'm putting this in my cart and keep an eye out for red."
1,"Very well constructed. I'm not a big selfy guy in public, but I purchased this for my GoPro, intending on using it for high angle shots. Timely delivery, I was very pleased with the construction and quality of the stick. Nice grip surface, WiFi case, and firm clamps for size adjustment. The bonus of the phone clamp came in handy during a family vacation. My teen daughter and wife both loved it, and I couldn't get it back from them till we were home. I have other Smatree products, all high quality, and this is no exception. Highly recommend if you need a versatile stick."
1,Good
1,Best for the price! I love Anker products
1,"Awesome charger, powers up my phone really fast. Thanks"
1,I love it! It makes your phone more comfortable to hold. And keep it safe.
1,Decent.  Not OEM but a close 2nd.
1,"Superb...<br />Great case, good protection, feels great in your hand, and a [low price]... what more can you want from a case???"
1,I bought two of these and couldn't be happier. I plug my phone in and drive 30 minutes to work and it can charge my battery from 10% to nearly 60-70% very rapid charging!
0,Does the job like any other cable. It can always be a little longer.
-1,This product did nor protect my screen. My phone slipped out my hand and the screen protector cracked right along with my screen.
1,Good product
1,Thought it would be more 'rubbery'
1,Love it.
-1,"Well, I bought one, and it worked fine for a few months. But I dropped my phone, and the screen cracked, not the screen protector. very disappointing. Woulnd't buy another one."
1,Nice colors and seems to be working perfectly
0,"It's a hard shell case with rubber sides that line the edge of the screen. The wave pattern in the back adds some texture but not enough. I found myself still tightly holding my phone just in case. The back protects the camera well.<br />Overall, this case does okay. It will protect your phone from minor drops and bumps but its smooth design causes it to slide on desks and other flat surfaces."
1,Just got mine today love it 😁
1,"fits great, nice and slim. I usually like to go naked but this is next to it. Plastic is of high quality soft touch material. Easy to clean. Great price!<br />Thinking of buying a couple more for back ups. Would recomend to iphone 5 owners becuase of the squared chamfered edges."
1,Mounted easily to trolling motor. Crystal clear display on my fish finder with no distortion from trolling motor.
1,Love this! Charges all of our stuff
1,Very good one first time i buy a selfie stick<br />And i am happy with this purchase!
-1,"Unfortunately,  these reviews come in after I purchased the screen protector.  This is misleading as it does not cover the entire screen.  What a waste of time waiting for this to be delivered."
1,Love it so far.
1,The Spigen stand is very stable and holds the watch in place firmly.
1,"At first look it just looks like a regular phone case, but then when you look at it closer you notice that there is a place for your cards<br /><br />I'm able to hold 3 credit cards and a folded up bill in it.<br /><br />Does what it needs to do!"
1,love how it holds the phone and keeps it from the sweat moisture
1,"Nice. Good quality look and feel. Lighter than expected. Charged 3000mah note 5 from 20% to 100% in under 2 hours, with light Web browsing for some of that time. After that, the charger still shows 2 of 4 LEDs on the meter.<br /><br />So far, couldn't expect more.<br />As long as it proves durable over time, great product."
-1,"I was looking into Bluetooth earbuds and these had good ratings.  In fact, nothing negative.  Which is very unusual. And all of the reviews were very brief, and most included shipping and packing accolades.<br /><br />I was suspicious of all of these 5 star ratings so I took a look at the majority of the reviewers.  Low and behold, it's amazing the vast majority never posted before the date of their review.<br /><br />In what I suspect to be a means to add legitimacy to their reviews, some have two or three items listed, however they are reviewed on the same date as their review for this product.<br /><br />And what really leads me to suspect most of these are bogus reviewers many of them have purchased the exact items.  Sorry, too much of a coincidence for me."
1,Love this. Prettier than the pictures
1,item just exactly as was described .. i love it look like a brand new phone
1,Sturdy yet flexible makes it to install
1,Looks just like original brand name LG.
-1,Did not like at all did not fit the phone and the clip was way to big
0,"If I had to give a one-word description of this case It would be &#34;minimalist&#34;. And, that was the main reason I purchase this particular case. I wanted something that would fit in my pocket. But the thin and sleek profile comes at a cost. The phone is held in place by pressure fit of the corners and a narrow lip along most of the right edge. Consequently the phone tends to pop out with even the slightest drop. I don't believe this case offers a great deal of protection if you are prone to drop your phone often.<br /><br />Build quality appears good and I like the magnetic closure on the flap. The buttons are easy to access and the whole bottom of the phone is exposed which means I can rest this phone in my cradle with the case on. That's a real bonus since all other cases required me to take the phone out of the case before mounting it in my charging cradle/clock radio base.<br /><br />As long as you know what you're getting yourself in for this should be a fine case. I would like to give a higher than a 3 star rating but the grip on the phone is just a bit too light."
1,Great!
-1,"None of them worked with iPad Air 2, IPhone 5 or 6."
-1,This worked for s couple of weeks then the clip that holds the case together broke.
1,Loved it
1,"Had to send back as didn't fit my phone completely, but nicely made."
1,Not satisfied with the charge time it's better then some but what was expected but the looks are great looks nice and great size
1,"I like this phone case. It looks similar to the color of my phone without the case.  It's not bulky and is easy to remove. I have dropped it a couple of times and haven't had any pieces chip off the corner. It is a thicker plastic, so I am happy with it"
1,This is really a great quality product. I definitely  recommend it.
1,Loveeeeeeee it
0,The sticky back doesn't hold
1,Works as advertised...even backed up iPhone with no problem.
1,It's a good charger however there's no charger to charge the case.
1,Ridiculously high quality. Very strong/secure. Have been using this with my Olympus TG-4 camera.
0,the package was supposed to have 10 bands but only contained 9 rings.  AND one of them was damaged.........And Getwow has refunded me part of the cost of this product.  Thank you!  They are working out great with my fitbit bands.
1,Thank you!
1,"This case protects my phone great. I know it's not waterproof, and neither is the phone, but I dropped my phone in the river yesterday while fishing and the case kept my phone dry and my phone didn't get damaged at all. I'd definitely would recommend this case for this phone."
1,Love it!
1,Works fine. No problems at all
1,good
1,Fits my iPhone perfectly! Very happy with this purchase.
1,"Shipping took a while but it works great! The one thing is that it can't hold your phone vertically, so if you want to do that you have to twist its little octopus legs a lot and have your horizontally-clipped phone held sideways... doesn't work great but it'll do in a pinch. For most of my horizontal-phone recordings (widescreen style), works great!"
-1,Did not work for my phone (samsung galaxy legend) despite it being in the product title. the plug fit in the phone but the phone never charged. waste of money.
1,"For me it's the best camera ever, it allows me to capture every moment while having a good time."
1,It gets high marks from my 2 teenage girls.  It also gets a workout!!
1,My wife loves loves loves this case. It fits perfect and has held up great over the last 8 months. People stop her all the time telling her they love the color.
0,doesn't block noise like old one
1,Is good but it will peel screen protector when clip to the holster.
1,very good case.
1,i like the design but the volume was not loud enough for me. the headset last most of the day and the play or talk time is about 4 hours<br /><br />the recharge light is ok. the first one i had the red charging light was kind of dim
1,Just what I needed. thanks for the good customer service.
1,"The title says it all. This is by far my favorite bag I have used. When I opened the package, I examined the bag and seemed to be sealed. I then put a couple cotton balls inside and soaked in in water for about 5 minutes. I opened the bag and they were dry! What makes this better than others is that it's easy to open and close. One of the bags I had before was hard to close. You had to turn these knobs and it would never work. With this it's much different. It easily seals and opens without water coming in. Also, it includes a neck strap and armband to make it easier to carry. I really like this product for the beach. It keeps the sand, salt, and water out. It basically keeps the phone in a seal and confined space, protecting it from water, dirt, sand etc..."
-1,"Battery worked good for about 3 weeks, then the case split open and all functions stopped.  Battery seems to be very susceptible to heat damage, as I charged it in the velour pouch they give you to carry it in, the case separated and functions stopped."
1,Water damaged phone wouldn't charge.  Fast swap and great price. The phone now works.
0,Had to clip down the volume buttons. They were too long and kept pushing the volume either up or down with the slightest touch.
1,very good
1,CUTE case and worked perfectly
-1,Band runs smaller than what comes with the Fitbit.  Band breaks and the Fitbit can fall out.
1,Worked great!
1,"This product completely meets my needs. It provides protection for the back and corners, fits tightly, is very lightweight, provides a nice transparent casing to show off the iPad, and provides a firm grip when working on the iPad on one hand. It is ideal for In-home use, and if I need more protection for outside trips, I have a zipped case that this fits nicely into."
1,Works great at a great price.
1,"Awesome product! Plugged right in and started listening to music off my iPhone. Also realized there is an adapter to charge as well built into the device, bonus! My last one I purchased from Best Buy for $40. This one is a fraction of the price."
1,When you have kids that play with your phone you never know what can happen to your cell phone. I have no idea what happen or how it happen but when I went to take a picture or my kids I notice something on the picture so I clean my camera lens. I took another picture but the lines where still in every picture. I thought that I was going to have to replace my phone. But then I saw the back camera lens and purchased it. It's was very easy to switch the lens on the camera. Now I can take pictures of my kids with no lines on them. I received this item at a discount price in exchange for a honest review.
1,"Easy to install, perfect fit, I would recommend this screen saver for everyone."
1,"It's just a clip - but adds a Fish-Eye, Wide Angle, and a Macro lens for your creative needs. The clip has a long reach in case your camera lens is offset from the edge of your device. Each has an easy-to-remove lens cap and an icon to indicate the lens type. My favorite is the Fish-Eye lens, but the Macro lens allows you to take some very creative close-ups.<br /><br />The only problem I found is my HTC phone has two camera lenses. Not using both gives me an error message, but I can still take a picture. Get these lenses and let your creativity run wild!"
1,"For the price of this case, you can't go wrong.  If you own an ATIV windows phone you know phone case choices are slim to none, so I have tried them all, and this is hands down, one of the best.  It is durable, pretty, effective and inexpensive.  This is a win-win purchase."
1,When installed following instructions its prefect! Had one for 2 years not a single scratch.
1,"Like the material, however the Velcro straps are too short."
1,"Gook phone, looks beautiful, worth the price."
-1,"Glass shattered after 2 weeks, been trying to get a replacement for 6 weeks."
1,Came on time what i expected fair pricing said 39.99 on package well worth the 7.95
1,Rubber can get loose after a while and you'll just find yourself closing it again. May have to remove the iPod every now and then to clean the ipod and plastic of dust build up in corners that are difficult to get. Otherwise its good and provides good protection if paired with a screen protector.
1,"I'm in love with the case, it fits perfectly & really makes the phone look nice keeping the best parts of the aesthetics & adding new elements like the silver rim around the back completing the silver writing. Great job by Spigen."
1,All cables worked well with my set up. Speaker wire could've been a little bigger like 12 gauge instead of the provided 18&#34; gauge speaker wire
1,"Great battery that held a long charge. I was surprised how awesome this battery was given my previous experience with a battery order from a different company that turned out to be warped. I was wary but grateful this turned out to be a very good purchase decision. Definitely worth a reorder in the future, as needed."
1,"only down side is the position of the adjuster button on the backside hits the vent and opens the adjustable arms so that my phone is no longer tightly fitting.  This happens due to the heavy weight of my phone with it's case (samsung note 2).  I just have to keep an eye on it and be aware not to let it rest on the vent so it hits the button, kinda a pain, but other than that it's working great so far"
1,"The case is beautiful and well-crafted. The only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating from me is because I wish it covered a little more of the phone. It only covers the back and sides, but does not curve to cover the face of the phone. I will likely have to get another case that offers more protection for anything beyond the normal day-to-day activities. Overall, I love the quality of the case and how great it looks."
-1,"our of memory every single day, even though I have over 8gb in extra free space on the microsd card."
-1,"I have only had this product for a couple weeks now. I followed the directions and it installed easily, looked great and I was really please with it. However after only a week it had a small chip on the side and a deep scratch on it. I haven't dropped in and while it has been in my pocket for a short time with keys the hardness factor advertised on this says it is one step below diamond. A key should not easily scratch it. But to be safe I stopped carrying it with my keys.<br /><br />Now a few days later I see a crack in it. Now I didn't have my keys in my pocket, I keep a silicone case on the phone that overlap the front edge and I haven't dropped the phone at all in the past week so no idea while it is cracked.<br /><br />My wife has another brand of tempered glass covering on her iphone6+. It is a bigger phone than my regular iphone 6 and she throws it in her bag with all her keys and stuff and has no cracks or major scratches on hers after 6 months -- even with my 7yo dropping her phone all the time while playing games.<br /><br />very disappointed in this product. I don't expect it to last forever, but to only last for 2 weeks with light use is terrible."
1,definitely the best phone case i've ever purchased. it's really high quality and protects my phone really well. i've dropped my phone a lot in this case and it has stood up well to the impact. the colors are really vibrant and lovely!
-1,"Works as advertised, though I'm afraid that it might break the vent louvers unless I'm careful."
-1,I'm going to return it  it was awful
-1,Its horrible. The flap won't close and it make the phone awkwardly big.
1,We bought 2 of these cases for a trip to Bermuda.  They worked great.  Loved the colors and how well they worked.
1,Seller is fantastic; cable shipped is quite good quality and works absolutely fine. I recommend to others.
1,Braide cables are fabulous. I'm glad I found Anker products!!!!!!
1,These cases always meet or beat any Otterbox on the market I have owned several of both and am always much more pleased with my trident experience as they tend to hold up longer
1,"I think this has been certified by Apple, that's why it's unique. Really like it."
1,Fits the Note 5 Perfectly!!!
1,"Product arrived on time in perfect condition. The only issue is that it starts to get dirty after about two weeks, no matter how well you treat the case."
1,"i love this case because it's so cute! It fits my iPhone 6 Plus perfectly. I was aware it was plastic so it's a little slippery, but I love it so much! It actually got to me two weeks sooner which made me even more thrilled. I would recommend this to anyone who loves SAO too"
-1,All broken in 2 weeks
1,good
1,"it was my first selfie stick and Im happy with it, easy to use, easy to carry on my bag my phone fits perfectlyGreat"
1,My special needs daughter uses the stylys with her iPad and it's so nice to be able to replace the tip instead of the whole stylus.  They hold up very well.
1,I especially like that it will charge multiple phones more than once. It sure beats my old dinky thing that only gave me an extra 20%.
1,"Works well, I could not find this case when I searched for a case for the Note Edge, but seen a review and purchased it... the only case in my opinion. GREAT!!!!"
-1,"The cable didn't work. The charger itself worked, but the cable didn't."
-1,Disappointed! The pictures says sparkly bling case no I received a dull picture case it's not as described it ugly and I will not be ordering from u guys again
1,"I've tried other kits and this is the best I've used so far.  The tools are nicer than other kits I've purchased and the screen image looks as good as the original.  If you are attempting to do a iphone screen replacement yourself, make sure you get one that has the digitizer like this one.  Do NOT get one that is only the glass replacement. The digitizer is GLUED to the glass and you will need a heat gun to soften the glue to get the broken glass and even with that it is difficult. Get the digitizer like this one.  Highly recommend - you can do it yourself. Just don't do it when you are in a rush; make sure you a few hours set aside."
-1,When I first got the product I turned it on and it worked perfectly but it Doesn't keep a charge or pair with my phone
-1,Loved the case but it lost it's color within a week and a half so it looks cheap now
1,Awesome. My son loved it
-1,The quality wasn't good enough for me
-1,Cheap material. Less than 2 weeks it broke
-1,Garbage
1,Perfect fit!
1,It was ok
1,"Mostly I really like this product, but find I can't wear it as much as I would have liked because the ear pieces hurt my ears. It's not a problem for shorter periods, but when wearing for 45 minutes or longer, it becomes uncomfortable and then painful. If I don't wear them for a few days it's no problem wearing them again...but was hoping for something I could use on long bike rides and for longer runs.<br />It's a great idea...they're very light and sound is surprisingly good....but for my sensitive ears I'm afraid they weren't quite the answer. My daughter, who has borrowed them a few times...and now maybe forever, has not had the same ear problem I had...so maybe it's just my bad luck.<br />Just something to be aware of."
1,Quick delivery. Fits and works very well
0,Headphone jack not easily used
1,Clip is a little stiff so is hard to get off my pocket part time. Otherwise works great.
1,Great
1,"This is really good carpet.  Much thicker and more durable than expected.  Used it for vehicle interior restoration.  Works great for spray adhesive mounting to MDF panels, easy to work around complex shapes and the results are amazing (lots of attention at car shows).  If I need more, I am going straight to this stuff."
-1,broke 1st week !
1,"Nice sleek product nice fit , could have been better on bass - good for run/workout.overall worth the money spent"
1,"Works great, doesn't slip out of CD slot, and holds the firm securely. Only problem in the cars I've used it in makes it difficult to see radio channel and time."
1,Fast delivery and phone was as specified
1,Nice case .. Arrived way before it was suppose to which was good 😊
1,That awkward moment when it's the wrong their 😂😂😂
1,It's working properly as describe. I highly recommended this product to everyone.
-1,Not to size. Doesn't cut easily.
1,"Product covers entire surface of iPhone 6, cutout for the home button is very precise. This was not my first purchase from intelliarmor so I have had experience installing previous products. I was a little disappointed with the installation accessories, mostly because the cleaning film was flimsy and didn't take off 100% if the dust. I was able to use some of the installation accessories from the M9 screen protector I had installed right before. But the product itself once installed is perfect."
1,"Love it, best cover! I've had many spigen covers before and they do not disappoint!"
0,"after a while the battery doesnt stay charged for days, it stays chardged for longer time period than regular batteries though"
1,Good product
1,Good quality battery. Arrived on time.
1,"Very good looking case. The swivel belt clip is a real plus, but I'm not certain about its longevity. This is why I've given it a four star rating. It's fitted very well for the Moto E (second gen.) The presence of a very thin shell protector on the back of the phone results in difficulty when placing it in the case and removing it as well. I would recommend against using a shell protector if one is considering this carrying case for a purchase. I know because I tried to use one on my own Moto E and had these very problems.<br /><br />A thoughtful feature on this case is the metal covering over the lower edge of the belt clip. The faux leather covering over the steel spring always wears out first at that edge. This leaves the lower part of the clip exposed and the clip itself usually has sharp edges on it. This has always resulted in needing to replace a case even though the rest of it was still in good shape."
1,as expected.
1,these saved my day and product after i made the purchase - fast shipping and great quality
0,"Foam pads, meant to make a snug fit, fell off within first 10 days of use. Otherwise okay. Buy super glue at the same time you buy this."
0,I believe that this watch band was worth the price I paid but not much more. I feels good on however the fit and finish at the connections to the watch bezel leaves a little to be desired. It clearly has too wide a gap between the band and the watch and because of that it looks a bit cheap But not a deal breaker. Additionally it was very hard to get one end to slide on to the bezel. The other side slid on very smoothly.
1,"This case fits perfect and looks awesome but you definitely lose some wifi and data connectivity. I noticed it as a decrease in range, not so much in speed so it may not affect everyone."
1,It works great
1,It was for my daughter she loves it
1,"Great case, protects my phone very well.  True test was when I dropped my phone and nothing happened to my phone."
1,Good
1,This product is amazing. It is very protective and a very nice case!!
1,Great product
1,Really cheap and easy to install
1,"Worked perfectly, was delivered in a timely manner and the extra tools were appreciated."
-1,I've previously purchased head case design products and I have not been disappointed until I received this particular case. When I put it on the dimensions were off and it barely fit over my phone. I loved the design but did not meet up with my expectations.
1,I like it but the battery doest not last to much
1,"These are great screen protectors and you can't beat the price. I have been ordering these for the past 3 years for each of my mobile devices and they have protected them from scratching and every day wear and tear. The fact that it is glare proof also makes smudges less noticeable, which is always good! One thing to note however is that because it's glare proof there is an added layer, and it actually makes your screen slightly darker. You will also no longer be able to use your phone as a mirror, but you get what you ordered!"
-1,Nice if you would say that the socket us sold separately up front now I have to order one and wait two more weeks! Riduculous!
1,Awesome case
1,"Super cheap, replaced old one that lasted about three years.  Now using it as my off line music library.  Have a 32g card in it. :)  By the way, Galaxy S2 was still going strong.  Had to upgrade because Sprint said it would no longer support it."
1,Very nice product did what it said.
1,Wish there were more protectors in the package so when I can't seem to get it on right the first time I could try again... but it does its job... It seems that though when looking from the top and bottom the screen can still be seen so the 45° angle of privacy only works for the sides that doesn't give full privacy for me it seems there could be that tall person looking down at the phone that would be able to see what's going on if that makes sense... but other than that can't complain
1,Was a present for my fiancé. She is a ups driver and she won't take them off even after work so.... Yeah
0,"It's okay, but after one month, it's already a little loose and I have to continue to lift it up. Works for what I need and that's not having to hold it while I use Maps while driving."
1,"I love the beautiful design and look, also protects the phone well, also ordered a silver one."
1,Fits perfect should help keep the radio like new!
-1,Cord no longer worked after a few weeks without much use. It seems the wires got all messed up because the end that goes into the phone is loose.
1,"Worked perfectly, was delivered in a timely manner and the extra tools were appreciated."
1,great
0,Slow at charging feels cheep. But it works...
-1,"I've only had it in for two days, I haven't even dropped the phone and it's already cracked."
1,"Works great! Lost my good one that told me who was calling.  But, this one does a good job, easy to pair, easy to use."
1,works great
1,"This has been a lifesaver for me, as I carry it with me in my backpack all the time.  The only thing I would suggest to the company is to find a way to make the recharging time a little shorter.  It takes all night to charge this battery. It was an awesome buy though.  And having a flashlight with me has came in handy a couple  of times.  I would also suggest to anyone buying a external battery to buy a big one (min of 10,000 mAh) because even if you forget to charge it will last 4-5 times of charging a large cell phone battery."
-1,Wrong case
1,"Awsome case. My girlfriend loves it. It allows you to carry ids, credit cards, and cash without having to carry a purse."
0,Got this for Christmas 8 months ago and 2 of the 5 ports are no longer charging.  I am *very* dissappointed with this as I asked for this and was so happy with it until recently. I will be writing to Anker also about the issue. #dissatisfiedcustomer
-1,low quality cover
1,Really happy with the phone. Good price and arrived quickly.
1,Nice cover that fits good. Only drawback is that it does not cover the top and bottom sides.
1,EXCELLENT VALUE - easy to install and functions perfectly
-1,"Worked like a charm for a while but then stopped charging my phone, and have to connect and reconnect the charger to my phone and try and change the angle the I plug the cord in at to try and make sure it charges. No issues with other power cords I use. Should have paid more for higher quality."
0,"This was something I was looking forward to using, but I was not happy with how it felt. It has a slot for a credit card or ID and a flip open slot for another card or credit card. The slot holds my card in place securely, but I would prefer not having it exposed and someone noticing I have a credit card in my phone case. The flip top seems a bit weak and I do not feel like it is going to keep my card in its place. It has not opened up, but the magnet just does not seem strong enough. The design looks pretty on my phone and is sturdy and feels like it will protect it well. I would use it just for protection and not to secure my cards.  I purchased this at a discount, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions."
0,It's a great screen protector but a lot of dirt gathers where the edge of the screen ends.
1,"There's no question that Otterbox is superior, but the contrast between the medium and dark blue is awesome. It arrived very quickly and I am very satisfied."
1,Love it! Well made and I have the matching ipad case in pink!<br />Many compliments. I highly recommend it!
1,The best battery case hands down!
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
1,As advertised.
1,Very nice case - exceptional value
-1,Poor
1,"Bought it for my high school age student, he loves it."
1,"Nice product and price! Wish it came with just a few more small lanyards and less of the big ones. The small lanyards are made of a nicer, sportier, more attractive material. The large ones are flimsier and less attractive. But I am still giving this a high rating because the colors are nice, the quality is good, and the price was reasonable. I am using the big ones for my flash drives, and the 2 small ones I received will be for electronic devices."
-1,"Dead after 5 months, barely used. Can't get in touch with anyone about warranty."
-1,"Very Cheap and thin, wouldn't recommend"
1,"Best thin case there is. (4.5 stars)<br />I'm testing a few other cases and wraps for the Note 5 and this is truly a thin fit.  I'm not a case guy, I feel like you take away the beauty of a modern phone when you try to gussy it up, but also the slim slide and fit into your pocket is lost on most cases.  I'm looking at these because the Note 5 glass back is a finger oil magnet!<br />My feedback with percentages to ‘weigh’ the values of each:<br />Pros:<br />-Ultra thin and light, this plus glass protector, all I need if I'm doing a case (80%)<br />-Buttons don't have covers, this is fantastic.  Many cases have good ways to get access but they always loose some level of tactile native use.  Bravo (20%)<br />Cons:<br />-Not really a good 'bumper' case, as they've got split corners instead of re-enforced.  While this helps with my thin case desire, I don't think any common corner drops will help.  Time will tell (70%)<br />-The back is slightly greasy fingerprint prone.  Wish they would or will make a textured ultra-thin back (carbon fiber!) (25%)<br />-Spigen puts &#34;Auto Focus&#34; on the back of many/all cases.  I don't get it.  If they wanted a standard decorating companion to their logo, they could find much better I’m not marketing guy but contact me and we'll come up with a jazzy slogan like &#34;Just shoot it&#34; or &#34;Peep hole&#34; (5%)<br />I purposely didn't buff up the case to show the fingerprints, so this is why they lost half a star, but we all buff our phones a few times a day anyway, just wanted to show you.<br />I've bought 3 cases so far this is the one I'm using as primary.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
-1,Crap the paint peeled off in one day
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
1,"Makes a difference !, I own an iPhone 5s and it fits perfectly, came packaged with care. Well worth the money. I would highly recommend"
1,Came as expected and in a timely manner
1,Love it
1,Seems to be living up to its reputation but I have only had its month . I would recommend it to others
1,Works as described!
1,works very well for sailboat
1,Protects phone well but makes it very hard to hear people when they call.  They sent a replacement without me even asking and it works much better.  Great seller
1,"The seller was on top of things without even initiating communicating with them. Sellers such as those you appreciate when they check in after the purchase. In addition, selling a nice case (firm texture and tight fit) at such an affordable price, plus 2 day shipping? You can't ask for more."
1,bbbb
0,It works. Which is great. It has a sticker on it which was thrown on in the wrong spot. So I had to move it and you know if you move adhesive then it never sticks well again! And if you have more than one battery? Then you will basically never have it stick again. I took it off my battery when it was not sticking well as is anymore and now I have to hold it down and as I place my cover down... be veryyyy careful it does not slide off. You are trying to keep the left side part that is sticking out to stay in contact with at all times. It is a bit tricky to do. I tried to use tape but then it would not charge. So I had to take tape off.<br /><br />It is nice it is thin and does not require a new cover. Some require their own cover which is larger vs the one that comes with your own cell. And i found my Samsung s3 charges faster wirelessly vs the old way.
1,"For the price it is a bargain. Minus one star for the back clip slightly short and it would sometimes fall off the vent. I suppose it depends how your vent is shaped. Regardless, it does the job and good value."
1,2 amp fast charger. Love it
1,Clean and clear. Hard to believe it has a protector over the actual screen
1,"I love the case design, but definitely isn't the most protection. Granted I have dropped my phone a few times and it has lived without scratches or cracks lol"
1,Very pleased about the product
1,Very protective and cute!
1,I love this so much. It makes using my GPS on my phone so much easier. Also if I need to call someone I can put the call on speaker phone and this will hold my phone leaving my hands free to drive.
-1,does not stay on and is cheaply made
1,Excelent
1,We bought these to talk between vehicles during a recent out-of-state move.  They worked very well but we didn't get test the range beyond a mile or two.
1,Easy installation. Battery continues to work like the new garmin.
0,The bad thing is that it gets dirty so fast
1,"If you own an Android phone, buy this. These cords complete quality. The charging heads are very small, so it even fit my gigantic waterproof case.<br />YES, this has 2.1 Amp Charging. Many people who own an Android phone NEED THIS."
-1,Does not last long
-1,Impossible to perform a hard reset by myself. Had to send it back because it is impossible to remove the battery and no procedure for hard resetting otherwise.
1,"A tiny little device with a big impact!  The Lumo Lift was easy to set up with clear app instructions.  I find that the device works not only when I'm wearing it but also when I'm not--I have become more mindful of my posture at all times.  A healthy neutral posture is about more than just straightening up and performing a &#34;shoulders back,&#34; of course--and the Lumo Lift is designed to bring focus only to your upper body positioning.  However, it's an important place to start and I'm definitely digging the healthy feedback from the Lumo Lift.  You won't be disappointed.  (P.S.  Their customer service is terrific.  I had a question and received a response in ~ 24 hours.  Yay!)"
-1,Make the fire phone too heavy
1,I wanted an extra cord and charger for my phone. This product fits the bill.
0,"The phone holder was good, but the band was not"
1,"It's been awesome! Loved the case it came with, very happy with it."
1,I love this so much. It makes using my GPS on my phone so much easier. Also if I need to call someone I can put the call on speaker phone and this will hold my phone leaving my hands free to drive.
1,"I've been replacing all breaking cords withe these over time and I love them.<br />The quality of insulation is great and I'm sure they will stand the test of time.<br />And how convenient is this multi-length set!  I use the long one for my son's tablet in the car (he's in the back seat), the medium ones in the front seat or at my office desk, and the shortest stays with my travel/lipstick chargers for charging on the go.<br /><br />Not to mention that the company is great: They stand behind their products and are service oriented."
1,"Only one problem with idems, it is not a slide out clip on case it is very hard to take phone out of clip need two hands to take phone into your hands from clip on."
-1,Stopped working after a few months' use.
1,Looks and is as shown
-1,"Tried two of these and both were a poor fit.  Must use extra force to push it in and again to pull it out.  The issue with this is that the phone's female receptor does not have a infinite tolerance for being forced and if forced repeatedly over time, can break off its mount and actually get pushed into the phone.  Happened to my last Galaxy phone which I had to replace prematurely.  Not taking that risk again here."
1,A+
1,"I have only had this for a few days, but I love it.  It was the easiest screen protector to apply that I have had.  The screen is very clear and much easier to clean.  Even though I haven't tested out the protection quality (I haven't dropped my phone) I highly recommend this product!"
1,JUST BEAUTIFUL
1,Very nice product cancelled noise and good sound
1,Best phone case I've ever had
1,Great looking case! Allows the phone aesthetics to truly shine and the case fit perfectly. I feel like my phone is well protected from any possible drops. Would definitely recommend for those who want a non-bulky and durable case.
1,Wonderful product! Works well
-1,Don't like it.
1,"Worked good, just as described."
-1,Sucked
1,Color is so much cuter in person. Love it! Arrived 2 days ahead of schedule awesome! Edited I have owned this case for maybe 2 months already. My phone has fallen and all still no cracks or damages. I really love the way this case was built. I wish they had more cases to choose from. I love my owl case but sometimes I like to change the skins. Truly one of the best cases I have bought other than the otter box this has to be my favorite!  LOVE IT!!
1,It's just what I wanted...
1,It working good thank you very much
1,this is a great case for the money. It has a good design and fits well on my phone. It prevents any dust/dirt accumulation and is relatively water resistance. It provides protection without addidng significant size.  I give it 5 Stars. Additionally the ability to change colors of the case is a nice addition
0,To bulkie & it doesn't hold a charge very long (compared to the brand I have been using).
1,"The duration of the batery is excelent, eight days, i really like the pebble market, a great election cost-benefit"
1,It was a really helpful device
1,Exactly what my teenager needed to keep her iPhone from premature breakage.
1,Strong and attractive case. My only complaint is that the thickness of the case does nor allow me to insert certain headphone plugs
1,great case
1,"This case is sturdy and cute.  It is sometimes difficult to plug in certain audio receivers, but otherwise this case is a great fit!"
0,The size of battery is to small the phone doesnt charge
1,i like it!!
1,Love them and keeping them.
-1,The phone works OK but the microphone is terrible.  Anyone I talk with can't understand me until I go to speaker phone.  At that point it's real clear.  I would have sent it back but needed the phone for an up coming trip.  Will definitely be replacing it with another phone soon after the trip (which unfortunately is beyond my return date).
1,A great charging cable.  I'm order a couple more for a friend!
1,As advertised.
1,Great!!!
1,One of the best<br />But this time I was disappointed in<br />However healthier to buy
1,veryyyyyyyyyy nice case
0,There was mentioned in description that it's going with warranty. But the phone was sent without it and even without manual
1,"Delivered quick, works good, picks up a lot of sound according to the person on the other end. Easy to use but wish it had more options (higher volume and battery readout) but for the price it's well worth it."
1,"I was hopeful but dubious that this would perform as described.  I'd tried a few different headsets and all my calls said I sounded like I was in an echo chamber.  This headset is awesome.  It is small, light and comfortable and everyone I speak to says it is far better for on the other end.  The quality on my end is excellent also.  Syncing it with my phone was easy too.  I'm not a techno-whiz and I did it myself in about 5 minutes, after charging the headset as they say.<br /><br />I will give this more time, but will probably order a second one to keep in the car.  I love it."
1,"Great case , I love it.  It came way sooner than the expected delivery day.  And it fits my phone perfectly."
1,Works as advertised. Wish the older mounts matched this one so I didn't have to repair boat top rail
1,"I got this phone in an emergency, because my old phone died and I needed a basic replacement in a hurry before I got my new phone in the fall. I love this phone as a basic phone. This may be the best economical phone that there is! It's true, that this is very slow, but besides this phone being slow, it's pretty awesome! And, not all parts are slow, I'm able to text and unlock it with the speed of a very quick phone. I just can't play very many games on it. This ended up being great, because I'm vacationing in Nicaragua next month, so I've been trying to learn Spanish, and I've been using mainly Duolingo on this phone. And, it's awesome at Duolingo, and other lightweight applications. The GPS on this phone actually worked better than it does with all of my other phones, which was pretty awesome.<br /><br />I also like that it's small and easy to hold. Most phones are a little too big, and this one is perfect. It fits in my pocket without bulging. It's thin, but not too thin, too, so for me, it's a perfect size. It takes the giant SIM cards, so I had to get an extender so that my regular SIM card would fit, but it ended up working out great. I could have gone to T-Mobile to get a new SIM card, but they charge me for everything. And, it takes two SIM cards. There are a ton of features about what to use with what. So, you can use data only with one SIM and phone only with the other SIM, if you want. And, you can switch back and forth with an Android setting, if you want, too. I wasn't able to test this out, since I just have one SIM, but the interface looks cool. There's not much space on this, only about 1GB free when you start, so you'll need to watch the memory closely, and get an SD card where you push most of your stuff to. And, it's stuck on Android 4.2. There was one update, but it just updated it to another version of Android 4.2. Oh, and something else that i loved, is that it has a reboot option. With most Androids, you can't just reboot, so I love Blu for including this.<br /><br />I have to warn you again that it's slow. To get the most out of this phone, make sure that you don't have very much installed, and get a task killer to use before you need any kind of performance. But the slowness is all usually in between application switches, and with it doing things more slowly than other phones. This is basically like a Yaris with four big people in it, and 500 lbs in the trunk. It will go, but won't go up hills very fast. And, just like the Yaris, I love this phone!<br /><br />Overall, this is awesome. And, if you're okay with a slower phone, this would be a great phone. I used it for a month before i got my new Moto G, and now I'm going to keep it as a backup phone, or if a friend loses a phone. And, this would be an awesome phone for a child or a mom who keeps breaking or losing their phone. And, I'm a 43-year old man, and it was a great phone for me, too.cluding this.<br /><br />I have to warn you again that it's slow.

-1,"This is not a very good purchase it took over a month to get here. It makes it so you have a hard time hearing people as well as them hearing you, also we tested it without the phone in it for water proof and of coarse water pours in. Don't buy just a waste of time. Only good thing it was cheap."

1,This is a MUST for any Power User of Smartphones or tablets!
1,Awesome
1,"Great seller. Product was even better than I expected. Perfect for just grabbing the essentials when you're running errands. Very well made, and a great bargain."
1,"I love, love love it."
-1,Didn't fit the phone at all! This thing would up sitting on the table until I threw it away!
1,"I use my iPhone grocery shopping.  Instead of laying the phone down in the cart to free up my hands, having Loopy, I always have my phone on me.  Love it!"
1,"Fast shipping,  good pricing, and exactly what i needed."
1,Working excellent.
1,Awesome  product! Doesn't look bulky in the car...
1,I purchased this as a gift for my Husband. He loves how easy it is to use with his S5.
1,I love this case! It fits my phone perfectly and I love the bling! Also have to say that I rec'd my order very fast. I will order again in the future.
0,actually got it for a friend of mine that dropped her phone a lot and she said it works and looks great. cheaper alternative to less well protected cases
1,"Used this product on multiple cell units and all have performed well. Unfortunately, with the LG Flex 2 I am experiencing trouble keeping the shield intact near the ear speaker and the left edge of the face. I am very cautious to thoroughly clean the glass prior to mounting so I suspect the shield is simply too close to the edge and my protective case may be pushing against the edges. Regardless, the shield does an excellent job of buffering the daily barrage of jabs and pokes these cell units are subjected to. Will continue to use this product on my own and other family members cell phones..."

1,Love it...looks great...great protection for my phone!
1,That's good.
1,This is an awesome phone case. Very sturdy and well made.
1,"This is a good product at a great price! Four stars were given to this product by me for:<br />-It needs a longer low battery warning than just 2 min<br />-It cuts out every once in a while but doesn't bother me at all. Not even a 10th of a millisecond and continues the song, so not a big deal.<br />I am a very observant person so if it doesn't bother me than it most likely won't bother you if your aren't as observant. Other than those 2 things, this is a great product. I used the headset for talking on the phone once and the other individual on the other line could hear me great. Hope this review helps with your purchase, thanks!"
-1,It started to break only after a week that it arrived in the mail. Then it just kept breaking piece after piece.
-1,I didn't like this phone case at all.
1,"I've used a Samsung Galaxy S3 for two years.  Nightly charging to 100%, daily use.  Over time, the original battery slowly faded until the point that 9 hours of light use ran the battery from 100% down to 20%.  I bought & installed this new battery.  After charging it once, I thought it was just as bad (3 hours of heavy dropped from 100% to 50%).  After 2 more charges, the battery is much better (9 hours of light use from 100% to 62%).  I have much more freedom now, and am no longer so afraid to use my phone because of the battery.  Works well -- give the new battery a few days of charging before deciding if it's better or not.  Works great for me!"
1,These headphones changed my life. I recommended this to my professor.
1,Thank you
1,Works great so far.
1,works well for me

1,"[[ASIN:B00ZC8X8EU [Smart AI Rapid Charging Technology] RoyPow 5V 5.2A 26W Dual-Port USB Car Charger Cigarette Charger for Apple iPhone iPad, iPod, Samsung Galaxy Google Nexus 7, Fire Phone, White]] I purchased this usb  car charger at a discount in exchange of an unbiased review. I got this item on time and the packaging is well made. I found this car charger very useful. I use it a few times now in my car. The two port devices are really functional. Perfect because we have two iphones on the go. It's the right time to change my old one since my old usb car charger are getting tired of me, i've been using it for a very long time. Once you plug them in, the blue light will come out it means its working and ready to use. The deal I got for this product is all worth once this product will last for a long time. but I have a good feeling."
1,it is great as expected for a phone case.
1,Excellent! Worked great.
-1,It does not stays put. I attach it to the glass but it does not stays. The cellphone is well taken but the device itself does not remain attached to the glass.
1,great speakers for the money
-1,"Really disappointed in the stability of the swivel piece. Can't hold phone sideways, the only position that works is upright and straight ahead. Any kind of tilt and it flops over. Would not buy again."
0,"Be warned: you are not buying a &#34;new&#34; phone here. I bought mine from the seller named &#34;STEWART MARKETING&#34;. The phone was advertised as new, in sealed packaging. What I received was generic Nokia packaging with no mentioning of the actual device model (the box just says &#34;Nokia Mobile Device&#34; on it, and looks nothing like those nice boxes you see in YouTube &#34;unboxing&#34; videos for this phone). I then entered ##634# and saw the Lifetime counter at 1:50:34, meaning my device WAS ALREADY USED by someone else. I can see no scuffs or scratches as the other reviewer here, but the power supply I received with the phone is worn dirty, and the USB cord is covered with a messy white substance. All this makes me think it is a factory refurbished device (it looks like a factory refurb and not like a repackaged used unit), but what it certainly isn't is new.<br /><br />Also the listed specs are wrong for this phone; it does NOT support the many LTE bands advertised, and ONLY works at 3G speeds with AT&T SIM card.<br /><br />Now the device itself is another matter; it's nice and dandy. The Windows Phone 8.0 OS is just meh (can't even adjust brightness quickly without going into the app menu and settings), but the latest update should bring it to WP8.1, which is very nice and very usable."
-1,"This seemed to be a good idea, but the adhesive on the glass would not spread out to the full screen size, leaving a corner unstuck with a bubble under the whole corner clear to the edge.  Nothing I tried would fix this, so the screen saver is worthless.  I would not buy this one again."
-1,"Cable didnt last even 2 months, it just stop charging my phone"
1,This is a fantastic charger. We used it on a family camping trip to recharge several iPhones and it was amazing.
1,"If you're like me and take great care of your product, you will love this case. It's thin and minimal and adds some design but doesn't overtake the beauty of the phone. Not meant or made for someone who drops their phones all the time. I've had the same case for my iPhone 5s and now I love it even more on my iPhone 6."
-1,The case a little thick but good quality
1,I put this in my 2011 genesis coupe and it hits super hard not too much though still sounds clean. I highly recommend
-1,"It was supposed to be white lace, but instead it was just painted on."
-1,"You kind of get what you pay for with this product. It's cheap but the sound quality and volume is very low. It also gets scratchy very often if you move the AUX cord from its original position, and the entire product itself can be very flimsy.<br /><br />It still works, but i'd rather invest in a higher quality one."
1,I like the phone it is as good as any android I have used. I am currently researching how to use it's cloud features with Gmail back office apps due to the fact it does not handle things the same way the android phone does for those that use Gmail as a UC system.
1,This case is awesome!!! I absolutely love it!!! I even ordered a pink one.
-1,"Not sure why everybody rate it 5 stars. For me, this thing started to break after 2 months. First it's just one port not working. I was like &#34;OK, at least I still got 4 working ports&#34;. But then they just quit functioning one after another. Now I only got one working port after 3 months, and not sure when it will turn into a brick.<br /><br />Now after reading through all the negative reviews, it seems that this is definitely not some &#34;rare&#34; incident. It's pretty common that this thing will stop working after 3 months. I'm wondering why so many &#34;5 star&#34; ratings - this seems really suspicious. I can only guess there's some kind of &#34;Paid Review&#34; or &#34;Review Scam&#34; going on here. I hope Amazon could launch some investigation into this, to see why such piece of crap could get reviewed so high, out of no reason."
0,I bought two of these at the same time.  One still works great but the other one broke.  The suction cup melted to the plastic and will not suction to the window anymore.  I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem.
1,Excellent product.  The four charge slots performed flawlessly and fast.
1,"Great Update to my old phone, and at an unbelievable deal."
1,"This power bank is lightweight and easy to carry around as a backup, and is great insurance if your phone runs low on battery throughout the day. Of course, you do need to remember to take your phone's charging cord as well.<br /><br />I like the size, just a bit shorter and a bit wider than my iPhone 5, and about the same thickness. Another nice thing is that it comes with a velvet drawstring pouch to store and carry it in.<br /><br />I wish the battery life were a bit longer. It seems to be good for one or two full phone charges, then it needs to be recharged itself (by plugging into your computer). But that's a minor quibble."
0,Charger broke during the first week I had it
-1,"if you are looking for a great screen protector to help keep  damaging marks and accidents on your childs favorite Nabi Big Tab, then this product is NOT IT.  I have bought many different screen protectors for different applications and devices from a variety of manufacturers over the years. some were oaky, some were good, some were awesome. this one didn't make the list.<br />I researched the product before buying, to study up on the application, the durability, and the reviews. while this product makes sense in some on some devices because of the sizes and mediocre quality, this is in no way made for the protection on investment of my Nabi Big Tab. the application process just does not work for the 20&#34; inch screen size. 4  units came with my order and i gave up after the third attempt. the manufacturer should redesign a new material and process for large applications because working on anything bigger than a 10&#34; tablet just doesn't make sense for this material. the seller was a good choice as the shipping was fast, but this product just failed miserably."
1,It worked. I was able to connect the iPod adapter cable in my car to my Android phone.  Any audio from my phone is transmitted through my car's stereo system.
1,"Very well made and comfortable product . Love the longer arm strap, secret key holder and secret cash holder!!!"
1,"So far so good.  Am a heavy user of my smart phone and by lunch I am usually stuck to a power cord.  This battery is now lasting about a full day.  Update - After a couple weeks, I am still super happy.  This battery is a beast.  Love it.  Wish it were just a little bigger, but works so great for me."
1,Great!
0,The tabs would not come off and left glue on the covers.
1,nice for traveling
1,It works!!!!
-1,It doesn't fit in the event
1,I've bought so far 3 of these for my mom & they have lasted for quite a long time (considering she stuffs them with cards she needs) very nice material too! So I'd definitely recommend them.
0,Its ok. The kickstand broke after a week and I  broke a paper clip in half and fixed it with that. Cheap material.
1,2nd one I have bought! Love these :)
1,I bought this for my s4 and an otterbox commuter case for my husband 1 year ago. We both accidentally dropped our phones on the ground a few times. Now he's looking for a new case while mine still works perfectly and only has some scratches on the back.
1,"his was a gift for my grandson-I asked him if he liked them and he said &#34;Yes! &#34; And when you're talking about 8 year old boys, that's a good response!"
-1,Rather loose fitting
1,ordered a new battery for my samsung galaxy III phone and it came on time and works great.
-1,Bought it for my kid's iPhone.  It's cheap and ugly.  I'm not sure how long it will last.  The green part of the case doesn't seem very durable and it's a little ill fitting.
1,Very nice case
1,These fit as expected. Poof! I have my headphones back!
0,This case fit my phone well but trying to put my id and two cards made it almost impossible to keep closed.
-1,I broke my iPhone because of this case buy a speck or a tec 21

1,Perfect
1,"Unlike some other car stereos listed on Amazon, this one actually works, and works reasonably well. Once you get used to the buttons arrangement it's a breeze to operate. I would have preferred a unit wit a remote control but one can't have everything for a reasonable price these days. My only concern is that the unit was made in china and my experience with their goods is that they are largely kraap and have the lasting power of a tissue in a bonfire. We'll see. All of that notwithstanding, the volume is reasonable, the sound adequate, the radio sensitivity marginally acceptable and the ergonomics decent. I give this radio four stars because it didn't smoke out or detonate in 3 nanoseconds."
1,I love the look and feel of the Soga Bling cases.
-1,"I read the reviews before I purchased this case because I wanted to make sure that it'll protect my phone if I accidentally dropped it. I thought it looked really sturdy and well built based on the reviews, description and pictures but the whole case is made out of plastic. I was surprised by the material because I thought that the cover was going to be made out of rubber. The &#34;rubber&#34; part of the case feels like plastic. I got the silver case because it looked so nice on the pictures but mine already had some scratches and was a bit of a dull color. This case did not protect my phone from damages when it accidentally fell about 3 feet of the wooden floor and ended up breaking the screen. I paid for this product alongside a screen protector which I believe is from a different company and ended up wasting almost $40 and my time. I wish I just bought the otter box instead of being thrifty."
1,Love it I can work around the yard without carrying my iPod around<br />Sound is clear and you can even change songs with the push of a button on the headphones
1,Works great and got it fast
-1,is lousy need to stop the loading least two months in the sun to achieve load as need to connect your phone for 5 hours to achieve a 20 percent charge<br /><br />Es pésimo necesitas dejarlo cargando mínimo dos meses en el sol para que se logre cargar por completo mientras que tu teléfono necesitas conectarlo 5 horas para que se logre cargar un 20 por ciento
-1,Not pleased at all.
1,Better than I had hoped for.
1,works fine
1,Freaking love it! Not only is it super cute but real protection for my phone. Nice and sturdy as well for those occasions my 3.5 year old snags my phone.
1,"I instantly loved the look of these headphones! They’re very modern looking and different. I was looking for a lightweight, sleek alternative to getting my headphone cable yanked out anytime I caught it on something at the gym. These did the trick and they're incredibly comfortable. Sound quality isn’t generally high on my list of demands, especially since I have cats and can’t have nice things. But I was pleasantly surprised at how good these sounded on top of everything."
-1,"Every time I attempt to use the wall charger, a printed message on my Garmin Nuvi says &#34;The connected cable is not compatible with traffic for this device. Traffic service is disabled. Connect the correct power cable to receive traffic service.&#34;<br />I am not sure whether the device actually can charge the Garmin, since the Garmin is new, and the battery is currently fully charged. Gomadic/Amazon refunded my money, and Gomadic did not want me to return the charger. Everyone has been cooperative."
1,good
-1,Really Really Cheap quality misleading pictures  broke after 2 weeks and the battery was hell
1,"This works well with any smartphones, I have IOS and android and I don’t have any problem synching them with this receiver. It has Perfect audio transmission function no unnecessary noise whatsoever. It’s very convenient USB port for charging smartphones, GPS, and other devices working with USB charging.."
1,Great phone... I paid 700$ for the samsung S5 and since the start I never got reception anywhere....I could hear the caller but the caller couldnt hear me.. I went thru this for a whole year... Everyone said it was TMobile...  I told them I always had 2 tmobile and when I used to have many blackberry's I can hear them always... So I waited till the Leap came out and bought it and it works great.... Signal is great anywhere I am... No more problems with callers hearing me... The home screen sometimes freezes so I have to hit the button to black out and then hit it again to get back to the screen.... Always loved BB and will continue... And it was below half the price of the samsung S5 that never worked!
-1,Not very impressed. Wouldn't line up well and didn't stick for long.
-1,"I bought this cellphone, to save money on calls made in wifi, but nooooo,  my minutes were going  fast as I keep checking the balance with the tracfone widget, even calls to tracfone costumer service to fix my issue were not free eigther."
-1,"After two weeks, the speaker started making this continuous noise (like tornado warning sound).  DON'T buy!"
-1,Haven't tested the waterproof feature (don't want to) but the case does not snap on easily and the worst part about it is that the case has to come off completely in order to charge the phone. The opening meant for the charge port is not big enough for the charger. Shouldn't complain for as cheap as it was but it's basically useless.
0,Work okay.
1,Works as expected.
1,"Loved it, I just wish it had some kind of preservative on the wood. It fit nice and sleekly, and I got great compliments on it. The camera and controls were easy reachable and there was no interference. I would have given it 5 stars if it had the aforementioned stain or something on the wood."
0,The clip to release the phone from the holster can be a little difficult but overall works great.
1,Won't plug into iPod touch 5 while in otter box case

1,"These headphones are the best I have ever purchased and probably the most affordable. They sit so comfortably and there is no movement from the headphone. Yes, i swear they stay exactly how you put them in. The cord does not have that pulling motion that yanks the headphones out of the ear ear while your arms are pumping. The sound is great I am not a sound engineer, but there is a perfect blend in bass and treble. I love that I can adjust the volume from the ear piece and change songs. I love that it is Bluetooth. I now can take my phone and use Spotify for my runs and have my phone in my hydration pack instead of on my arm."
1,"Wonderful product, I would buy another one."
1,Fits great! Durable. I love it. Great price.
1,Good but bulky
1,Works great!  The little vibration instantly reminds me not to slouch.  Love it!! This is going to be my holiday gift for loved ones this year.  Soooooo cool!
0,Compare to other case I bought on iPhone....this case is not the best.....
1,"Love it, has done it's job and some!"
-1,I was thinking this was a protective case which would cover the entire phone. What I got is just a snap on cover for the back of my phone which does not offer any protection.
0,Not all of them are worth it but most of them are cute!
1,This thing was good just didn't work out for what I needed which was a phone mount on my boat. It couldn't handle the vibration at full speed. The suction held but the arm would flop down and finally snapped off. For a car this would be awesome.  Update- great service from seller on warranty!
1,Great case. Fits great. Awesome price.

1,"I purchased two of these to charge my new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, one for work and one for home<br /><br />PRO's : The unit is small, very stylish and looks good sitting on my nightstand.  When I place my phone on it it begins charging right away.  There are a lot of blue LED lights that blink while the phone is charging and stay solid when the phone is charged.  On my desk at work, I live this product.<br /><br />CON's : I wish there was a way to turn off the LED's and they can be very distracting at night.<br /><br />OTHER : While this unit does come with a USB cable, it does not include an AC plug in.  I discovered that if I use the quick charge AC plug that came with my phone with this charger, it works great but if I use a cheap non quick charger it charges very slow.  I ended up going to Frt's and spending $20.00 to get a AC 2.0 charger to plug this into.<br /><br />Also I don't know if its this charger of the Verus S6 Edge plus case I bought but the phone will not charge wireless with this charger and that case and I'm not sure if that is an issue with the output of this charger or the thickness of the case."
-1,"Already having problems with this cord. The last one I purchased lasted 2 years, which is why I felt confident ordering another. I'm getting the &#34;this accessory may not be supported&#34; message on my iPhone and I'm waking up with a phone that isn't charged...."
1,"I'm usually no good at installing screen protectors, but I have to hand it to Anker on devising quite an interesting procedure. They provide &#34;hinge&#34; stickers to attach to the protector and your device, which ensures the placement is spot-on. It also avoids picking up dust while you're attaching the protector. The protector is clear as crystal and there's no distortion like with some other types. I haven't dropped my device (knock on wood), so I can't say anything about how it behaves in that scenario. All in all, a good purchase, a good quality product, and worth the money spent!"
1,"Perfection, arrived quickly ahead of time, friends tell me (I can't see ur screen, is ur phone off) perfect!"
1,Perfect
1,"I bought it for the eventual EARTHQUAKE, when we lose power,  So far, it works very well (during testing...not an earthquake.)"
1,Works great with my 6 plus

1,"To  one  who's old enough to remember the absurd cost of overseas plug adaptors and the hefty size and weight of the old converters a few years ago,  this  tiny converter with its array of outlet adapters seems almost miraculous.  The converter is about 2&#34; square and can convert from 100 to 240 volts.  It has &#34;smart technology&#34; so that your devices charge rapidly and don't overcharge.<br /><br />Many people assume that (in this day of easy international travel) electricity would be standardized.  It probably should be, but it isn't.  Outlets in the US, the UK, the European Union, and in Australia all take different plugs.  Without the appropriate plug adapter, you might as well be staying someplace with no electricity.<br /><br />Also, US electronics run on 100-110 volts and outlets in other parts of the world supply 220-240 volts.  You MUST have a converter or you'll fry your phone. This converter has two USB ports.  It will handle phones and other electronics, but won't work for hairdryers, irons, etc.<br /><br />With this set, you simply choose the adapter that fits the outlet and attach it to the converter and plug it in.  The adapters even have nice &#34;pebbled&#34; sides, making them easy to insert and remove. That's a great feature, given the variety of outlet conditions you'll run into. You will probably never be carrying more than two adapters and the bag is roomy, so you can stick your cables in it.<br /><br />****** I was given a free sample of this product.  The seller offered nothing but a sample and asked for nothing but an honest opinion.****  My brother-in-law traveled to Germany this summer and the adapter/converters he used (loaners) were more expensive than this set and heavier, bulkier, and more difficult to use.  These are well-made and well-designed.  At the current price, they are a HUGE bargain.  Allow two weeks for delivery."
1,Product came in cracked so I tried using it anyway.. Finally just bought another one ..it seemed pretty good just didn't like the fact it was broke when I got it.
1,Very good product
1,"Fits well, but was hard to put on correctly. I enjoy the protection of the case."
1,Simple black case that fits really well. I think It makes the side buttons easier to press.
-1,"Based on my experience with another TomTom product (XL 340), I would not recommend anything from this company. The company is, in fact, sending me E-mails that border on spam because there is no unsubscription link in the E-mails (that I can find) and no way to delete the account without contacting customer service.<br /><br />Here is my experience with the XL 340<br />Unreliable and unmaintainable junk<br /><br />After I attempted to perform the last recommended map update, I got a flashing red X on the screen. In addition, TomTom Home said the device was not connected to the computer, even though Windows and File Manager recognized its presence.<br /><br />I do give TomTom technical support 5 stars for effort; the representative made every possible effort to recommend solutions . None of these worked, though, and neither did those posted online at TomTom.com. I was told that TomTom would give me a 20 percent discount if I purchased another; my response was that I was not going to reward poor quality by actually purchasing another product from that company. I just<br />bought a Garmin Nuvi 2555LMT as a replacement today.<br /><br />I was also told that, if the TomTom is old and the memory chip is &#34;worn out,&#34; it will not accept map updates, and will display the flashing red X on the screen. As far as I know, and I have some professional experience in the semiconductor industry, memory chips do not &#34;wear out&#34;--unless they are unreliable trash such as might be produced offshore under substandard conditions. In addition, the memory chip is not replaceable even though flash memory is relatively cheap nowadays; this means the product is not designed for maintainability either. That is, it does not meet the basic requirements of design for reliability and maintainability. (Does not constitute formal engineering advice, but this is more along the lines of common sense--e.g. the TomTom is similar to a light socket in which you cannot replace the bulb, or a flashlight in which you cannot replace the battery).<br /><br />As a result of the need to buy the same thing (GPS navigation device) twice because it didn't work right the first time, TomTom is permanently disqualified from selling me anything in the future."
-1,Just save your money and go ahead and order a real life proof case. On the first day the selector switch to turn the phone on vibrate stripped out. And the speaker on top doesn't line up with the hole that was made.
0,I have used this a lot on my Jeep and my RZR 1000.  I've had it in less than a year and a half in the Jeep and less than a year in the RZR.  I had a cable at the back firewall of my Jeep's engine compartment inside some of this loom.  Yesterday I grabbed that cable and the wire loom disintegrated in my hand.  Apparently it doesn't hold up too well in the heat.  I'm a little disappointed.  I expected better.
0,"Loved it , But the diamonds come off pretty easy and I don't put it on my phone often . So if you were to leave it on for a while most of your diamonds would probably fall 😕"
0,"There is a better product at the same price, It doesn't fit the screen very well."
1,It is the best one i have had
1,Works as advertised. Happy customer here.
1,Work as advertised
-1,"This case looks, feels, and fits great. However the first time I dropped my phone with this case from around 2ft, the case broke instantly. Would not recommend if you drop your phone often."
1,Excellent
0,Good case but images on the case are blurry and my charger cannot fit into the port on the phone while the case is on.
-1,Doesn't work. It does not charge my HTC cell phone. Had to get another cable. Not worth bothering to return.
1,I love this case.
1,I love these guys. They are great products at terrific prices.
0,I fully charged my kindle in about an hour from dead 0 and my sons says it works well with his samsung galaxy 5. My problem is that the part that goes into the lighter unscrews and mine came apart in my lighter and it was a bitch to get out. I don't trust using it again.
1,Wonderful case...convenient
1,Works just the way described! I got it to go tubing in Austin and I was able to take crystal clear photos in the tube. We were also able to listen to Pandora while floating!<br /><br />There are a few weaknesses in the product although it does not take away from my 5 star rating.<br /><br />-the screen can bubble causing you to not be able to clearly see the picture you are taking (although I didn't have this problem until the very end of the day and the final pictures still came out clear)<br /><br />-be careful not to tear the silicone screen with sharp fingernails. I inadvertently did this and I do not consider this to be a manufacturer's defect<br /><br />Overall I will be reordering for my next trip. Great price for the protection!!
-1,It's marvel comics not DC comics.
1,"Nice unit,  but I returned it and prefer the Mophie because it has a permanent on switch and a four level power meter."
-1,Hard to put on.
1,"Excellent product, very happy with it."
1,"Got me through a study abroad in Brazil and back.  It even served as a makeshift light for a hike back.  Durability nearly rivals the brick, and the double sim card is quite useful.  Never once used the headphones, just tossed them.  Good battery life, went days &#60;-- plural without a charge multiple times.  Obviously I didn't call much during those days, but it still worked, and kept me away from being a target for theft.  Definitely going to use it on my next long term trip.<br /><br />You have to delete the old texts though, and there's not a quick process for it.  Kind of a pain in the ass actually, because the texts just never reach you if your mailbox is full.  It's as if they weren't sent, so stay on top of that for sure."
1,Great product
1,Very comfortable and easy to use.
1,Love it! Well made! Easy to put on my phone. Great price!!
-1,"It broke after about 3 months of intermittent use. The plastic flange that held the suction cup to the base snapped off. Also, the head swivels too easily, even when the ring is tightened down."
1,very superior Case 5 Stars
0,Its alright
1,Actually really easy to install and protects the screen. Unfortunately it seemed to attract more dust during installation than others.
1,"It works surprisingly well. I spend a fair amount of time on conference calls. With this unit I'm heard clearly on calls, I can hear others clearly, and functions like mute are readily available. The fact that I can pop this in my backpack when I need to travel is a pleasant bonus. Frankly, I didn't think I'd ever do that until I tried it. I've taken this on quick trips to client locations etc where it continues to be a great little phone. Technically, it was easy to pair with my iPhone etc... I'd recommend it to others."
-1,"waste of money, 1 worked for about 5 minutes and the other 2 do not charge at all"
0,"The &#34;no annoying error messages&#34; claim is a load of crap. I got that error message the very first time I plugged this cord into my phone. And as you can see from the photo, the error message is on my iPad as well. Notice how the cord is plugged in, but there's no indicator that it's charging. A good 10 seconds after I took the photo, it did finally start to charge. When it is charging it does seem to charge at a decent rate. Time will tell whether it continues to work or not."
1,"Headset works perfectly for my needs. Sound quality is good. Earbuds fit comfortably in my ears, but do not always stay in place. I love the remote control/mic. I listen to audiobooks while I walk my dog and while I am doing laundry or housework, the remote makes it easy to pause/play or take a call without having to take my phone out of my bag. Also included was a nice little zipper case to store the headset in."
1,"This is my second one, and I liked the first one so well I bought another one when I tried to run my first one through washing machine. Price was good but the sound made it worth even more than I paid."
1,This cover saved my phone for over two years. I dropped it many times without a scratch.
1,worked just fine
1,Now when I'm out I don't have to look for a place to charge my phone is the best thing we came out with I love it so much
1,Nice feel.  Quality construction.  Strong magnet keeps inside case in place in the wallet.
1,Great
-1,"i am very disappointed. the connector does not even fit into my phone, so i have to force it in. when i take it out of my phone i have to wiggle it and pull on it hard, possibly damaging my phone in the process. definitely not worth my money."
1,Was very satisfied!!! Happy customer
1,nice product
1,excelente...
1,Great case for my iphone 6 plus.
-1,Doesn't work at all with Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. I've tried every position with and without the case. Useless.
1,"Easy to place, very clear, no problems yet, will buy again!"
1,Good alternative to LG tone pro
1,Thrilled with this!  No longer need a long cable to connect directly to modem!
1,This case has protected my phone from a few hard falls I love it. My only complaint an reason for 4 stars is the kick stand was very hard to open at first. I had to pry it open with a flathead screwdriver a few times to loosen it up.
1,"works great, thank you for the fast shipping"
1,this case is lovely on my phone i lost the pen though but it still works for me i would buy again in a different color the bling shows up nicely as well
1,good cell trac phone case thx deb
1,works great
1,"Very good quality and a rich look,  I have had people comment on the nice look of it.  Very happy!"
1,Is nice case
-1,Its a good case and has done a good job at protecting my phone. However i found over and over again that dirt and other particles can easily get behind the screen protector. I have to take it off and clean it at least twice a week. I work in landscape construction so for me this case isn't working out very well. My phone is either in the work truck or in my pocket. Its never just left laying around. Currently looking for a new case.
1,"These headphones are great. It easily syncs with your computer, phone, (or car if it has bluetooth capabilities). It comes with directions that are fairly straight forward and also comes with a charging cord, 3 sizes of ear rubbers (they come with the medium size on) and three sizes of ear rubbers so you can customize the headphones to best fit your ear. As for the bluetooth headphone quality, it is excellent. The sound is crisp and clear. However, the farther from the source you get, the worse the quality gets (as expected) so make sure to stay in the general area in order to have the best results.<br /><br />I attached a picture of what how the earphones go in because I felt like that part was confusing in the instructions. The rubber part that you see in the picture that is standing up goes in a crevasse in your outer ear. This rubber support helps keep the earphone in place and, since it is rubber, is not very noticeable.<br /><br />Overall, these are great headphones. I use them when I'm cleaning and they have been awesome. Very secure with the rubber support :)! Definitely would recommend these!<br /><br />*I received this product complimentary to test and give my honest review*"
1,Works great for my iPhone. What else can I say?
1,I love this case. It doesn't  make the phone appear much larger and looks great
1,Colors were very nice.
1,Fits perfect
1,great buy super fast shipping a+++
1,Good product!
1,Great
1,Got for my kid to use so I didn't have to listen to their you tube videos and games and horrible music and all other noises emanating from their ipads 24x7.  Manufacturer is awesome - and very responsive following a query on when the product would be available again.  The charges last a long time.  The extra cables and storage bag and everything else are a plus.  My kids love to dance around without wires and never adopted other wired headphones previously.  I totally recommend this product.
1,My wife loves these on her iPads.  She uses them for all three iPads she has.
1,"To start, This amp is beautiful. The illumination is my favorite. More importantly, this really pumps my 2 10&#34; kicker compvr subwoofers in my 350z. Awesome amp!!"
1,"Beautiful very high quality leather case that fits my iPad Mini 3 like a glove.  Love the antiqued brown color - a nice change from the black accessories that I always buy and easier to locate in my bag.  Case provides very good protection for the iPad Mini, along with a glass screen cover that I purchased.  Highly recommend this product."
1,Perfect for that charge on the go.
1,"Awesome phone stand.  Just what I was looking for.  Don't hesitate, buy it."
-1,Poor quality<br />Keeps disconnected<br />Does not stay connected to cigarette lighter
-1,Would not work in my 2013 Lincoln MKZ. The vent vains are to wide...
1,Just like the first one I had.  My son gave me a 2 in 1 that his employer used.  Kept looking for one like it but never found until now.  I can place them in different rooms and I always can find one when needed.
1,This is good
1,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this skin for a Zune HD, but it was nice to see that it installed easily, and had attractive bevels on the back which mimic the HD's case.  With this and a screen protector, the only thing exposed now is the single small button on the front.  The side button is pressed easily through the silicone sleeve.  For the price, this is a steal, and I may very well order another sleeve or two for future use."
1,I like it and it more comfortable
1,Liked it
-1,My daughter has only has this for a few weeks and the part of the case that holds the phone in place is completely breaking apart. I told her I would look into getting a replacement but it seems I'm a few days past the return policy. Wish I would have emailed them when the problem started which was almost immediately.
1,Feels like good quality. Works with my Galaxy S6 fast charger. I guess time will tell but so far so good.
-1,It works but the sound quality is incredibly poor.
1,This is a nice case and it looks nice in my phone. Thank You for another nice case!
0,goood
1,She loves it and its a great replacement for her old phone.
-1,It was below my expectation
1,Great when using my android as GPS in car.
-1,Broke within 2 months. Garbage
-1,I am giving these 2 stars because they aren't very versatile. The bar pins were too wide for a couple bands I had and one of the adapters broke while installing it and the middle button that snaps into place broke. I wouldn't recommend.
1,"I have trusted OtterBox for as long as I can remember; however, I have become addicted to LifeProof over this last six months. I guess I liked the clear case and slick look. Nonetheless, when I put this case on my Galaxy (work-phone), I remembered why I LOVE OtterBox. Not only is it fairly professional looking (it is a pretty basic, simple looking case), but it really is like encasing your phone in safety!<br />This case WILL hold up to a serious drop, it will (obviously) protect your phone from scratches and scuffs, and it will give it a pretty cool, polished look.<br /><br />LifeProof is PRICY. And, when I put this on, I realized that OtterBox is slightly better for everyday use than LifeProof (unless you are a devout hiker or outdoors person ... then, LifeProof might be the way to go).<br /><br />So highly recommended!"
1,"Not giving it 5 stars yet because I've only had it for a day.  However, as far as I can tell this case is great fits very well. All buttons and cut outs match the phone. I am able to charge the phone with the case on with no issues. Each corner of case has a slight ridge that prevents camera lens to touch surface. Great product so far."
1,"Perfect, thank you."
1,"great fit and comfort, battery life at 4.5 hours is a pain to charge often, and the interruption of signal can occur easily if iPhone or other device is not worn correctly, get a belt to hold the iPod on right side and there is limited issues"
1,"I've purchased two of these so far and both times they fit perfect and lasted longer than the original! Shipping was free and it came in two days! Very satisfied, I recommend this strongly if you're in need of a new charger port cover!"
1,Great replacement battery
1,Good
1,Works great
1,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
1,great case and service was also!!!
1,Good
1,"as described, fast smooth transaction Thanks"
-1,This unit returned. The signal strength at my home is not strong enough to overcome the cable loss from antenna to amplifier.  I think it would work fine if one had at least one bar on phone.  The unit was received in good contion and timely as promised by sellar.
1,"The Anket is very handy, especially when traveling . It is very useful."
1,"Amazing case, very very practical, it has good capacity, the magnet is working properly, and to an extent I'd say it is a water proof."
1,thanks
1,Very good
1,"Best earbuds I have ever bought, and I have owned some Beats and other name brands. Fits comfortably and really does knock out outside noise; I usually wear earbuds mowing the lawn, and often had to crank other buds up to overcome the lawnmower sound. With these, I can play at a normal level, which I suspect is better for my hearing, and mower is just a light buzz, at the most. Also have a Symphonized Bluetooth speaker, and would (wood?) definitely buy more of their products."
1,Thanks!!
-1,"the piece of junk arrived today. it flashed, popped and went off and on for several minutes. then it settled down with one led dead, one barely lit and 3 that randomly have convulsions of dim, off or super bright. This THING never worked properly or was even tested before you shipped it. I hope Amazon will drop your sorry ass as a pitiful vendor. WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO????????? as for those potential suckers who are considering ordering this thing I suggest you RUN AWAY AND NOT JUST WALK AWAY!!!!!!"
1,Great deal and saved me from paying for an insurance claim!
1,Very good etem I recommend I like a lot
1,"LOVE IT!! Wow! What a great bargain! This case is perfectly clear and nice and rubbery! It feels just like the much more expensive one that I purchased at the Apple store for my iPhone5 way back when. I love that the case covers the back of the phone, while keeping all the necessary slots open. However, it loses 1 star because the lightening adapter does not fit! (Womp womp womp). Other than that it's a great buy!"
1,Very good
1,"Read the reviews and ordered two of these 6'ers. I really wanted a 10', but it sounds as though the phone end of the plug is different on it than the 6' and would be too big to fit my Lifeproof case. That being said, everything has worked flawlessly on these two."
1,These are amazing! They have a good range and great bass. My only concern is that they tend to fall off the ear.
1,"Fits perfectly and looks better than the picture, love it!"
0,OK not as good as manufacturers band but workable.
-1,The cover is falling off from the side.
1,"Great price. It was clear for a few months but it started getting yellow, still worth it though."
1,"Ever since my first smartphone purchase several years ago, I've had a Speck case on my phone.  So, when I got a 5s a few months back I went with the Speck Candyshell. It fits my iPhone 5s perfectly and I haven't had any issues with using the volume buttons, or accessing the other ports, switches, etc.  It's not bulky, and protects my phone from drops.  The back of the case does show wear and scratches if you hold it in the light, but that doesn't bother me.  I'll definitely keep coming back to this brand!"
1,Bought it as a gift for my sister.  She loved it!
1,"I own 4 different LG models. They are all good, but this one is amazing. Great sound. GREAT sound."
1,Awesome tempered glass. Really protects your actual screen from damage
1,"good products, fast delivery"
-1,didn't fit the phone that I had bought it for. They advertised the wrong product.
1,"This case is awesome. My wife got upset with me and threw my phone across the parking lot, the phone bounced off the ground a few times and I thought for sure it was going to be broken...not a scratch or a cracked screen. I've had this case for about a year now, dropped the phone many times, still in perfect condition"
1,"Perfect solar charger for so many things.  Comes with the rechargeable battery which I could fully charge in about an hour in bright sun.  I've been experimenting with charging my cell phone and iPad.  I like that I can have backup when power is out.  This will definitely come in handy when we hike and camp.  Excellent packaging, easy to use and well built."
1,Adapter worked very well.
1,Works great
1,fits great looks even better
0,"It is good, but I would suggest the clear over matte version."
1,muy bien
-1,"When I first got this case, I loved it.  It came the way I wanted it, with the correct monogram, color, and font. However, after around 5 months of use it started to break; but I had dropped it a lot so this did not come as a surprise.  The back cover started to peel off.  I ordered another one to replace it and after about 1 week of use the same thing happened! I contacted the seller asking for my money back and I received a response saying that it had been too long.  Do not recommend!!!"
1,It's nice to have a built in screen protector and it fits in my pocket well. Only criticism is that to charge the phone you have to take the case apart because the connection doesn't fit well into the phone through the case opening
1,Perfect fit. Love it.
1,Perfect
1,Great case!! Sturdy and efficient!
1,long and nice color
-1,Bad screen I don't like it 😤
-1,Both of these cases did NOT fit the 5S at all.  While pretty and detailed these just did NOT work.  You can NOT get them to snap shut.
-1,Cracked within 2 weeks
1,Love it!
1,"I bought one and was very happy with it.  Then I bought a second one was pleased with that one, too.  I like the length and sturdiness of them."
1,I really love this case. looks really nice and protects my iphone.  had a cheap one that didn't do a good job and had a chip on the corner of my iphone. would order again.
1,Worked perfectly
1,Love it and it hasn't even come yet
-1,broke within a few days. trying to get refunded
-1,dont buy it waste of money
1,Happy with
-1,I've only had it for 5 days and the liquid has somehow leaked out. Not very pleased. I would like a refund or a replacement!!!
1,"excelent, very happy."
0,Was awesome for awhile but then corner started to peel
1,Very fast charging time.  No problems at all.
1,Very good case
0,Cables are a bit hard. I've taucht that they cold be a bit more flexible.
1,"Worked as advertised, very simple to use.  Worked for iPhone 4 so I'm not entirely sure if it works for anything else."
1,Got it quickly and it works great
0,Need better cases for this phone
1,This cable was just right for a new clutch purse/battery that I just bought. Will buy from this merchant again--should the need arise.
1,Good
1,nice
-1,Doesn't work well on Samsung Note 3.  Extreme wide angle is barely more wide than the built-in lens.  Focus is very poor also with lots of Astigmatism.  The normal wide angle lens is not much better.  Save your money.
1,"Very little to like or dislike referring to the product. I have used this phone for about two years and find it fine for my needs. However when I ordered it came from shopcelldeals and when the package arrived it was EMPTY!!! It took a good deal of writing, calling, arguing, cussing and waiting to get the product. I had a charge on my credit with an empty package. I finally was able to get in touch with shopcelldeals and they were able to give me the pin number for what I needed."
-1,This product doesn't work!! Don't waiste your money. They do not want to give me a refund. I asked for my money back two times.
1,great!
-1,Doesn't fit properly
1,The highs are so crisp 👌🏼
1,I like it. Works very well.
1,Works great for streaming
1,"Easy to apply,however, smudged too easily."
1,"My original Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman WT19i bought in 2011 was stolen, so I was ecstatic when I found this still on sale in 2014. Even if this one is fake, I'm still very happy that it's available for purchase, because I fall in love with this model back in 2011 and this phone is still quite enough for me even in 2015. The only problem is battery. It charges really fast, unrealistically fast I'd say. But runs down fast as well. Though maybe it's just me and other people might not have the same problem. Maybe it's not even a problem. My brother says that the original phone had this and I simply don't remember that. Anyway, the phone itself is great. Or was great back in his time. Its price justified its quality."
-1,"To bad Garmin didn't give this the quality of their other products. Have owned for 2 years now, rarely use it anymore. I have owned other training collars and have worked for over 6 years with dog/dog training. I bought this for a Vizsla/lab mix puppy(9months). After opening seemed to be of decent materials that Garmin is know for. Operation could be easier. All the setting modes function differently and I need to carry manual or study in some detail to remember what each mode is and does. Other models I have owned are far easier to use and functions/mode is labeled on the transmitter making it much easier. The bark mode doesn't work as well as other bark collars I have. No real adjustment and doesn't sense dog bark a lot of the time making it useless for this purpose. As mentioned by others, battery life is terrible and slow to charge both transmitter and receiver. Need to plan my use the night before and recharge both units. Forget about charging on the go or replacing batteries in the field as that is not possible with this unit. First time in the field I took my dog to the mountains. Dog jumped into the water as most dogs do. Never a problem with my past unit. This one never worked again. It never went underwater deeper than Garmin said it could handle. The hand transmitter is more waterproof than the receiver the dog wears. They sure need improvement with its &#34;water resistance&#34; as they call it. Garmin was good about sending me a new one as it was under warranty, but I can't let my dog go close to any water. Living in the 2nd driest state, there is still stream, rivers, ponds, and lakes near about everywhere I take my dog making this product un-useable. I would look for another Brand as Garmin was a big disappointment. Glad I bought a aftermarket extended warranty, as this was newly on the market, I'm sure going to need it."
1,Fdo
0,To hard to keep the dust out but it does protect the screen.
-1,I've only own it one week and it's de threading already.
-1,I have brought this phone from Amazon because my wife told me the site is trust worthy however on my arrival to barbados when I went to my local provider and did the necessary documents put the SIM card into the phone it have not work since I am so upset I have no clue what to do not good at all
1,This is a very colorful case that snaps easily onto your phone. The design is cute although the colors on the actual cover are not as vibrant as the image posted. It has a nice tactile finish. All the openings are perfectly accessible but I'm not sure how much protection this cover will really offer so it's really just for aesthetics. I received it for free from the manufacturer in return for a review but all of the opinions expressed are my own.
0,Nice looking. But dosent stick  completely around the edges. For the price it great.
0,"This fit the LG L3 well, snapping on in place of the battery cover and matching the phone's contour  The material has a good feel and is slides pretty well into and out of a pocket without collecting a bunch of lint.  This is quite slim, not bulky in the least but doesn't feel flimsy.  It's been on the phone for a few weeks and seems to be holding up well, but it is a little sloppy and when it is closed over the screen it slides around a little.  The part touching the screen is soft, so there has been no scratching.  The LG LG has no buttons along the edges, only on the back and this case has cutout for them so everything was accessible.<br /><br />I took this off the phone a few minutes ago and went back to a case that doesn't have a flip-over screen cover.  It turns out I find this moderately annoying.  The way I use the phone, it gets in the way and in a few instances it has made the phone more difficult to hold.<br /><br />I purchased this because I was unsure if I would like a cover of this nature.  The LG version was quite a bit more money and many others seemed bulky.  Other cases like this MAY wake up or sleep the phone when opening or closing, this one does not.  This is a very minor piece of why I removed it.  It does what it was designed to do, it just turns out I don't love it."
1,Going strong
1,As advertised.
1,Great case for the price. Doesn't add any bulkiness to the phone and has a nice grip.
-1,It was supposed to protect the phone. But after  a couple weeks the case broke.  No really strong.
1,"Beatifull, I love it!"
1,Excellent sound. Great price.
1,"liked the product, unfortunately I returned the phone for a different model"
-1,Extremely noisy. Zipper tabs rattle with every little bump. I have the iPhone 6 but this case is big enough for the plus.
1,The best
1,"Having purchased multiple mobile accessories over the years, it seems that a few of the brand offerings stand out as far as quality, price, and customer service. RAVPower is one of them, with products that work as advertised at an excellent price. I measured the output of both outlets and they deliver 2.0 amps. Typically one is used for my RAVPower External Battery Pack, and the other to charge my Note 3 phone. I keep this plugged in near my kitchen where people tend to congregate during gatherings... it's been very useful when someone gets a low battery. They're surprised at the speed at which this charges their device. The first question - &#34;Where did you get this?&#34;, followed by, &#34;How much did it cost you?&#34;. Usually within a week, they've got one of their own."
1,Very pretty I liked it very much came right away
1,"good protection of phone, what you see is what you get."
1,"I have an iPhone 6 Plus - I love this mount. It's VERY solid. Seems to stick well (tho I have not had it through a summer in Georgia yet) - I have it mounted in a Toyota 4-Runner on a plastic vertical surface. Extremely adjustable. Hardly shakes at all during movement (they're all going to shake some). I do not have a case on my phone - it grips it well and without damaging the phone. Has soft rubber-ish contact parts. When I set the phone into the mount, it automatically grabs it and can be removed with one hand. I highly recommend this mount. (Oh, in case you're wondering, the &#34;foot&#34; it rests on slides right and left, so you can position it where you can still plug in your power or headphones). I'm actually thinking of buying one for my office desk."
-1,DONT BUY.  VERY POORLY MADE. WORKED WELL AFTER 30 day WINDOW. WEAK. POOR RECEPTION.
-1,This case is sooo cheap. The &#34;logo&#34; was a sticker and instantly came off. After about two hours the cover came off of the while case.  This case is worth like a dollar or two.
1,Good
-1,Spend the money on a good set of buds....this would not be the set you want!
-1,"After 2 weeks, it failed. It looks very well made , so maybe I just happen to get a lemon. I will see"
-1,Is very dificul for in and out  of it.
1,"Arrived on time, fits perfect and looks nice but looks to be engineered for the look Rather than protect."
-1,the case does not close completely around my telephone.
1,It works perfect
0,It is a good case but I didn't really like it. For one the case is too big. Second I don't like the clip I thought it was cool when I saw it but it just look crazy on me and third the built in case you have to buy separately. Don't get me wrong it's a good case it will protect your phone but it's just not for me had to return it's to big.
1,PROMPT SHIPPING AND JUST AS DESCRIBED.
1,Heavy duty cord. Premium build. Excellent overall value
-1,This product worked well....for two months.  It became unchargable and progressively discharged even while on the charging stand.  I was able to get it to a 13% charge and did a reset .  Subsequently got a 70% charge only to get a very rapid discharge again prior to any use.  Trash.
0,"It's a great case all in all, but I don't like that you have to take the case off to use the volume off switch..."
0,"for the price they are great.  They stop working after a couple months, but I buy more.  With 3 kids I loose them usually before they stop working"
1,Works great!
1,"great super shield, keeps finger prints off and protects very well from scratches"
1,Gooood
1,"Great replacement head unit for your factory stereo. Connects Bluetooth to Apple and Android with the options of aux and USB inputs. Doesn't work with Windows mobile but its not a problem for me, just putting it out there. You can still connect to the aux port."
1,Tiny but great for the price . definitely worth the money
-1,"So i had very high hopes...its a great idea.  Magnets work well and are strong.  The metal disc is small enough to go in the case.<br /><br />Everything was there for my perfect phone holder...until the ball wouldnt stick to anything.  Dash, side, door, whatever.  No sticky.<br /><br />Now to find a holder for my holder...."
1,My daughter lives it and she is 6 and it protects it.
-1,Didn't last two weeks
1,"It fits perfectly, excellent purchase."
1,one of best all in one  would recoomend it<br />better than expensive brand
-1,"If you value your phone or the price you paid for it, this case WILL not protect it very well.  Pretty cheaply made and doesn't seem like it will stay in one piece for very long."
-1,"The case is very difficult to get off the phone and cause my phone to go flying out of it when I tried to remove the case, causing me to drop and break parts of my phone. Love the case but the lock for the lighter will not stay latched either"
1,"Super! Used it constantly for over a year now, it's traveled weekly and still kicking"
-1,Had to buy a new case. No one could hear me with my otter box on my phone.
1,"Awesome look! Hang these around your neck as long as your phone is near you never have to pick your phone up,  just push the button on the earphones. Clarity is crystal clear!"
1,"[[VIDEOID:57a84e2a3e8a6fd0ed22eb92157a6ddd]] I have a lot of 3- and 6-feet microUSB cables, but this is my only short cable.  And surprisingly, I use it more than the other cables now.  Having less length helps avoid tangles and enables for easy plugging.  In my video review, I show exactly how this cable looks and works.  For more details, see the video.  If this video was helpful, please click on 'yes' below.  Happy shopping!"
-1,I couldn't get mine to work
1,Very well made. Feels premium to the touch and texture. I would buy it again because of how well the craftsmanship is
-1,"This product is garbage. The first one I bought, lasted 2 months.  I thought maybe it was a random fluke.  So I bought another one. It lasted 7 days. 7 days! Both cords worked fine the day before. Then suddenly they wouldn't charge my iPhone or iPad. Don't waste your money."
1,"Product came as shown, good value for the price."
1,I was surprised how well these earbuds sound clarity is good and so is the bass.
1,thanks
1,can it push some 15 inch kickers?
1,Great value.  Case is completely waterproof and the profile is very slim considering it is a waterproof case.
0,"seems to slide out of the mounting bracket quite easily. Other than that, it works very well."
1,"These actually aren't too bad. I was wary due to the inexpensive price, but I got them to use with my Diver mp3 player since everyone said the headphones with that were awful (and they were). These work, but I wish that the ear pieces had different sizes- one of my ear canals is a bit different than the other.<br /><br />I found this out when I sucked it up and invested in higher-quality waterproof headphones (that cost about $70)....they had different sizes and shapes, and those definitely were a LOT more comfortable in my ears than these cheap ones. However, as I said, these cheap ones aren't awful and are a good starter set (especially if you are saving up to eventually invest in a better pair). I had them for a couple of months before upgrading, and they were still working just fine for me."
1,Product exactly as described/pictured. Great quality for the cost.
1,"Awesome product! I was looking for a way to keep all our tech stuff off my kitchen counter, this was it! It has been a lifesaver- keeps our items charged and in one spot!"
1,Perfect fit
1,Works perfect.... no complains.
0,First case for this phone. Seems to be doing the job
0,Good
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
1,Works fine
0,"This device is very basic. I would say it's ok for the price and the functionality is ok.Though sometimes after consecutive turns the GPS contact gets lost. The lane-assisstent could be better, especially if you don't know the route, you get confused sometimes because of unclear instructions. Mostly I like is, but one thing should be cured: The choices for the compere voices are poor and &#34;Samantha&#34; has a little sweet voice and absolutely annoying manner."
-1,Didn't work very well with my 2 10&#34; kicker subwoofers. Bass was not very clean and sounded muddy
1,Nice fitting case.  Provides plenty of protection to phone.
1,Good quality and super cute. Love taking my phone out in public with this case on.
-1,I ordered the Samsung galaxy s4 screen with digitizer the first one sent the screen wasn't working upon testing and it looks fake like a knock off so I asked for a replacement the second one is also defective it won't even turn on but when I put my old original screen my phone turns on . this is crazy .
1,Usb3.0 works great. Easy storage. Fits in messenger bag pocket.
1,muy bien
1,"I was a bit worried buying a capacitor from boss, as I know them to be slightly cheap. However I've had this cap for a few months now and its worked way better than expected! For the price you'll be hard pressed to find a better capacitor than this! And remember, you should have at least 1 farad for every 750watts to be safe, but having more than necessary is nothing but a good thing!"
1,Fits the Galaxy S5 phone perfectly and is beautiful.
1,"I am very happy with this purchase. the phone fits great (I have the regular, not the ballistic Turbo) and is secure, so it won't fall out. It feels well protected. I love the kickstand feature. my phone is my alarm clock so it is a nice bonus to have it sit up and hit the snooze that way. For the side buttons for power/volume, they work great. I actually think it is easier to use than the buttons without the case. And I have to love the price. If it isn't the best case out there, it is for sure the best value.<br /><br />The only con I can see is the plastic is a little cheaper grade than I would like. I am still confident in the case, but the plastic quality is lower than I would expect. There is a chance it may crack after a year or so. And if it does, this case is still a steal. but because of the plastic I gave it 4 instead of 5. But even if this case only last a year, I would buy this one again. And I may be just nitpicking and this case will outlive several years.<br /><br />If you got the turbo, this is your best value for a case here"
1,Product arrived on time and has surpassed expectations<br />I work outside and in the weather and it has been flawless
1,Fast delivery and great case!
1,Leather doesn't hold up well.
1,"Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend whose phone is constantly dying because he's on it so much. He has had it for about a week now and absolutely loves it. He no longer needs the lightning cable to charge his phone because the case also comes with a USB. He has also told me that he is able to get 3 full charges out of it without charging the cases when his phone is close to 10%. I would highly recommend this product, especially because he  is not technologically advanced in the least...and was able to figure out how to use the case in no time without the use of directions! :)"
0,Only needs a spot for license.
1,As advertised. Love the look and doesn't add any weight. Looks even better with one of their back cover skins.
1,Great case fit perfect
1,Love love love this case
1,nice
1,This case works very well! My daughter enjoyed taking underwater photos the day it arrived.
1,"Very interesting item. It took awhile for me to focus but once I did, it worked.  I purchased at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
1,Great Case at Great Value.. thank you SupCase :)
1,Worked as expected. Was necessary to adapt existing harness to the aftermarket speakers.
1,Good!
1,I have one and bought this for my husband works very well and is very clear works very well with Siri and iPhone 5c and iPhone 6.
1,It was ok
-1,"Stuck with the a voyager. This one un-paired a lot, not voice command for incoming calls, controls ar not well placed."
1,"FINALLY, a Qi charger that charges my Nexus 6 in its case. No fuss, no placement hassles of looking for the sweet spot. Put the phone on the stand and you're in business. (This was the fourth Qi charger I tried.)"
1,I loved this product so much that after a few months of using it in my own car I purchased one for my wife's car as well. The 2.4A charging port is super-fast and the extra port is a huge plus. I have had no issues with either of the 2 chargers I have purchased and would absolutely purchase from this seller again in the future.
1,"I received this product in exchange for a unbiased review, the shipping was fast and packaged securely the instructions were easy to follow and this screen protector fit my device perfectly. all ports and speakers work properly, fingerprints are easy to wipe off. i put on a case right afterwards and the screen protector didn’t  interfere made of durable materials and keeps my screen safe from damage. nice price for the durability and quantity"
-1,the cover does not close completely around my telphone.
1,Stuck the grip to my dash and now my radar detector is stuck to it!  Perfect for what I needed and works as intended.
1,Great value. Quick delivery.
1,All that it is advertised to be.  Plan to order more in a variety of colors.
-1,Not a realistic wallet substitute
1,So pretty.  Just enough bling.  Fits great and so far no one is saying they can't hear me while we're talking.
-1,"When it comes to electronics, I have always gone with this motto: &#34;The more you invest, the longer you'll have it.&#34; So naturally when buying earphones, I figured instead of buying the cheap $5 ones, I'll go ahead and spend a little bit more. I mean, I paid $25 for these and that is a little up there for earphones. Everyone I know buy the $10 ones from Walmart. This is the first time I have regretted following my motto. I ordered the black ones when it read &#34;still in stock,&#34; and then three weeks later they said they only had the silver/white ones and asked if they could just ship me those instead. I replied with &#34;Okay, I would rather have white earphones as opposed to none.&#34; They sent them to me and I received them the next week. The plastic baggie they came in had been opened, but they looked clean and unused so I gave them a try. Not even two months later, they are just dirty (they are dirt magnets) and the microphone doesn't even work. Further more, the &#34;noise-cancelling&#34; earbud set that comes with them are EXTREMELY uncomfortable and aren't even effective. My sister was on her side of the bedroom and she could hear my music even at the recommended volume. Remember when I said I didn't want to buy cheap $5 earphones earlier in this review? Well, like I said, I paid $25 for these and I received earphones with $5 quality anyway. I might as well have saved myself $20.00 and bought the cheap $5 earphones!!!"
0,"Hard to put on....well very hard to avoid dust. They didn't have an application video on their website so I winged it. Ended up buying the liquid one, not even using this one anymore. Very thick and bulky didn't expect such thickness. I like my screen protector to be flush. Even then the liquid version keeps bubbling with the case on don't know if either product is good or I just put it on wrong."
1,This is so comfortable with my cell phone when I watch a movie or just for daily use.
1,Always works great.
1,Works very well!! Much much cheaper and SAME quality as ones you pay for at the big retail cell phone stores!
-1,"Don't really care for this one, doesn't seem to endure the rigors of my everyday life; don't trust it to protect my phone if dropped or bounced around."
1,"Works well. Be careful about over tightened the screw as it can open the deck out especially on aftermarket decks where the deck may not be in perfectly with the car dashboard. Ball joint is perfect to get the right angle. Magnetic snap on and off is very convenient and much better than other phone holders I tried. Lets me have the phone in portrait and landscape mode, the placement of the phone in the middle of the car is great as well. I will definitely recommend to anyone."
1,"Awesome...very nice.  It took some smoothing it, but I'm but very carefulputting these things on. But this fits and is barely noticeable, and had no bubbles, it also seals completely around the edges. ..although I did need to smooth it out a bit. ..I'll post pics soon..."
0,Fixes my phone nicely
1,Keeps my family safe from a lot of storms in my area along with giving me a weather report! Have to keep it on the charger to ensure usage after storms.
-1,Charger can't be plugged all the way in or it will stop charging. Seems to be a bad connection in the foldable plug.
1,Everything was as advertised no problems installing worked just great
1,Great!
-1,"Cards cannot go in slot ,too small.  When phone is inside,  item will not close .  Material is good it is design that is problem.  Wireless charging still works."
1,Solution for dead phone
-1,"Was a great deal for the money...till 3 teeth broke. Now won't poem or close.  You DO get what you pay for, sadly. Won't be ordering another since this one was only a few months old."
0,"It would of been nice if it had ID slots on the left hand side for you to put your cards in . I bought  it thinking it had , but it didn't .  I like the magnetic closing ."
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
1,kit is eay to install
1,This unit is more powerful  than most others for its weight and size.  A great deal.
0,"Sadly, it broke on me already. I guess I snagged it too hard when I tried to remove it. Its a lovely color and I love the feel. But the quality for what I paid for was not all there."
1,Perfect for exercising. Surprisingly good sound.
1,Good item
0,Battery no holding a charge.
-1,Terrible. The &#34;carbon fiber&#34; chipped off the first day and looked terrible
-1,Doesn't look like the pic at all. But the case itself is good.
1,Works for what I need it for.  Wallet part could be a bit bigger.
1,Great case for the price!!!
1,I love it when it works. Finally switched to another brand after my second one broke. Love that it cannot be seen. Love that it fits in my ear nice and tight even when working out hard. The range and battery are pretty good. The down side is that it is much too delicate. Breaks at the seams where you twist it to turn it on and the top most seam where the volume button is. Great concept. Needs major work to get it right. Will buy again with improvements guaranteed.
1,"Pretty awesome little compact car mount.  I have an existing iOttie Easy One Touch that has served me well, but needed something more compact for a different car.  I have it mounted to the side of a bottom center console, facing inwards into a pocket at the base of the console.  It's a tight squeeze with the gear selector right in front of it, so I wanted it to be as flush as possible.  Was a bit afraid if I could still do &#34;fairly&#34; one-handed operation as I could easily do with my One Touch, so happy to say it works flawlessly!  The swivel feature is great also for times while parked and trying to view a landscape video, for example.  I'm using this with an iPhone 6 and slim case and it works fine.<br /><br />Thanks!"
-1,"Nice, love big cord. But ring around phone-end connector came out of cord housing within a week. It still works, but difficult to disconnect."
-1,"I've had this product since March. It did work fine until now. I never had enough time to post my updated feedback but, this charger will not stay inside my phone. If i charge my phone for the night, and if it &#34;oh so suddenly&#34; pops out while I'm sleeping my phone will be on 30% or something.  This problem has been occurring for the past month. I haven't contacted the seller yet, so I'll see how that goes."
-1,Not very reliable
1,"Excellent fit, holds my phone securely, backing doesn't allow sweat to get to my phone. Great range of adjustment possible (how-to is in their instructions) for very small to very large arms!<br /><br />Note that this is open-faced, so don't treat it as actually waterproof (the manufacturer is clear on this as well, so no complaint -- just pointing it out!)."
1,"This Athletik Sports Armband fits the iPhone 4, 5, and 6.  It is constructed of premium materials and has slip free flexibility.  Armbands are great when running, working around the house, working out, camping, biking, just any time that you want to keep up with your phone and don't have pockets and don't want to carry it around, constantly picking it up and putting it down and forgetting where you placed it.<br /><br />It has two additional pockets, the front one for your keys and the back one for card, cash, key cards, etc.  It has full touchscreen support, equipped with scratch resistance plastic cover to protect your smartphone while still making it very usable.  It also has top and bottom ports for earphones so that makes your activities more fun.  You can listen to your favorite music while you work.<br /><br />The Sports Armband by Athletik has all the features that you are looking for, and is adjustable for small arms to large ones.  It is made with quality Lycra and Velcro.  It's not going to slip and it gives you freedom.<br /><br />This armband is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  I like the feel of it.  It's not heavy, doesn't slip and it's easy to use, putting it on and taking it off.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and is based solely on my experience with the product."
1,Well made
0,"I like the case, but the cheap plastic cracked at the corners after only a week. You get what you pay for."
-1,Only one worked! It works great but I needed two not one!
0,"Shortly, after I purchased a Samsung Galaxy Tab A I managed to drop it and the screen broke. Naturally, I had not purchased the customer insurance that was offered by the reseller! I wanted some kind of inexpensive protective case and I wanted one fast. I settled on this one even after reading the reviews. The only thing that I can state negatively about this product is the description needs better editing. The one thing that others seem not to realize is that this product only cost $10.99. Anyone with a grasp of marketing knows that by the time the cost of goods plus the middlemen and the shipping costs are added up it's amazing that this product can exist at that price point. The product does what it says it will do and when you get past the Chinese syntax the description makes sense."
1,Tiny little screw drivers for those tiny little screws.
1,best cord I own hands down! I replaced my phone and ipod cord with this type of cord. long lasting too doesn't rip at top where most cords do
1,It was great and everything I expected... and arrived right on time.
1,Could not be happier. The repeater at Scout Camp was down and these antennas work so that we didn't need to fix the repeater the whole Camp session
-1,DOESNT WORK AT ALL! I ordered this for my iPod shuffle as the other cord is on its last leg - this wouldn't charge when plugged into the wall and wouldn't connect OR charge when plugged into my computer. DO NO PURCHASE THIS!
1,"Over the years I have owned many different blue tooth headsets.  This was, by far, the best I've ever owned.  When my H720 got lost, I was heartsick.  I tried 4 other brands, but none of them offered the comfort and overall performance of the H720.  I am back to buy another one, and wish I'd not wasted so much time and money on other brands.<br />I tried Plantronics, Jabra, and LG and my friends complained of &#34;background noise&#34; with all of them!  That NEVER happened with my H720.  So, I've finally wised up....a year or so and lots of wasted dollars later.  I recommend this headset to anyone!"
0,you get what you pay for on this one. Looks wise the case was great but the quality leaves something to be desired but then you get what you pay for
1,This STAND works great!!!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
1,"Amazing case - very clear, very slim, very protective. Excellent value, look and feel, quality."
1,Bought this really cute case for my 13 year old granddaughter. She loves it.
1,100% recomendado
1,Arrived earlier than expected! Easy to assemble and looks great!
1,Perfect case for the ultra. Can't beat it. Super thin and great price
1,Great product<br />Powerful flash light<br />Quick charger for iPhone<br />Very portable
0,"This was a nice case, just not as durable as we would have liked so we opted for an Otterbox."
-1,Ironically incompatible with 5c home button configuration
1,Worked as advertised
1,"This is an incredibly handy device. As a teenager that goes on many school trips, It's amazing to pass around the Audio cord and have the driver pop up anybody's music on the radio. Or if you simply don't have an AUX in on your car radio, this is your next best option!"
1,"This is an exceptional power bank. I'm impressed, and I want to help other consider a few things if they're thinking about making a purchase.<br /><br />Charging/Function: 5/5<br />-This charges my various devices quickly and efficiently. I plugged in both my phone and my kindle fire at the same time, and they charged with no problem. It's also great that there are two charging ports.<br />-The power bank keeps its charge for a long time.<br />-This came with almost a full charge out of the box (score!)<br />-It does take quite awhile to recharge the unit when it's empty/dead, so you'll want to plan ahead.<br /><br />Design/Convenience: 5/5<br />-This is a beautiful and clean looking unit that came in high quality protective packaging<br />-It's about the same size as my Samsung Galaxy S5, which makes it very convenient to stack these two in my purse to charge my phone while I'm out and about (see photo).<br />-I was worried that this would get hot, because it's all enclosed in plastic. No need to fear! My phone actually gets hotter than the power bank while it's charging.<br /><br />Bonus:<br />-My power bank came with easy to read directions and a link to join the company's VIP program, where new products can be purchased at a discount. I'm not sure how long this promotion will last, but it's a great bonus for an already smart purchase.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in order to test it and share my honest opinion, so I've tried to use this item extensively and address some potential questions and concerns here. I will update this review if my assessment of this product changes after a more prolonged period of use."
-1,Nice case but the belt clip broke in about a mont
0,"I've been using these cords now for the past week.  I've noticed a few things that I want to point out.  They are charging cables, and work great for that purpose.  However, it will not transfer data to/from the computer for the iPod.  Also, they do work as an attachment in my car to the stereo without issue...most of the time.  Sometimes I will get a message that says, &#34;error reading&#34;.  I then have to unplug the cord and plug it back in and it works fine.  If you truly just want a charger cord, this is the cord for you, especially for the price.<br /><br />I was provided a coupon for this item in exchange for a fair/unbiased review."
1,"The product was as described, it arrived very quickly, but many people I talk to you the phone can't hear me very well.  It is possible that the case somehow blocks the speaker slightly to cause this problem.  I am pleased as to the quality with that exception."
1,Really nice and usable. Thanks
1,Thank you
0,I can't really use this case for me it is too bulky.
1,As advertised.
1,Excellent product. ...
1,"Does the job, i.e. good protection, while remaining light and very thin. I just wish the material would let the color of the phone pass through some more."
-1,They were okay brought for my granddaughter she liked them
1,Love this adapter. Charges my phone really fast
0,"Glad it came in a 4 pack because 3 of them no longer charge my iPhone. Get what you pay for, I suppose."
1,"I have trusted OtterBox for as long as I can remember; however, I have become addicted to LifeProof over this last six months. I guess I liked the clear case and slick look. Nonetheless, when I put this case on my Galaxy (work-phone), I remembered why I LOVE OtterBox. Not only is it fairly professional looking (it is a pretty basic, simple looking case), but it really is like encasing your phone in safety!<br />This case WILL hold up to a serious drop, it will (obviously) protect your phone from scratches and scuffs, and it will give it a pretty cool, polished look.<br /><br />LifeProof is PRICY. And, when I put this on, I realized that OtterBox is slightly better for everyday use than LifeProof (unless you are a devout hiker or outdoors person ... then, LifeProof might be the way to go).<br /><br />So highly recommended!"
-1,"Bought these expecting them to last me at least a few months (couldn't argue with the price) but they lasted one day, with just using them at home.  The left headphone has already stopped working with under an hour of use.  Very unhappy with my purchase, I would not advise anyone to order these.  They seem to be built good and they appear to be durable, but no it is in fact the exact opposite."
1,Boyfriend loves it.
-1,"The charger is finicky when to work, and makes my phone act up while charging, the screen loses control."
1,"Upgraded from a G3 (not from Amazon, sorry - went to the local Blue Box store)<br /><br />It's a good phone - makes & receives phone calls extremely well - depending on signal strength.<br />  Camera is awesome<br />  You can add an SD card for additional storage<br />  You can change the battery (I recommend getting one from LG with the charger for it)<br />  Music sounds good<br /><br />Cons<br />  Seems to limited to Google browsing. I tried a couple others, including my favorite Firefox & they just seem to bog down.<br />  The leather back looks cool, but when I have it on, my soft case doesn't stay on very well. I drop things - need that baby buggy bumper.<br /><br />Big Con - What engineer decided to put the on/off button in the middle of the volume up/down buttons? Am I the only one who goes to raise the volume on a song & puts my phone to sleep?  Or, in the process of turning the phone &#34;on/off&#34; during a day, eventually turns the volume down so low, I miss the &#34;important&#34; call from my wife?<br /><br />Lately - trying to put the phone to sleep with the on/off button takes a screenshot ?????<br /><br />Come on LG - get some engineer who have to live with fat fingers like the rest of us."
1,"Update: Anker's stellar customer service contacted me and sent out another cable that has been working great for a week now! As a result, I've bumped up my review to 4 stars since I now have a working cable - but would've preferred to have a working cable to begin with (not a month later).<br /><br />I've been using it for only about a month or two, and the tip of the micro-usb side is already bent/broken, and doesn't work properly all the time anymore. Sometimes it's charging, other times it's not charging unless I fiddle with it.<br /><br />I'm very careful with my electronics, and have never done anything to cause excess strain on the cable - especially not bent or yanked the cable out in unnatural angles. I've bought many microusb cables, and some have frayed and whatnot - but I've never had one with such a cheap tip that bends off so easily."
1,"I have phone chargers all over the place. I keep a phone charger anywhere I know I'm going to be, and the same goes for hubby and the grand-kids."
1,As advertised.
1,Great.
1,Good
1,Still works after many years of use.  Not a top of the line product but it gets the job done and has provided years of good service (a little over 3 years so far)
1,"Great phone, has the old key board that I just love and larger screen.  Still need to get a little bit used to the new features, but this is almost necessary upgrade for bb users!"
1,Super
0,I told it was detachable as say in  the absolute website it wasnt shame ....
-1,"I would've rated this product 5 stars, because it looked great, fit well, and was pretty good quality. However, three weeks have gone by and the color has completely worn off on the outer bumper. It looks terrible. For this reason I am giving this case 1 star. This is a picture of the sea foam green case."
-1,The phone is crap can't even turn on when you first set it up. Don't know why they still sell it
1,"hard to beat for the price. won't work on all cars i.e. 2nd generation Dodge Dakotas and the air vent clips are a tad fragile, I've been using on in my 2014 RAM 1500 for 6 months with no problem and I have the iPhone 6+in a OTTER BOX."
1,Plug it in and once it is successfully connected it lights up.  No guess work.
1,meets my needs
1,Experience says this does a good job of protecting.
1,"I really liked the wire tool, i hadn't thought to use something like that before. The glass is plenty firm. Might help if it said which side of glass was front but it doesn't take much effort to flip it a second time without the glue/gel sticking to the glass... my bad on that part haha."
1,Very useful especial when I and my hubby need charge smartphones at the same time in the car
1,Good adapter
1,I love this so much. It makes using my GPS on my phone so much easier. I love how this one angles as to some of the other ones like it that are stiff. This makes it much better if you have a car that has your air vents at a slight angle. Also if I need to call someone I can put the call on speaker phone and this will hold my phone leaving my hands free to drive.
1,"Great purchase,  exactly as described"
1,Excellent Case.. my only idea would be to make the plastic screen cover insertable / removable. If you already have a screen saver on your phone the other screen saver does not play well with it. It creates what I call the bubble effect. I am not inclined to tear up either one to fix this problem.
-1,"Thought I'd use this adapter to switch between my iphone 5s and my Oneplus One device. Big problem since first of all this adapter has this little piece of adhesive on it which is not particularly strong. So once I inserted it properly onto the micro-sim tray slot for my Oneplus one, it first of all did not read the sim card at all. When I tried to eject it, the sim card tray ejected with the actual sim card (with a nasty scratch on it), but the sim card adapter was left stuck in the phone. I took it to a repair shop and they told me that my Oneplus device is now inoperable as a phone thanks to the sim card adapter basically shredding all of the sim-card reading pins on the Oneplus mainboard. So now I'm left with a phone that'd be too expensive to repair, an adapter that doesn't work, and needing to get a replacement sim.<br /><br />Lesson learned is, DO NOT use this sim card adapter if you have a Oneplus One phone. And considering the repair shop I took it to said that he's seen this happen many times for other people, I would avoid using adapters at all if you can."
1,Great love it my phone falls and it is great it doesn't even get a scratch
1,Works great<br />No issues
1,"Nice price. Shipping is high, but understandable in exchange."
1,"Edit: September 4, 2015  After receiving a glitchy cable that didn't work properly, I posted a one-star review (included below) detailing my problems and concerns with the cord. To my surprise, a representative from Anker emailed me the next day. She apologized and offered to replace it free of charge. The new cable was quickly delivered only a couple of days later, and to my surprise, it works as well as my official Apple Lightning to USB cables. Not only am I very happy with the new cable, I am even happier with Anker's prompt response in fixing the problem. After this experience, I would definitely order from them again. If there is an issue with their product's quality, they seem quick to fix the problem. Great customer service!  Original: August 30, 2015  After reading all the positive reviews, I had high expectations for this cable. Unfortunately, this cord or its connections are glitchy. Initially, it wouldn't charge or sync at all, but after some play, I finally got it to work. However, the cable will still only charge/sync when held up at a certain angle. If the cable is disturbed or falls out of the right &#34;place,&#34; it stops charging. You have to keep a constant eye on it. Yesterday, it took nearly a half a day to charge my iPhone because it kept quit charging at random."
1,Perfect for my daughter who is away at college.  Thanks so much!
1,I ordered these for my mother in law. They came very quick and she was very happy with them. Easy to apply and awesome quality!
-1,Feel like a cheap item and does work.
1,was good
0,"I put it on the first time and there was a few specks, so i decided to use the little lifter tape tabs to lift it up and get the specs out.  it ended up adding more specs, and if you try to get the air bubbles out, the protector gets scratched because by this point, you have the protective layer peeled off.  So I tried again, and by the third try there was more specs then ever.  Disappointing, but seems like it will last."
1,Best phone case I've ever come across. It's so durable biut lightweight. Extremely easy to handle. I'm very pleased with this phone case. I'm thinking about ordering more in different colors.
1,"Having purchased many 3rd party lightning cables in the past, I thought this cable would be the same. Most 3rd party cables don't work with both sides; they will only work with one side. However, this cable worked both ways and I was genuinely surprised. The charging speed matches that of the OEM cable and syncing works just as well.<br /><br />The build is really well built and looks almost identical to the OEM cable. The only difference I could find is the RAVPower logo on the cable. This cable is a bit shorter than the original cable but I find that actually works in my case because it reduces clutter on my desk. I recommend this cable to anyone who needs another spare cable, car cable, or if your OEM cable has broke. It is a lot cheaper than buying an original cable from apple and it works just as well if not better.<br /><br />Cable was provided for review by RAVPower"
1,"So I am pleased with the RAVPower products. I have a solar power panel, and large back up battery, and I have three of these car charges. I am all about RAVPower as much as I am with the Jackery's. None of them have failed me.<br /><br />Every now and then I do have an issue with it charging my Iphone 6 with an OtterBox resurgence, but the mild issues to not match up with the happiness I have with RVAPower. If you do not need more power or an ismart plug, then this is for you. As for me I have found that I need to have that extra juice."
0,"The device is size convenient but does not work as I expected, sometimes it fully charges my iPhone but sometimes it charges only like 45% of the battery"
1,Great product for a great price this is the best out there.
1,I would recommend this protector. I previously had another glass protector that did it's job and cracked when I dropped absorbing shock so my actual screen didn't crack. This one seems better than the first one I had.
1,The jambox is great. The sound is better than expected and the device is extremely easy to set up and use with my iPhone. I was however disappointed when I saw it advertised for much less from kohl's.
1,Great buy.
0,"The rubber coating on the case make it difficult to get the phone in and out of the holster. The stand on the case will only allow the phone to be propped up horizontally, not vertically. I have ordered a new case."
1,Just what I wanted.  Quality is Great.  Would buy again
1,Nice for the money
-1,This was clearly a magpul fake.. Had I known it was coming straight from China I would not have wasted my money
1,This thing is a must for a motorcycle!
1,"Great So Far. Snugg Fit, Stays Fit."
1,I love the privacy look.
1,"We have an older Sound Dock that has the old style iDevice connector. We had stopped using it because we didn't have any working devices that had that connector anymore. Luckily, I was able to find this Bluetooth adapter. It works well, has pretty decent range, and sounds good (a bit bass heavy, but very clear). My only complaint is that it seems that the only way to &#34;wake&#34; the adapter is to unplug it and plug it back in. That's a minor issue, though."
1,Love these cases. The durability is amazing.
-1,These were great but stopped working completely after one week of use.
1,Great case. Slick and protects  my phone.  Only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars is because if the air bubbles created in the back seethru side. None the less the best case ive purchased for the s6 (tried 4 already)
1,I ordered the stylus and was worried we would not have it in time before our children started school and wow we had it in 2-3 days. Very pleased.
-1,Cheaply made
1,I Will come back
0,The look is nice and sleek.  The feel is not as 'grippy' as I was expecting.
1,Excellent product
1,I like it
1,The  Anker charger  is the  BEST!  CHARGE  cell phone and ecig very Fast<br /> 4 electronic devices all the same time<br />Buy it!
1,"Being able to replace the tips on this vety good stylus extends the original investment in the stylus itself. Easy! Screw off okd tip, screw on new tip. Voila! New stylus"
1,"Great price, looked like it would be awesome protection in the water. Unfortunately it went missing before I was able to actually use the product 😥"
1,This was for my granddaughter's phone and she is very pleased. It fits perfectly
0,Don't want it... it was not what I thought it was. I will be returning it.
1,excelente
1,Great cases!!! Great quality!! Nice.
1,muy bien
0,"Got a great price &#60;$20, sound is about average, comparable to my LG Tone.  Mic is poor because it is in the earpiece.  You need to remove the earpiece and put it up to your mouth.  Because of the small size, they should be magnetic so as to not have them fall off and get lost."
-1,"I ordered this to replace my flex cable in my 5s after replacing the LCD and experiencing a re-boot loop problem.  I would disconnect the camera flex cable and the phone would boot up normally. So I ordered the replacement. Installed, the phone booted up fine. But when I would try to use the front facing camera the phone would freeze up and become very slow. Only showing a blur on the screen from the camera. So I pulled it back out and replaced it with the original. The original started working fine so I completed reassembly and left it alone. My phone works perfectly as it should.<br /><br />I did notice that the two cables are not identical. There is a piece of it that lays on the back of the LCD attached with adhesive like a sticker. The new one did not have this. It does not look the same but I gave it a shot anyways.<br />I didn't bother returning it, as I was glad that my phone was back to life. I toss it."
-1,very tight hard to get on and off
1,perfect
1,Worked exactly as advertised.
1,It's the first case to prevent my teenager from breaking her phone.  And she hasn't gone a year without breaking one prior to this case.
-1,Phone always gets hot sitting on the dash in the sun.
1,"I love my Ranboo I use it everyday when I go walking, shopping. It's just the right size for your everyday basic needs. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
1,Awesome price and quality
1,Great sound and beats my other cassette adapter. I like that the cord is stretchable instead of a straight cord because it takes up less space and doesn't get hooked up in things.
1,Works great!
1,Brought this phone for my daughter she loves it works great compact and cute pink color.
1,This case was great it is made with quality and definitely worth the price
1,Good case to use when i do not use my other more creative ones
0,This battery serves the purpose of powering the LG Env3.  The battery is a little bigger than the phone so it doesn't fit flush against the back.
-1,Very poor broke in 2 days
1,This is the best case I have ever had on my IPhone 6+.  It is good quality and durable. I love it
1,"I just love the selfie stick! used it for the first time yesterday during my son's baby shower,  and it worked wonderfully. I actually Set it  up and took good group pictures and elevated pictures was very very easy"
1,"This charging station has made my desk so organized. I highly recommend this product, it looks great and takes care of loose random wires while keeping my toys in one place."
-1,It works well but stopped providing charge after time. I want to say I received a few months out of it Max
-1,Does not work at all. I got this one and a different one and both wet my things inside. Thank goodness my phone did not get damaged.
1,"Love the case but as others commented earlier you have to modify the charger port access with a dremel. But its the only case i could find that had everything i wanted, mainly a screen protector, i an very satisfied with the case and will buy another if this one ever breaks. Oh yeah ive been using it for over a year now in very condition imaginable."
1,my fourth E980 phone. love. not a replacement i just have four.
1,No finger prints yah
1,"So far so good.. They were a bit tricky to get on correctly at first, but they really help with the iPhone earpods falling out. Could see myself having to replace them eventually because of the cheap, rubbery material it's made out of... But they're awesome right now!"
1,"It is capable of charging IPhones, iPads, Androids, GPS devices as well as cameras and this even works on my Windows phone.."
1,"Great product, dependable protection for your valuable electronics."
-1,All the cables are not working anymore. I want my money back. What a joke!
1,Fit my phone perfectly
-1,Didnt fit right
1,"I purchased and it cracked when I dropped phone Tech Armor sent out a replacement. No problems, I recommend their product and customer service folks. They sent a replacement glass, I was driving on my motorcycle today and my I phone 6 fell out of the holder at 60 mph. The phone landed on the the Tech Armor glass, it shattered, but it protected my phone. I removed the armor glass and the phone does not have a scratch. I would never expected this, but it worked. I am happy."
-1,I couldn't get it to fit the wire size and as I compared it to my other terminals I noticed the hole was much smaller. But once I took the insulation off I realized it wasn't. The opening is the same size. Unfortunately the idiots that made the insulation made the hole smaller than the actual terminal so you cannot put as large a wire in it as which are used to. I am sending these back.
-1,Slipped out of my hand not even 3 inches and broke on the desk. Not durable at all.
1,Love it and keeping it.
1,Is very good
1,"Works well to make sure I can charge my cellphone while at work. Definitely would recommend to a friend traveling or who is prone to use up their cell phone charge quickly. After the main work day ends (6 hours on my feet), I sit down for the desk part of my work; I'll plug this battery into my phone and recharge it to maximum while I type at the computer. This routine repeats for five days until the weekend, when I recharge the external battery.  I think it could last more days without a recharge but I like to be sure."
1,Love this case
-1,"I bought 3 of these cables, to have one for home, office and car.  Two of the 3 have stopped working, and are no longer able to charge my iphone.  They worked for a few months, then died.  There is no apparent damage on outside of the cable, so i don't think it is dead to abuse.  They just stop working from normal wear and tear after a few months."
1,A must have if you try and travel
1,"A great GPS with accurate maps, easy to read to display and loud speaker for good audible descriptions of what route or changes to make make to said route."
1,I love my case.....fast delivery as well
0,"One of my cables shorted out already, and it took them the longest to ship out my cables."
-1,Didn't work at all ? Never charged
1,"mouth guard was purchased for my grandson. he was very much impressed with it. the charger even though i haven't tested it yet, i feel will help me in my travels."
1,I love this case! Extremely durable and holds a lot!<br />PLEASE MAKE IN MORE COLORS
1,Another quality Anker product. I've used their stuff for a couple years and it is well-made and works great.
1,Excellent!!! The best cutter !!
0,Works well.  My only complaint is that it left marks on the backside of the phone.
1,"Good value. However some dirt etc can get in where the home button is, so I had to put a piece of clear tape over it. Looks kind of janky"
1,It works but I can never seem to get all the bubbles out no matter what I try. It's only a few. It works though. It's a great deal for the price.
-1,"I'm going to return this.  I tried many of the options - attaching to the vent, to the dash.  It stayed for a little while than usually when I made a turn - it would go flying across the car or drop under foot. Didn't stay on the dash - don't fit together well."
1,"Like the way it applied, wish it would reach the corners completely though"
1,"I love it! It arrived quickly, earlier than expected, fits perfect and no problems after one month of use."
-1,My item got canceled! So i wouldn't be able to make a review! Thanks
1,"Very much out of the way,and you can leave it in."
1,"Small, handy, and functional. Holds phone well in either orientation. I don't recommend for anything larger than an iPhone 6. Definitely too small for a Note or 6-Plus. I have no trouble with skin-type phone covers."
1,"excellent case, great price"
1,"Good for the price, decent sound. They are on my fishing boat.."
1,Easy to put on!
-1,Would not connect/sync with my phone or computer.  May have been a defective device.  Replacement is being sent today.  Hopefully this one will work.
1,A great deal for the price.  Same quality as the single stylus at the same price.
1,"I've only been using this device for a few days but I'm very pleased with it. It works perfectly on my Note 4 (with a qi receiver). It's very simple to use, basically just plug the adapter to device and then plug in to the wall. You don't have to figure out the sweet spot, just rest your phone on the charger. I highly recommend purchasing this AND it charges with my caseology phone case on.."
1,"The product is just awesome. Shipping and packing were good from the seller's side. The quality of the sound is amazing(perfect mids, lows and bass aswell), it sounds like a high quality branded earphones for the price it is offered. Taking phone calls is a breeze, the call quality through the earphones and the clarity of the microphone is pretty good. It shows the battery bar on IOS (did not try on android). It connects to my PC very well, the Bluetooth connection is strong on both PC and the iPhone. The buttons on the earphones are highly helpful to turn on, turn off, pairing, amswering calls or disconnecting calls, volume +, volume -, changing tracks .............. all of them work really good. I am very much satisfied with the product. CHEERS"
1,Great product!!!
1,I like it and works very well
1,I bought this for my moms phone and she loves it
-1,Not happy with case or company it came from. Case did not  cover phone for good coverage. And it took me 6 emails to get my refund back. Will not order again
-1,My phone won't work through the cover and it said it would. Some reviewers used the same phone and said it would. I don't get it but this worthless.
-1,"I plan to give this as a Christmas gift or hopefully to give away to someone who still owns a note 4, it is way too small for galaxy note 5"
1,nice versatility however not quick to use
1,Perfect and cane really fast
1,Excellent case! Really helps on battery life for my iPhone.
-1,Cute but scratches easily
1,"Love it! It's soft so it doesn't scratch or damage my watch, plus it hides most of the cord inside the bowl. Would definitely recommend this product."
-1,"It fits the little nokia phone looks colorful and everything else but the rubber is more like some sort of hard flexy plastic more so then a silicone or rubber shock absorbing case like I am used to with other cases.  It's cheap for a reason, I still use it on my work phone, but its more of a pain in the butt then anything else really and the buttons are super stiff and hard to push to make them activate the phone buttons on the side when in the case."
1,"After reading other reviews I didn't want to invest my 7.00, but thought I would take a chance, I liked the brown leather look. But to my surprise I really like it, will buy again if need be. So far I have no complaints really glad I bought it."
1,"Arrived & packaged as expected.  A co-worker suggested I check out OtterBox, and it is a good product.  I'm satisfied."
1,Thank you
-1,had to return it because you cant get the app on ITunes any more.
1,Works great
-1,"Bought this phone last year, received the wrong item (Black - Boost Mobile version), never did send it back, although I was disappointed."
-1,Is good but does not last long..
1,"Excellent product, fits perfectly and the price is right. It came on exactly the date it was expected"
1,Great
1,"I was skeptical when I ordered this, but I found that it was easy to assemble and works well.  The magnet for the nfc switch works well and  the lenses that are included worked fine for me.  The phone is held in place by a rubber band and its held very securely.  The head band holds it into place nicely without being to tight for my average size head.  This is a nice way to try out VR and this technology will only get better, my kids were amazed at how they could look all around and interact with things in some programs.  There are many programs to chose from in the google play store and apple store to try.  I recommend it."
1,Works great! I love this phone holder.<br />This phone holder will securely fasten into your car vent.<br />I have a iPhone 5s with case and It fits perfectly!<br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
0,"Not too impressed, but not bad either."
1,Great item....beautiful! Thank you!
1,"This is the second time I've used this product from this company. I have fixed a 5s and a 5c, and both have come out flawless. I've watched a couple of YouTube videos from iFixit and they have helped incredibly. The glass is very high quality and there have been no imperfections on the screen display. I recommend this product to anyone trying to save a few bucks, if you don't mind doing it yourself. The only thing I recommend is to be careful with the fingerprint scanner on the 5s, if you open the phone to quickly and rip the cable your fingerprint scanner will never work again. Just be patient and follow the steps for a successful installation."
1,"LG Leon  Premium Phone Leather Pouch Carrying Case with Belt Clip holsters, I love it and will be ordering more"
1,Love the case! Quick shipping.
1,WORKING PERFECT SO FAR
1,Good tough case just scratches easily
-1,Stopped working after 3 weeks. not worth it!
1,"Works great so far, not good to charge while trying to sleep because of the blue light flashing."
1,The radio scanner works very well and I am enjoying it. The only draw back is the Battery life is a little short it only last about 4-5 hours other devices  similar  in  nature last about 8-10 hours. I am a retired Firefighter with 55 years experience and I like to listen to what is going on with my old friends and co workers.
1,good product
-1,Too loose for iphone 5s
1,"The item as promised, very fast shipping...a great case for the money...Just what I was looking for...Great price..."
-1,pin pictured is not the correct pen.  It did not work on my device.  I had one like photoed and it worked.
1,Great product.  Only way to protect your smartphones screen.  This item fit my LG G4 perfectly.
1,"So far, no problems."
1,Love it
1,I received this and was very excited about having the wireless charger but when I received it I charged it up and I have 2 HTC and Motorola phones I tried both of the HTC and it would not charge them and neither the motto.  I was very upset.  The description of the phones that it would work on was the HTC and this is why I wanted it.  It will not charge either one of mine. I took this to work and a coworker tried and this is a great little charger if it is compatible with your phone.  make sure you read the fine print to make sure it will work..So i have changed my original rating and she is very happy.
1,"It's a great case for the money!  To help other consumers, the color is more coral than pink and the case itself is a little slippery (for lack of a better explanation).  Never that less, I am very satisfied."
1,Great product
1,fit perfectly and a good value
-1,This sucks I hated it. This product isn't waterproof lucky i didn't put my phone in water...
1,Excellent quality... extremely happy with purchase
1,Looks great with the sport!!!
-1,"Doesnt play audio by Bluetooth or jack.<br />Tried on several cars, nothing seemed to work.<br />All that works is the usb, no audio through usb either."
1,"arrived on time,  fits perfect."
1,"I tried my Galaxy S4 in partial sun (cloudy) today. Started at 91%. Went out to check it 20 minutes later and was at 100%. I was happy about that. The reason I only gave it 4 stars, is Amazon and the companies advertising on Amazon shows 2.4 amps output for each USB port, but the manual that came with it reads 2.1 amps output for each port. I specifically purchased this unit for the higher capacity current capability.<br />Can XDragon chime in on this?<br /><br />I will be glad to receive my USB Detector to test it in full sun."
1,Great protective case but the screen protector was a little difficult to install.
1,As i rated it it's ok only thing i hate about it compared to my samsung galaxy s3 i had is that it don't have much led notifications it only appears to have red and green  and i use skype so now if left on i dont get  a notification  color since its usually blue for skype when someone messages me i can only see someone left me a message  when i turn screen on so this really sucks along with other apps too. but  other then that its ok.
1,Good sturdy case.  Fit like a glove!
1,Perfect...it fits snug around my phone and does a great job protecting it...the little kickstand is an added bonus.  Worth the money...would purchase it again.<br />Thanks!
1,"This device performs well, however sometimes during a call the audio is not crystal clear, I am aware that this could be caused by factors external to the device like cell phone signal strength. The multifunction buttons are always a problem for me. I would prefer a button for each function"
0,"This comes with a life time warranty and I had to replace it once. Velcro tears and comes loose.i bought two more because my phone wouldn't fit in any other carrier. Just expected it to be more durable, but for the price it is ok."
1,I have ordered 2x and it's perfect for front pocket phone carriers and when It goes in My purse nothing sticks to the screen it's well covered.  I'm prone to drop my phones and I don't worry with this case. Although I prefer the black. I ordered green which was available that day..
1,"Item as described, delivered in a timely manner."

1,Good glass amazing deal I love it
1,Great protective case. It scratches a bit easily but I didn't get it for the looks.
1,The product is excellent for my phone.
-1,It kinda didnt work after a few weeks and i got really sad but it works only if you place it a certain way...
-1,I should have read the other reviews more carefully. This is one of the Spigen cases that scratches the frame. I only had my phone in the case for 4 days and when I removed it the the top and sides of the metal frame were scratched. There is nothing I can really do about it at this point so I just returned the case and bought something else. I don't know how this case is still allowed to be sold after so many complaints.
1,Ok.
1,Excellent  value. Very durable and attractive.
1,I ordered it because I needed one to replace the one I had & it worked.
1,Got it yesterday & think it's pretty good
-1,Hi purchase one and had to return it because one of the headset when out I got the replacement when using my cell phone the sound goes in and out not too happy with this product
1,"Honestly, for the price I paid and how simple it is to use, I love it. I received this item very early, it gave me an estimate of September 9-28 and I got it August 29th. I have an LG G Stylo phone and the stand holds it up perfectly. I will purchase from this seller again."
1,great price and works great
1,Good!
1,"I was a little concerned because it came wrapped in plastic but not in an original box, but it does appear to be an original Samsung battery and works as well as the one I received with my phone.  The only difference in the labeling on the battery between this and my original is the country of origin. (Yes, that made me wonder, but like I said, the one I received does work as well as the one that came with my Galaxy).  I do not use NFC for anything, so I cannot confirm whether that aspect works or not."
1,"If you are going to buy this for your ttc amaze please don't buy it. But otherwise you can purchase it. I put this battery into my HTC amaze and then it just started giving problems. However, the seller is good, they communicated well with me and help me solve the issue. Thanks"
1,So when watchOS2 comes out this fall it will enable nightstand mode for your Apple Watch. This stand is ready for that because to use it you lay your phone sideways. I love the design of this and I am so happy its nightstand mode ready as I do not have a bedside clock.<br /><br />The stand is made out of a matte rubber and its very flexible. Its actually 2 pieces as well. You have the base which you wrap your cord around and then you have the top part which acts as a tray. Once your cord is wrapped you push your charger pod into the area designed for it then push the tray over top of it. This not only helps support the phone but hides all the excess wire.<br /><br />I have plenty of docks due to testing and reviewing but this is my daily used dock because of the design. I also love the color. If you aren't fancy on the teal they offer other options!<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes.
1,Came in perfect condition but only thing is the double case doesn't fit exactly with eachother
-1,"After using this cable for less than 10 months, the cable stopped charging my iPod, so I have to carry an extra cable to charge the iPod. What a bummer! The remaining three plugs are still working."
1,Pretty good value for money
-1,Return item
1,"Very pretty, like the card holders.  Happy with purchase."
1,"The wife picked it out and loves it!  So I'm happy. 'If the Queen is not happy, there is no peace in the kingdom.'  Very sturdy, protects the phone well, and looks great!"
1,Easy
-1,"Breaks too easily,will never buy again. Looks cool but old drop and the wood stripes away in long chips"
1,It's great love it!!!!
1,"Wonderful to use within U. S., esp. for overseas travellers.<br />The setup to use data is somewhat difficult, but after it is setup properly, you have data access within U. So."
1,Cables are pretty thick. Bigger than Apple sync cables. So far strong and durable quality. Got a 3 pack for a great price.
1,Great
1,"I lost my Jawbone after only two wearings. I was so upset that I came home and wrote to the company.<br />I was amazed how quickly they responded  to my email.<br />Jawbone then followed up with numerous emails in order to send me a replacement Jawbone!!<br />I received my new Jawbone within 10 days of losing the first one due to the band clasp coming apart.<br />I have been using the clip on Jawbone daily.<br />I am an ice skater, primarily an ice dancer with a lot of footwork involved.<br />Im not sure how accurate the Jawbone is, but I will continue to use this to monitor my exercise.<br />Have you had other inquire about the accuracy of its use with ice skating?"
1,Good quality phone case.
1,LOVE THAT MY PHONE LOOKS LIKE THE ORIGINAL AND THE COVER IS LIGHT WEIGHT.  MAKES HOLDING THE PHONE COMFORTABLE.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN 'STYLE'
-1,Order this case for my daughter's iphone 4. It's about a inch to big. In the discription of the it clearly says it's for a iphone 4.
1,"The cord included originally did not work. It did work with my own cord, but I emailed the company and they responded the same day and sent out a new cord. Now I can use the battery and it is awesome! So useful."
1,"Works perfectly, and though its a bit tough to get on, when its on you know it won't slip around or get out of shape.  Have not actually put it too the test by dropping the phone, but I feel confident it will work and the extra rubber corners seem very effective.  The pen does not offer any value to me and I would have been just as happy if it was not in the package, but there's nothing wrong with it."
-1,The fabric was too stretchy and the cards kept falling out of holder. I only kept it on my phone for a little longer than a week. I don't recommend this product.
-1,I purchased this charger to take with me on vacation recently and it failed me completely.  After using this product less than three times it just stopped working completely.
1,Very happy with this case and the service. Exactly what I was looking for and description was accurate. Arrived on time.
1,Updating my review.  I received the 2nd device from the company and it has been working great.  When charging by the sun it charges fast.  The first one must have been defective.  Thank you for making it right Just what I wanted and expected. Good product for the $$$. Changing review due to company reaching out and sending another to make it right.  I will try it to make sure it doesn't quit after a few month. I do have to give kudos to company and their customer service. Worked great the first couple of months.  Now it won't charge anything.  The little light fell into the box after the 1st week. Was a good idea but cheaply made.
1,Great
1,Good for the price. Sounds decent. A little uncomfortable . U got get use of it.
-1,"Broke within a couple weeks, was replaced, new one broke again within a couple weeks. Not worth the money"
1,Daughter loves it
1,Worked for my Google Tablet (2013) version.  Guys at best buy wanted $200 to fix the usb port but this pad allowed me to charge the tablet and cost so much less.  Thanks.
1,"After I watched a couple YouTube videos, I was able to figure it out.  Works great..  I saved the tools for when I have to replace the screen."
-1,Did not look like the photo. I sent it back
1,Good
1,"OK. . So after trying 3 other protective covers, this is the only one which fits the Note 4 precisely. The holes in the  cover line up with the ports on the phone. It doesn't add any weight to the phone. This cover has enough 'lip' around the sreen to protect it when posed face down on a smooth surface. It is sturdy and thick enough to protect the phone when it drops to the floor. I am totally happy with this protection time cover"
1,"Nice looking case, it seems to have the essentials for protection against ballistic mishaps. I have yet to test its actual effectiveness (and I hope I never do)."
1,Works great!
1,Great amp especially for the price says 1200 birth sheet says 1345 and I can sure tell
-1,Horrible quality! It came open in the sides.<br />I wouldn't purchase again.
1,This item was exactly as described.  Price was best I could find.  Shipping was quicker than expected.
1,nice
1,"It works great.  I shake it to check how much charge is left.  It is able to fast charge my phone when I use a quality cable. The cable that came with this battery is not good and won't fast charge the phone. You probably already have a cable that will work with this battery. Also, it looks really good."
0,The product is a bit misleading... it works okay.
-1,"Hello,I bay so many things from Amazon and I never had problem until now,I revive my Samsung 6 edge yesterday but my camera is not working proper,can not focus.<br />I read  so many reviews but I can t fix the problem,do I have to replace the phone or I m missing some ting so I can fix issue by my self .<br />Thank you."
1,Great product fits good<br />Thank you!
1,"these do what they are supposed to.  I liked their older product with the clipping leash better, but they aren't making them any more.  So far, okay for what it does!"
1,Love the cover but wish picture was clearer as it is a blurred pic.
1,"I love my Misfit. I wear it every day and usually sleep with it on. I get compliments on it because it looks more like jewelry than a fitness tracker, which was my purpose for choosing it! I knew i would be more likely to wear it if it was cute rather than chunky and ugly, especially being in a corporate office all day. It works great, and I've only had to replace the battery once, which was in line with companies claims of battery life."
1,"Had for over a year.  Yesterday on I-94 in Detroit I was doing about 80 miles per hour and a bug feel on my phone.  I held the phone up to see if the wind would blow it off and the wind caught my phone with so much force that it went flying out the window at 80 miles per hour on the freeway.  My phone was not damaged but he case was a little scraped.  My wife told my in-laws that I usually pay a lot of money for a good case to protect me phone so she's not surprised.  :)<br /><br />I can't believe my screen wasn't cracked or anything after this thing bounced off the pavement or even another car at 80 MPH.  Attached are the photos.<br /><br />The screen got a little damaged, and Seido was great about replacing it.  I tested it in water and it didn't get any water in it.  Only complaint I had is that people have a hard time hearing me on speaker phone with the case on - so I have to hold my phone to my head or use a Bluetooth headset."
-1,"This is not fit my phone, the screen was completely warped and had a chip in it ."
1,"The case is of good quality, the screen saver was not, but I didn't need one anyway."
1,"Amazing cellphone and incredible price!! SImple, fast and confortable, the right balance..."
1,My only complaint is people who call me say they can't hear me well.
-1,No good
1,Factory new  again.
1,Great case! I have had it on my phone for several months now and I have had no problems. It still looks the same as the day I bought it. Very cool and sleek design. The buttons are easy to press though they don't give that &#34;click&#34; as they do without the case. It has helped my phone survive many drops from chest height. I have had no problems with speech or sound being blocked by the case and no problems with accessories fitting such as headphones or chargers. I would recommend this case to anyone with this phone.
1,Great for the price
1,Great phone case! Love the designed! Have received so many compliments!!  Fast shipping and great price!!
1,great price i have had this before but not at this good a value
1,Super cute... Loving it!
1,This case is amazing! It has everything they said it would and works perfectly. The tempered glass is really easy to put on and even has a kit to clean your phone before you put it on.<br />The only thing I didnt like was that I was thinking that it came with a camera hood but I even stuck my finger through were the camera is and still nothing to enhance your photos. But other than that the case is flawless
1,"Having tested one of BLU's earlier (Studio) cellphone models, I was curious to see how this new model fared. I can honestly say that this phone does not disappoint.<br /><br />Unlike the previous BLU model I tested, the Energy X model has a very solid feel to it. Part of that seems to be due to an improved case that uses a higher grade of plastic. Part is due to a heavier, longer-lasting 4,000 mAh internal battery. Combine that with an even larger 5.5&#34; screen and you have all the ingredients for a phone that looks, feels and operates far beyond any expectations one should have for a cellphone that sells for well under $200.<br /><br />On the plus side, this model's expansive 5.5&#34; display is bright, crisp and very highly responsive. It's quad core processor gives it more than enough juice to stream both audio and video. Resolution-wise, you will not get the same quality picture as an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, but it is quite adequate for viewing the usual content you would normally be watching on a 5.5&#34; screen.<br /><br />The phone's battery performance is great on standby, but drains a bit faster than other phones I have used when running applications. I suspect that the phone's ultra-bright, oversized screen is the main culprit when it comes to battery drain. Fortunately, the phone's internal battery charges up to 4,000 mAh, so you can go longer without recharging than with most phones. The phone's plain-vanilla Android OS is a joy to set up as compared to most phones. You will not find any of the bloatware common to phones you will get directly from your carrier, or even direct from most manufacturers like Samsung. No features are blocked or locked, that includes the ability to tether or operate your phone as a  portable wi-fi hotspot.<br /><br />With all that said, there are obviously some shortcomings with a phone this inexpensive. These mostly fall under the category of &#34;frills&#34; as far as I am concerned, but they may be more important to you. The most obvious shortcoming of this phone is its camera. If you want to record HD video or take high-resolution pictures, this is definitely not the phone for you. It's 8 MP front-facing camera operates slowly and produces sub-par pictures as compared to most modern smartphones. So, don't get your hopes up when it comes to taking pictures.<br /><br />The second most obvious shortcoming is the phone's memory, or lack thereof. 8GB of internal memory and 1GB of RAM don't go a long way if you run a lot of memory intensive apps on your phone. You can add up to 64GB of memory using a micro SD card, but SD cards operate at slower speeds than RAM, so choose your apps (and where you store them) carefully. If you do add a micro SD card for extra memory, be sure to buy a Class 10 card. They may run you a few dollars more, but they seem to run much faster and more reliable than the cheaper Class 4 cards.<br /><br />Another oddball &#34;feature&#34; is the phone's use of removable &#34;cartridges&#34; to store both the micro SD card and the SIM (actually, SIMS, since it holds up to two SIM cards). The phone comes with a tiny &#34;key&#34; you need to use to insert or remove the memory or SIM. You could just as easily use a paperclip, but the fact that these tiny cartridges could become so easily lost or broken while swapping memory or SIM cards is a bit worrisome. If you are the type of person who almost never accesses the SIM or SD card, this should not be an issue. If you swap these frequently, I would stay away from this model though.<br /><br />The last downside I will mention is the phone's battery. While it has great battery life, the inability to swap batteries or quick-charge is a bit of a disappointment. I think that BLU went the wrong direction in making the battery non-swappable, but I'm guessing that accounts for how they kept the price of the phone so low.<br /><br />Altogether, this is an impressive looking phone with an easy to read screen, tons of features and plenty of battery life. While it does not measure up to an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy when it comes to specs, what you do get for the price is pretty awesome. With an unlocked GSM smartphone with dual SIMS, quad core processor and 5.5&#34; display for under $200 you can hardly go wrong.nd plenty of battery life.

1,"My 6Plus was left on the roof of my truck, it well off, was run over at least twice, and this case saved it! Love It! had it for about a year, never with out my business cards. Incredible."
1,"What a great little device. Puts out plenty of current and is stylish and easy to carry. I'm hoping the battery quality stays high for a very long time, which is why I chose this brand."
1,"I bought this QI charger for my HTC, I was a little worried about the overheat problem, and used it for one week and the result turns out great, the overheat problem do not exist."
1,So far good and reliable
1,Very pleased with this product. Practically installed itself without any bubbles.  The feel is natural without loss of touch sensitivity.  Will be searching for this product for other installations.
1,"I bought this for my hubby's birthday. He recently purchased a Subaru WRX STI, and I figured the $70 would be a lot better spent on a radar detector than on speeding tickets lol! It works fantastically after he got it positioned properly on his dash, and is easy to read and  hear. Once you get used to it, you don't even have to look at the detector anymore, because you can determine what alert it is by the sound out the beeps"
1,It is a good quality protector and fits perfectly on iPhone plus.<br />Price is affordable as well.  I will buy it again.
1,"After a short-lived MPOW, I tried this device.  So far, so good.  The sound is clear and the device is easy to control.  I also like how the ear piece turns in on this vs out on the MPOW.  The battery life is not as good as advertized or as good as the much bigger battery area would suggest, but I get enough time to drive to work, lunch, drive home and a little time in the evening so good enough for me.  The main drawback in my mind is the microphone boom.  While it's nice that it is small and can be folded back, why can't these guys make one that is just for listening without all that speaker nonsense.  I'd really rather be (or at least look like) an audio-only device."
1,"As advertised, protect the phone well. Strange construction, not a knockoff."
-1,cheap but you get what you paid for! Basically was just a filler to get up to where I could get free ship.
0,"As others had mentioned, the suction cup REALLY SUCKS! (In a good way, of course!) It holds on tight! My problem, however, is that the screw-cap thingy that attaches the camera to the suction cup holder has cracked. That means I can no longer tighten the camera in place. Just that one little piece...and there's really no way to order another piece. :-(  I am planning to try duct tape or electrical tape to see if I can get it stabilized, but otherwise, I'd have to purchase a whole new camera just because of the one piece cracking. Bummer."
1,"costly, but you get what you pay for. Excellent"
1,Great sound quality and comfy.  Also has a good battery life. I would Def recommend to anyone.
0,It covers the phone but the kickstand broke on the first day!!. Couldnt bother with the return.
1,Fixed the ground hum when connecting an ACC100 FM radio transmitter to a mixer. Simple solution to a nightmare problem.
-1,Fit great. But the design wore out fast. Had to replace after a few weeks.
0,"Battery was a little better than the one I had, but not much"
1,Love love love my jackery!!!!
1,Great replacement battery
-1,Not impressed. Braided part already starting to fray.
-1,worked for less than 5 minutes. JUNK** do not waste your money on this.
1,This an amazing case! Best iPhone case out there. You can't beat the price and this case is much better then another life proof case because this case actually works I just love it!!!
0,Works good. Does not hold charge for as long as it should. Great for the price point.
-1,"DO NOT BUY.<br />I'll try to be short.<br />Was biking, had phone and key in arm band.<br />Velcro is terrible, comes loose while biking.<br />Key falls somewhere in the woods.<br />Samsung falls and front facing camera breaks.<br />Think about all of the injustices in the world.<br /><br />IXCC, IF YOU GO BANKRUPT AND NEVER SELL ANYTHING AGAIN IT WON'T BE ENOUGH TO PAY ME FOR THIS INJUSTICE."
1,Work well
0,"The case looks and feels decent, but DO NOT buy this case if you are strictly looking for protection. I dropped my LG G4 from waist height onto the wooden staircase i was walking up and the tempered glass screen protector i had on it SHATTERED. I am so glad that i had a screen protector on it, but just realize that this case is not the best when it comes to protection. Also, the plastic band on the bottom of the phone broke off so now theres a piece of plastic just hanging off and its really frustrating.q"
1,"Case fits great and it's nice an sturdy, the only downside is the stand doesn't hold up."
1,"So far so good. I've had this on my Samsung S5 Active since it arrived this past Friday, so 3 days now. I ordered one for my wife as well, same so far. As far as the shipping, I have prime, so as with most everything else that's prime eligible, it arrived within the two day shipping time frame."
1,"Excellent case. Screen protector is very receptive. No clicking noise. Volume and power button tabs work great. Speaker no issues. Charging and headphone doors have no issues. There is no film over home button. The cutout for the vibrate sketch is deep. The cutout for the front camera, earpiece, and sensor no issues. Nice grip to case. No issues for back camera and flash cutout. Recommend this case instead of buying the LifeProof frè. Cheaper, no screen issues, no muffled sound."
1,Good case
1,Met expectations
1,Love so far. 1st impression was great really cute
1,Very satisfied!
-1,Prone to failure.
-1,These chargers didn't last a month. They stopped working.  Very poor quality.
1,Light weight and thin. Kept the same light and thinness of phone. It came with white residue so it made the case look used.
1,nice
-1,"If you are purchasing this phone thinking a person with limited tech ability and/or limited physical function can use it, DON'T!!  I couldn't be more disappointed in it.  The instructions are worthless.  They don't tell you there is not voice mail capability.  The ringer randomly rings.  The speed dial will not accept a number.  I have tried calling the customer service line several times and have sent e-mail questions, with no response!<br />When we get a replacement phone, we are going to celebrate by smashing this with a hammer!!  Anyone not wishing to waste their money should not purchase!"
-1,"As far as the iPhone goes I like it. As far as this particular one, the screen is sometimes unresponsive requiring a restart. Not cool.<br /><br />update. downgrading to one star. it quit on me last night. it is still on, but the screen wont come on. am having to return it and I cant even wipe it before i do. not cool."
1,"Awsome fit, and great feel."
1,It was great everything i wanted in a phone case
-1,Broke too easy.
1,Cables were exactly what I expected.  6 ft length is a plus.
1,I've had these for several months now. They are still working great. I've bought alot of cheap ones that usually stop working after a couple of weeks. I have a feeling these will last awhile. My only complaint is that the platic head that surrounds the tip that plugs into the iphone is big so it may not work with some screen protectors.
1,"This is a great backup charge and a convenient travel outlet. It does get hot but doesn't interfere with fast charging. I use it for my IPad Air, iPhone 6 and Kindle."
1,It was really easy to communicate with them about your design. Came verrrry quickly; considering getting one for my bf's iPhone when he gets one lol
1,Awesome product!! I put on my dashboard weeks ago and it has not moved an inch! It stays in place and I used it as a cell phone holder I can stop suddenly as well as go over bumps and my phone does not move at all. Great product for those who are always using their phone or needing it while in the car and can never find it with this product you put it there and it's always in the right place!! I received this I. Exchange for review great product!!
-1,Did not work. Took a month to get refunded after returning it.
1,REALLY BEAUTIFUL!!
-1,Keeps breaking often. I had lot of high expectations. The first round worked awesome. I thought it really stands out. But however after some time the connections keeps breaking down. I am little disappointed. Will test it for few more days
-1,"Crap product, I took my brand new phone out of the box, never touched the screen, cleaned with enclosed wet cloth then with enclosed micro fiber cloth, and it still won't stick in upper and lower right corners no matter how much I press on it ."
1,"Subtle, lightweight and offers good protection for my S6 active phone and esp. what it lands on."
1,For a Birthday present and it was a hit
1,"My son ordered this, and my husband and I were very skeptical since it is cardboard.  It was very easy to assemble, and works very well!  Very cool product!"
1,So far so good. Just wish it had included a newer iPhone connector.
1,"Being someone who LOVES taking pictures, I needed a tripod and have been searching for  the perfect one and so far this one is pretty good! It is small lightweight and compact. Being a adjustable makes it that much more top notch. It is well made and well worth the money especially if you are outdoorsy and love snapping shots."
-1,Need instructions to return
1,Works well with Kurio and other devices.
1,Great charges phone insanely fast
1,This case is gorgeous and it protects my phone so well! Definitely something I would buy again!
1,Good
1,"Well....I've had almost all of them, tempered glass, Zagg hd wet install...etc. I ended up buying this because I had it briefly on my gs6 and it looked great. I have an iPhone 6 now and was hesitant because of the 3 star rating. I usually don't write reviews but thought this screen protector deserved better than 3 stars. EVERY other screen protector I purchased for this phone had issues, halo, bubbles etc. With this protector if you follow the instructions it works perfectly. No bubbles, no halo, easy install, can barely tell it's there. It won't protect from impact, but that's not what I'm looking for, scratch protection suits me fine. You can't go wrong with this protector for the price, and proper install."
0,Hard to press button at top but otherwise very good
1,Fantastic for the price! I do like the quality. Thanks.
0,"Cons: Heavier than expected, and it slips off my ears.<br />Also, the buttons are very, very, very small - not as easy to use.<br />People felt that my voice wasn't clear - they found it hard to hear what I was saying. Had to revert to other ear phones.<br />In fact, I am not using this Headphone regularly now."
1,Works great for my iphone case that won't fit different types of inputs.
1,So far so good.. the screen cover does seem to scratch/mar easily though so I don't know how long this will last.. the fingerprint verification still works just fine on the S6 (at least for my wife I seem to have issues probably due to messed up fingerprints on my hands due to constant finger owies)
-1,Cheap interface. Never worked with a Samsung Galaxy
1,Perfect fit. Best case I've purchased. Material feels great.
1,Great product fast delivery
1,nice color and good product
1,"Have had this mount for two weeks now and up until today I would have given it four stars.<br />However, riding on the new England roads presents challenges and gear has to hold up. This morning I hit a pot hole that nearly knocked me off my bike, the pothole did, however, knock the mount off my bike with the phone. Given the severity of the hit, I thought for sure my phone was done let alone having any chance of the mount holding up. Well to my surprise, the phone did not have a scratch , dent, or other mark from the incident. The backing of the mount had a few scrapes but otherwise intact. Not only was it intact but I was able to use the mount once I had rebooted my phone. I'm sold on this device."
1,I really love this case. It gives great protection. I think the screen protector that came with it is a bit on the cheap side but that didn't matter to me at all. I love the quality of the phone case. It was a bit hard for me to get it off when I wanted to change my cases though.
1,So far I love this cute case! It looks so good on my space gray iPhone 6 plus.
1,Great
1,"I don't know if it's my phone or the item itself, but I am constantly having trouble connecting to this device with bluetooth (should have opted for a corded model). When it's working, it works great though - hence the 4 stars."
1,"I just got this wonderful  case this morning and I love it! It fit my phone amazingly well! The case was made out of strong material, I tried to pull on it to test the strength of the material and it passed with flying colors.  The colors are very bright just as the picture itself.  Of course the reason for getting the case was the Alice in Wonderland Cat on it.  Shipping was great and tracking was available. It was a great purchase and would recommend to everyone!<br /><br />I received this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,"This is super handy. Works well and keeps out phone right in place. Be careful with the manner though, it put a pretty heavy scratch on the back of my iPhone."
1,Effective but a little pricy.
1,good quaility
1,great
1,Works as advertised.  No Issues.
1,"replaced a older garmin with this one , lifetime free updates and works perfectly"
0,Stitching on Velcro coming undone less than 30 days into purchase. Just general application of on and off. Easy to restitch however that should not have happened
-1,Does not work!! I wouldn't buy from them again!
1,This little stand is great! It holds my iPad and iPhone with ease. I highly recommend this product.
0,"Cheap & it works. The only down side is that it only works plugged in on one side to your phone, whereas the original lightning cable from Apple will work no matter which side you plug into your phone."
1,Was fine
1,I love this Galaxy S6 Edge slim case. I like how it snaps on the back easily. It fits great and is lightweight and not bulky. I like the burgundy color I picked out and they way it looks and fees is great. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
1,Works with Windows 10
-1,"didn't work, bad buy."
1,"Having recently learned about the negative effects of &#34;blue light&#34; - I bought these for me and really like them.  I never noticed it until I put this on the phone, just how much blue light is produced.  My eye doctor suggested getting special lenses for me and my kids, and it occurred to me that this would be a much cheaper solution, and it was!"
1,Built a cooler-stereo with this and it works very well.  It IS waterproof but I did use caulking around it for extra water protection.  Give a good stereo signal though and I would recommend it.  Cheap too.
1,Handy to hold phone in vents so I don't have to look down just takes a little time to create a special bend that works
1,Very useful in keeping my gadgetry peripherals in one place while traveling.
1,Great band for the apple watch sports space grey. Fits perfectly and looks great. One minus point was that it was very hard to resize even qith rhe tools it came with.
-1,"I was disappointed the package arrive past the 26 day window in which I was informed the package would arrive. When I emailed about my concerns, I felt my concerns were not being addressed. Nonetheless, when the product arrived, the case fit but the buttons along the sides that control things like turning the phone off did not align making the case useless. I am frustrated by the entire situation and would recommend not purchasing this product. Spend a few more dollars for one less headache and a product that works as intended."
1,"Really excellent clean, clear sound,  a cleaner sound than the Quadbeat 2 and is biased more towards the highs. The highs are crisp, the bass sounds close to normal, not really much accentuated, but it's tight and  you can get a good thump on some types of music. Great cord that resists tangling, and has no cord bang, although the mic flopping around can bang a little. But really much better than the flat cords out there.  Really great buds overall."
-1,I was not happy with it. Only be cause I thought it was a hard case not just a cover.
1,Excellent product ..4 weeks later still no issue thanks for your service
1,Thanks!
1,"STOP LOOKING! I tried 2 other screen replacements and they either didn't work, or was missing cables. This has it all and spare parts. 5 minute job tops if you already have the screen off."
1,Happy with the purchase especially the price 4 dollars
1,Perfect fit.
1,Great but really hard to remove
1,"Love it, looks nice, fit perfectly"
-1,Sucked. They worked great the first time I used them. Plugged them in the next day and didn't work at all!
0,"It's good but for some reason it opens itself sometimes,"
1,"Just got it and it fits my license, ATM card and AAA card.  It accomodates 5 cards but the back bumps out and difficult to slide open.  I wouldn't suggest more then 3 cards due to card embossing on them adding further thickness."
1,It's nice looking and really fit my phone very well.
1,Great phone case.  Keeps my phone safe from scratches and such.<br />Always getting comments on the cute white dots on red pattern!
1,"Nice quality, saved my phone from a few accidents already"
1,"These cables have a tendency to separate where the adapter fits onto the cable itself, though I suppose they aren't much worse than most other cables. I've replaced two of them now, but for the price, I don't mind it much. They're long and they work well, all things considered."
1,Does all that it is suppose to do.
1,ok
1,"I was so excited to get this product.  I had just recently purchased an iPhone 5s and was looking for something to carry it in.  When I got this case, I immediately put my phone in it and it fit great.  My phone is nice and snug which is one thing I was concerned about - but not anymore!  The reason I rated this a 4 and not a 5 is because I can tell the case is not great quality.  I think it will do the trick for a few months, but I don't expect it to last longer than that.  But for the price, I can buy another one to replace it!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
1,Perfect fit and fast shipment.
1,Very quality product love it thank u seller
1,bought 3 or 4 the the kids they and i are enjoying
-1,"The elastic plastic front is subpar. It has the feel and dirt attraction similar to a kids rubberized toy. It probably will keep your phone protected, but I wasn't willing to test it."
-1,It doesn't work. The cord was disconnected. Rip off
1,;)
1,Beautiful! It's a perfect fit and matches the champagne gold of my phone exactly.
1,Love the phone. Upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the HTC One. Very user friendly. Good price and fast shipping.
1,"Really nice case for the iPhone 6.  My only issue is that it doesn't have a kick stand.  Admittedly, I knew that when I bought it.  However, in hindsight, I should've opt'd for the one that has the stand on it.<br /><br />This is sturdy, fits well, and allows easy access to all of the buttons.  Five stars."
-1,Useless. It does not protect your privacy unless you have the screen completely dim making it hard to use.
1,Works perfectly with my iPhone 6. It's great for my workouts and bike rides.
-1,"Probably fake. Make sure you aren't duped. Was going to purchase it, read the reviews and decided against it."
-1,"its not sturdy at all.... it did not meet any of my expectations... It's not worth it for me to send back.... so maybe I can find someone that can use it.<br /><br />the design is flawed.... the grip for the mounting area doesn't grab to much, you're limited to what it will grab... and then even if you do find a FLAT surface to get it attached to..... it can easily SLIP off when adjusting the phone or the angle.<br /><br />I'm thinking about taking off the mount it came with and using a much stronger grip from like Hone Depot and modify the mount..... if the mount was more universal and STRONG... then the movement, bouncing up n down of the phone would be lessened.<br /><br />unfortunately, I know there may be a few consumers out there that may not be too Technically inclined enough to modify their own.... and Kudos to those that made this thing work for them.... you must be sitting or standing REALLY STILL right about now."
1,"Perfectly good case. Good grip, good protection. It is just too ugly for words....what's an Amzer?"
1,"It worked perfectly. Have had no issues with it, continues to charge with out fail."
1,LOVE this phone wallet case!!  It holds just enough of what I need.  The phone fits securely and the Edge screen is clearly visable.  I like the fact the cards have a separate divider so when using my phone noone can see my cards.  I tend to carry too much and this wallet keeps me to the bare mimimun.  It will close only with a card in each slot and limited cash.  Love the plum color.  May order more!!
1,"Such a great product! It works so well and now my husband can charge his phone, I can chart my phone and we can charge the family iPad all at the same time on our car trips!"
1,Came out good
1,"Works great, higher amperage than many. Nice feature that has a  led readout of voltage / charging amperage."
1,Works great. We now have a single charging station for all our devices. Speedy charging of iPhones.
-1,"It came scratched. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want a screen protector that comes scratched."
1,Great item....beautiful! Thank you!
1,Awesome!
1,"My set arrived with 2 plates missing the stickies.  Not that big of deal, but this is not my first purchase of these type of magnet holders.  One thing to keep in mind, it will mess with your wireless charging capability (the plate interferes).  To work around the Note 4 wireless charging back, I put the metal plate inside the back cover below the contacts so it doesn't short out.  The bulging isn't noticeable with a case on.  As for the Note 5, the phone is metal and actually doesn't require a metal tab; however, once you put a case on it won't hold.  I purchased a Spigen case and put the tab between the rubber case and the shell behind the kickstand.  Wireless charging works with a decent charger, but not a cheap one.  Like instructed, don't pull or slide, but tilt it off and on; it stays put for me.  One recommendation would be to allow the back to be removed and provide a sticky to fasten the magnet directly onto something."
0,"These headphones have decent quality sound, and the earbuds are feel comfortable. However, it is difficult to get the ear hooks over the ear and to stay on securely on the ear. They are usable and stay on for the most part, but they occasionally need to be readjusted. The mic works well for phone calls."
1,Perfect fit
1,"Yes there's no bass but that's why they accompany my Rockford subs so well, all the vocals and instruments from my door speakers, bass from the subs, you cannot go wrong"
0,"The case had a really snug fit, but the clip that it came with fell apart quickly. Fortunately, I rarely use the clip, but still kinda annoying"
1,So far so good.  Had it mounted to my dashboard & it worked great. Did not leave any marks when removed.  Currently have it attached to a weighted sandbag mount that allows me to move it from car to car.  Holds great.  Doesn't lose it's grip on hot days in the sun like the typical suction cup mount.
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
-1,"Was really happy with this case - very slim, unobtrusive, and I police the yellow color, but the it broke literally the next day. The thin piece of plastic between the volume controls and the screen snapped overnight. Pretty disappointing. I hadn't expected a cheap case to last too long, but at least 48 hours?"
1,A great amp.....I scared to order at first even after reading great views. So I went to YOUTUBE.  Then heard the amp on some subs.... OMG. I'm telling all my friends about this amp...The name speaks for it self BAMF
-1,This is a piece of crap.  Doesn't charge well in the sun and lousy operation...not to mention it is huge and bulky.  I wish I had read reviews on it before purchasing. Do yourself a favor...buy a regular outlet unit that will work.  Love to be environmentally friendly but this is a waste of $$!
-1,Not worth it
-1,I am not happy with this product!!! I received the product on 7/5/15 and it stopped working on 8/29/15!!!!
1,great product.
1,"I love it when technology comes together and makes my life so much easier!!! Celtronix was on point with their Multi-Port Quad USB 4 Port Wall Charger! I do own another adapter that is similar to this that I keep at home; this one will be utilized at work amongst my coworkers and I.<br /><br />My coworkers love to see what new gadgets I get and was very pleased to see that I had something for all of us to use!! We are not allowed, well, not supposed to, use the computers at work to charge our phones for fear of viruses and what not. So we no longer have that issue!<br /><br />At work, we literally have one power outlet for all of us to share. I brought this nice Quad USB Wall Charger in and one would have thought we hit the lottery! They were so pleased all 3 of us got to use the wall outlet at the same time with the use of this handy piece of equipment.<br /><br />Prior to using this USB Wall Charger at work, I tested it at home. I made sure to check for warmness or any hot feelings to touch to the USB charge, wall outlet, and cable cords. My findings were a tad bit of warmness. The charger did not over heat nor did I find any problems to my charging cord.<br /><br />We are pleased with this device and have not complaints. It is compact, lightweight, easy to use, store, and travel with.<br /><br />I was chosen to review this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
1,My husband has been using this with his Galaxy for several weeks now.  It's perfect as his phone overheats frequently on long trips so he can keep it cool in front of the vent.  It holds his phone and my iPhone 5S perfectly.  My only complaint would be that it leans forward some but it really isn't a big deal.
1,Works great! I would recommend using something bigger than the lens to press it in place. Which is why I am buying it again....
1,Very nice!!! My son love it😀
1,Cool ohone case and protects my screen.
1,Happy with it. I bought it for my husband who was always losing his phone but with the bright color he finds it fast.
-1,"I don't believe this hard cover case is for a Apple Touch 1st Gen.  The power switch opening is on the wrong side.  As others stated there is no volume openings on the left side. As far as the strength of the case, I can see where there can be some concerns ( but I have not drop it yet).  The reasons I gave it two stars was the screen is protected some what.  Finally, I do like the clear appearance.  If I could have seen it up close, I would not have purchased this case. I can't recommend this product."
1,"It works just like an oversized Android phone. I love it! It also has Microsoft Word,  Excel, PowerPoint, etc... I inserted a 64g SanDisk memory card for extra storage.<br /><br />The only issue I had; I ordered a few protective cases and they were the wrong size. The size were for Galaxy Tab 8 which is totally different from the Tab A. The Tab A is much bigger! But it's cool 👌 I love it 💖<br /><br />If you decide to purchase it...enjoy! It's very fast too! Although it doesn't stay connected to the Internet for long periods."
1,Item arrived quickly and works just as it is supposed to.
-1,The plastic case frame cracks and breaks easily. I just got mine and used it for a week. I dropped my phone on the carpet and the whole frame cracked and chipped.
-1,"Worked fine for 2 weeks, then bricked.  Got it mainly to help keep track of swimming laps.  Off by close to 100 yards plus or minus any given mile swim. Close enough.  Would eventually have tried the golf and Cycling features.  Now does not work at all. After charging it stuck in update mode all day and now nothing.   Update ... It mysteriously started working again after about 2 months.  Used it the rest of the summer for recording laps and it worked pretty well. also used it for steps and stationary bike a few times.  Now it just stopped recording steps when i walk or distance.  It will show distance as the crow flies from a starting point so basic GPS seems to be working.  It also displays time and date, but that is all. Will NOT connect to Garmin for updates."
1,"Got it to replace a oumax watch that failed, I have grown to really like this watch. Took a few days, but now very happy with the purchase."
-1,It didn't charge my Samsung well
-1,"I got my pair on Prime Day right after the prime stock ran out. Mine came from China, and included Chinese packaging, instructions, etc. Everything about the headphones looks great. Unfortunately, the sound quality is terrible. Everything sounds really canned, and I've tested with multiple devices as well as against other pairs of headphones. In addition, the microphone is worthless for a smartphone because every time I've attempted to use it whoever was on the other end was bombarded by other noise in the room.  I've heard elsewhere that there are companies cloning these headphones, so I should've expected this."
-1,"Thought it was a great case, but then the sleep/wake button at the top of of the case broke off. Spigen won't fix or replace even though the case is only 5 months old because I brought it through an authorized retailer (Amazon)."
1,"This was purchased to provide 'off grid' charging for my iPhone, iPad etc.... and it has been awesome. It can charge cycle my phone 3 or 4 times easily on one main unit charge. It takes care of my iPad too. I have been very impressed with its ability to hold its charge and how long it can efficiently charge my electronics without dying.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it!"
1,Came faster than the expected delivery date. I love it!!!
1,Don't have a friend kick the cord sending it sideways from the plugged in phone and it works great. The end snapped off in my iphone charging dock at about the time my friend was learning if the consequences.
1,good deal and great product
1,Love it 😍
0,Glue is very weak.
1,Exactly what was needed at a great price.
1,As advertised.
0,Great product but not good for high usage.
1,Excellent item. God bless you.
1,You can't go wrong with this one. Really easy to pair with my IPhone 6. It expands way too long with a decent hold.
-1,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
0,I like it but dislike the app
1,I love this case! It fits my phone perfectly. I was worried that i wouldnt be able to get my stylus pen out but have no problem. And the lightning bolt is just like the picture.
1,very satisfied. thank you.
-1,"The charger arrived on time, but didn't work that well. The bit that goes into the phone was loose and I had to balance it very carefully to get my phone to charge at all. I only kept the charger for a couple of days before I got too frustrated and had to replace it."
1,It makes my Iphone look nice!
1,"This product has only been used daily out only used in my house, not wrapped up or thrown in a bad or anything else. It stopped working properly today. I just bought it March 30, 2015. It has a one year warranty so I will be returning it. It's a hassle to return and I didn't expect to wear out so soon."
1,The armband is fantastic for the Galaxy S4. It's everything one would want in an armband. It's great that there is no plastic screen cover so it's easy to actually use the phone while it's in the skin. They did however include 2 screen protectors with the product which is really cool. I highly recommend it for those who have the S4.
1,does it's job
1,Better than otterbox cases
1,Good product.
1,Top of the line. Great investment to protect my phone and looks great at the same time !
1,"Nice and long, charges quickly"
1,Functions as advertised.
1,"Its working great so far its been a little over a month. few things i dont like are its too bulky, the phone gets EXTREMELY hot when charging, you cant charge with a normal iphone charger. but those are honestly all pretty minor issues the case works great, they raised the price recently which was upsetting i was gonna order another one but not anymore."
1,"Fantastic case but the only downside is that the side buttons are more equipped for the iPhone 5 not 5c as advertised. I have to push to hard and I don't want to damage iPhone itself. This item is great, protects otherwise!"
-1,"I have a problem with a proximity sensor because there is no hole on  the protector it is transparent so whenever i make a call the screen is totally dimmed i cant open the pad or even hang up the call so i have to usa the headset, for the privacy it is good but it is anti finger printing"
1,Its really nice because its literally just like a wallet.
-1,"its a decent phone case however after about three months the kickstand broke on me, and also trying to get this case off of your phone is a pain in the rear. i hope you have some tools to pry it off or some strong fingers"
0,This item is not to bad it looks good but i find it connecting a little slow.
1,great!
1,This is a nice stand for the apple watch making it very easy to slip it on to charge at night. The bamboo wood is a nice light pine style color. I'd use it more for my phone but there is no way to attach the lightning end of the charger cable so you have to fish for it each time which just feels a little awkward for a stand. If they could include a simple way to fix the cable in the right position to push the phone into it would get 5 stars.
1,I love this product can charge multiple devices and it holds a charge great.  My only complaint is the amount of time it takes to charge the battery if low.  It seems like it takes a long time.  But overall extremely pleased and it is a great value for the money.
1,Perfect
-1,Cheaply made and broke a few weeks after having it.
1,A card doesn't fit all the way in but I do keep some cash in it otherwise I like this case I wish it had more colors as I really  don't like the ones offered but that is totally  preference it works great with my edge and isn't to bulky..
-1,"Did not match up, had 2 order pioneer brand"
1,Great fit and slim.  Offers ample protection.
1,"The selling point for this power bank is its portability; it can easily be kept in your pocket, purse or backpack to be carried with you: 5.5 inches long, 2.75 inches wide, about 1/4 of an inch thick, and it weighs in at about 5.3 ounces per our postal scale.<br /><br />Interesting device. Operating this battery is a breeze -- just charge it up and then connect it to your Apple lightning compatible device with the built-in, very short lightning cable.<br /><br />This unit is priced at the top of the range for a power bank with 3200mAh capacity, especially since it's output flow is under 2.A (1.6A rated), and it can only be used to charge devices that use a lightning connection. Would recommended it if you are looking for a super portable power bank like this, just to have in case of an emergency.<br /><br />Extremely portable; if you are looking for a battery pack of this size, style and capacity, for use as I have described above, then give this thin lightning compatible power bank a try.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience."
1,just wanted an extra one
-1,It's terrible! My mute button didn't work even if I took the rubber ban off. The lock button don't work. IT WAS BROKE WHEN I RECIEVED IT!!! Don't waste your time or money on it....
-1,"Although a high quality item, it did not stay connected properly to the iPhone with a proper fit on the charging cord, possibly an old design fit for an earlier iPhone than the 6."
1,like the way it is able to be attached vertical or horizontal... handy that the air from the vent keeps the phone cool --
1,It came on time. I like it.
-1,This product does not work with the IPhone 5s. Would not recommend anyone buying this product. Amazon's abbreviated return policy does not allow me to return this product even though I am a prime member.
1,"This is a great phone, truly, for the price. Need little work on the configuration. I am using H2o 4G LTE network."
-1,This is one of the worst products i have ever purchased from amazon. I got 1 star because i hade to click one to submitt it. Problem is that I had the case for less than 3 weeks and it was already peeling. I have taken the case off my phone because all the peeling makes it look ugly and trashy. So this was a bad product. I will tell anyone NOT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!! ITS HORRIBLE!!!!
1,Wife is happy with this product.
1,Bought one of tbese from a local audio shop. BANGS. i highly recommend this sub.
1,cheap is always good
1,Good product but does not fit Sprint phone's buttons. Verizon only.
1,"I had to upgrade my car mount to fit my iPhone 6. I did some research and came across this and it had about 2000 review with 4 stars. It is not common on Amazon to see that many good reviews for a specific product.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- The suction cup is very good and basically works everywhere on my dashboard. I see that some people had an issue of the suction cup leaving a mark on there dash board but mine didn't even after leaving my car in direct sunlight for some time.<br />- There are many ways you can put it and it allows for adjustments to your liking.<br />-Fits many phones with no problem.<br />-Easy mechanism to attach and remove your phone, which I really like.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Feels cheap but I can't complain to much considering that I have purchased more expensive mounts that broke.<br />-The adjustment knob gets itself loose after a few bumpy rides. This is annoying because I constantly have to adjust it while driving.<br /><br />Over all it's is a great product and I have been using it for quite a few months now with no major issues."
1,It works well.. kudos
1,It very good good thank you
1,Love it just what I wanted
-1,"The macro lens got stuck after putting it into the clip for the first time, making the Fish Eye lens unusable. I tried everything to get that lens out but it wouldn't budge. The threading must've been off or something."
-1,"Could never get rid of dust particles/bubbles.  Believe they came from wipe and cheap microfiber cloth.  Very disappointed in this, tried the tape but when you lift to use tape it just gets worse.  Also, didn't feel directions were clear that came with box.  Website had better insight but unfortunately by then my cover was full of dust particles.  I would not recommend this."
1,"I love it! The quality isn't the absolute best but it's good enough and the colors are so pretty, I've had for months now and still can't bring myself to change it for another one, even though I like change themy often"
1,Great case
1,Very HAPPY with my case. Just what I expected
-1,"Had trouble pairing with Samsung Galaxy because the instructions are misleading. When you hold the power button down as they specify you get a blinking light, but that isn't the pairing mode. You have to hold it down longer until  you get a much brighter flashing red and blue light to enter pairing mode.    Once you get them working you will want to know that you no longer have to hold a cell phone to your ear with one hand, but instead you have to use both hands to hold the ear buds in order to keep them from falling on the floor. Maximum volume is barely sufficient and the quality is just ok for phone but volume and quality not very good for music, and besides who can listen to music having to keep spitting on your ear buds to get them to stay in your ears for at least another 15 seconds?   Truly a piece of garbage."
1,excellent product
1,"I love this little thing! I now have a few of these since I've purchased this first one! They are not only convenient because you only need one outlet port to charge up to 6 devices.  They are small enough you can put them in drawers and what not to keep out of the way! The quickcharge 2.0 port works significantly faster when charging my m8.  The other ports recognize what device you plug in and adjusts accordingly.  This is great for families, the tech nerd or the business man/woman on the go.  These are great for just about anyone these days with all of the devies that people have!<br /><br />Would purchase again!<br /><br />Note: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review"
1,Works great in fact I'm buying another one.
1,Cute case however strap is not very sturdy
1,Works as advertised.
1,Great. Besides when talking on phone others can't hear you very good
-1,"I had some shipping problems so I just reiceived it yesteday. The phone turn on the first time and worked fine, but today it just shut down. Im conecting it to the wall charger, but its dead."
1,Good product for a fraction of the price! Works great! Covers the expensive watch nicely.
1,Ot is good
1,"This is a GREAT CASE! Yes, it looks as good in real life, as it does in the picture. It functions great too! Seriously, i couldn't be happier. I got it in two days, too."
1,Fits nice. The swivel is kind of funky.
1,Dropped my phone 4-5 times on accident after putting the case on. Still not one scratch on my phone.
-1,"When I received my item in the mail I noticed that the plastic case packaging was cracked in 2 separate spots that went all the way through to the other side and the screen protector was bent, I applied it to my phone and have to constantly apply pressure to keep it flush with the phone."
1,Great case for being cheap. Plastic is weak and broke in the thin spots within the first week. Looks very slick tho.
-1,these r junk buy a real cell phone name brand
0,Nice holder gives thickness to a thin phone.
1,"This review is 2 years overdue, my apologies.<br />I actually purchased these for my best friend and she loved them. For as long as she had the phone until she upgraded to the newer Samsung Galaxy phone she only used one of the three screen protectors that this came with. They are that good that she didn't even need to use a second one."
1,Thank you
-1,It doesn't work
1,Bought two of these and so far so good. Had to get one replaced but Anker resolved my issue very quickly! Hopefully they last which is the hope for ANY brand of lightning cable..
-1,The colors are very dull.  Fit the phone as expected.  Disappointed in the appearance.
1,"very loud for its size... I work in a factory plant where its loud ... there is a lot of fork lift traffic so having earphones is very dangerous because you can not hear them coming or honking.... so the fact that you can just hang this on your belt loop, you can keep your ears wide open to hear anything and in the mean while enjoy your music"
1,Nephew loved it
-1,"Worked okay for the first couple weeks or so. Then the cord started generating noise and static. Wiggling the cord at the 3.5mm end alleviates the noise slightly, but you can still hear it in the background. I really expected a better product from Sony."
1,I like my product
1,Very good
1,Work as a police officer needed something when I ride the quad on the beach to hear.
-1,Well - this did not work well. It broke while attaching it to the bike - the locking handle just decomposed into pieces. That pretty much ended the ability to use the product. Do not recommend buying this item.
0,"it works, but it also blocks your vent and prevents you from adjusting vent direction."
0,It does what it supposed to do. The connection to the usb cable is quite sluggish and easily come a part. Also sometimes even it change the color to green as fully charged when I put the batteryin gs5 it shows only 95% or so. Not 100%. Guess you get what you pay for...
1,"Best FM transmitter that I've purchased, and the USB port is really useful."
1,"Love it! I had this same screen protector for 2 Years and it's great, the only screen protector that has truly protected my screen from cracking!!"
1,pretty good
-1,Stopped working after one month
1,"Small, portable product for a great price.  Huge plus, the battery lasts a long time!  Use this product daily."
1,"Great sturdy case, holster holds live securely ave the holster clips onto belt smoothly avid secure. Very firm nicely engineered case.  Can't beat the price for such a good case."
1,Works great!
1,"Case is wonderful, protects the phone really well with it's TPU insert and hard case. The stand is a nicety that works well, and the side buttons feels tactile with good feedback. After 6 months of use and countless drops the case holds up exceptionally well. The aesthetics however is another story, the TPU insert is starting to discolor toward a slight brownish hue, the buttons coating is wearing off (but still works well), and the worst part is that the stand broke off. I can put up with the discoloration, but I really wish the stand was built stronger to last the expected abuse."
1,Color/picture is just as vivid as on the Internet.  Case fits iPhone 6 perfectly. My 12 year old loves it! It even has a little pocket for her lunch money.
-1,Item is junk. Broke in 4 days. Do not buy
1,Awesome item definitely comes in handy.
0,"EDIT- I had to return the first of the two I bought after three weeks because the jack where the power cable joins the charger had become loose at first (intermittently wouldn't work- had to jiggle it), and then wouldn't hold a connection at all, even taping it together. They were good about refunding me the first one. Now it's 8 weeks and I the second one has developed the same problem. I would point out that both of these items have been left alone-- they just sit on my desks at home and at work and don't get jostled around.   But I give credit to this seller. Even after 9 weeks, they refunded me for the second charger with no questions asked."
1,Great little selfie!
1,"Very handy, makes for a much more secure feel"
1,"Good sturdy case. Works great for me. The only issue is the thin rubber base at the.bottom of the phone, hence the four stars and not five"
0,Nice
1,Perfect protection & easily accessible once you get it broke in or used to the one handed technique to get it off the holster.
1,"Great product, GREAT experience!"
0,"headphones work but remote does not!! now I have to spend extra on remote, if i can only find it!!"
1,Good items
1,I luv it. I will order another one.
1,Awesome
1,I am very pleased with this wireless charger.. It works great.
1,Blu makes great devices. This is a tablet but it can't be use as a cell phone. For me it's a little awkward because it's a little too big. But it's great the image is very clear it's very sturdy product.
-1,Theseare a joke. I tossed them in the trash. That fall apart and got in the way of driving.
1,"I received my items fast and it was unfortunate that I had received a bad battery but after contacting the company and telling them about my issue, they were more than willing to send me a new battery. These batteries have been a life saver to me and I would definitely recommend it."
1,"I love this phone case because if it's multiple uses. It's not cheaply made, it has stood against my teething child gnawing on it with no wear to show for it. The design is adorable! Overall, this was an awesome purchase, well worth it, came earlier than expected, no issues. Would definitely purchase from this seller again."
1,Fast shipping. Charge does not last as long as previous batteries
1,These things are pretty straightforward. Works just like it should.
-1,"it broke so easily, on my first week the glass cracked  across<br />with my first phone drop"
1,"Product arrived in good condition, was easy to install znd fit the Samsung Galaxy 4 phone well. Only thing I've noticed is that touchscreen seems  more sensitive than old one. Sometimes when I'm talking on phone, it seems that my ear pressing against glass opens up other apps or screens!"
1,Very happy with quality and performance.
1,look fine have not used yet
-1,I have in iPhone clock base I plug in to at nite. The bottom of this case won't work
1,Awesome deal awesome product
-1,Worked at first. Tried it again and could not get it to work.
1,"Works as described, but does come off easily."
1,Protects phone nicely. Only complain is it makes the phone bulky
1,this new tom tom is great as other one was old and would tell you to turn after you past the street or exit. thank you
0,"It is a great case. However, the sides are very stiff and cover the buttons so I had to push extremely hard to press any of the side or top buttons. It was very frustrating."
-1,Item didn't fit very well and it was very difficult to push the buttons
-1,"Only two of three lens came, and of course, the lens I wanted (the macro) was the one that didn't arrive."
1,"Used it for three weeks throughout a tour of the British Isles.  Worked great.  Really nice to have the four USB ports what with two cell phones, an iPad and a Kindle along with two Halos.  And friend who forgot his Kindle charger."
-1,the belt clip broke in less then ten hours on my belt
1,Works Great. Just as advertised.
0,Good quality but breaks often
1,WORKS FINE AND FITS TIGHTER THAN THE ONE THAT CAME WITH THE PHONE
1,The best freaking cell I have every had. No more touch screens for me
1,"This is a great little fitness tracker, especially for the price. My only complaint is that I bought a slim wristband and it had a tendency to unclasp and fall off my wrist. It wasn't that big of a deal until it fell off when I was out in the woods. Get in the car, look down and oops! No more fitness tracker. Wah, wah.<br /><br />Since my basic tracker was MIA, it was time for an upgrade. I looked at several trackers that offered some pretty fierce competition with Jawbone's newer bands, both in price and capabilities, and I stayed with the Jawbone simply because their customer service is really really good. If you have any problems with any of your bands, give them a call and they will make it better."
1,Very Nice headphones for the school
1,good product works very well. Good service from seller
1,"Image is sturdy, buy it hold dirt."
1,"I did not want to pay the price for Samsungs wireless charger. I found this one and gave it a try. It may not charge as fast as Samsungs, but it definitely gets the job done. The blue light looks good as its charging. Just an FYI if you use this by your bed at night, it will definitely light up the room. As it charges the blue light turns on and off. When it is charged the blue lignt turns solid. Overall its great and I would recommend it."
-1,It's not like the original back prongs are to big
-1,"I had it for about two weeks, and it broke .<br />It worked greatly , just broke very easily ."
1,Excellent product.  Bought 3 for a vacation where I would be away from power sources.  There worked far beyond expectations.
1,good
1,Nice case
1,I was surprised that it is very good and it has a sticker guide that helps it adhere to the exact position..  There are is a halo effect on it and that is because of the curved screen on the phone..
1,Good Quality 👍
1,"I have to say, it's worth the price for what it does, anti-scratch class screen protector and it also prevents the screen from shattering."
-1,Was not what I expected. Cheaply made.
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
-1,"When plugged in to my Apple iPad Air, it says &#34;not charging&#34;, &#34;non certified product&#34;.  But, it does seem to charge the iPad.  Not thrilled.  BTW, both cables do this."
1,Came in before the shipping date. Looks exactly like pictures. Very durable. Love this case
-1,Allergic reaction to the metal clasp and the strap cracks as soon as you bend it back to put it through the clasp.
1,Just wat she wanted
1,Fast shipping/good product
1,So far is good lets see ho long will last
1,Our nephew loved his little watch and it fit his tiny 3 year old wrist perfect. I liked that the watch band is made of a soft plastic that one can just wipe clean and its comfortable for him to wear.
1,Excellent quality. Love that the case is detachable and that the protective case is thin so still fits with factory belt clip.  Love it!
1,Easy connection but can't use it with the cassette for better quality sound as hoped as it squelches really badly no matter the volume.  When using the low FM receiver function on it we find that the lower station frequencies are now so crowded with religious channels that it is impossible in some areas to listen to your music as the stations bleed through.
-1,Horible !  It broke down in 6 weeks
1,everything good!
1,"The phone is alive again for another two years, great.!!"
-1,"The quality seem very good at first, but I had problems trying to turn it off and processing through the menu. I have owned this model for appox six months. I don't know if the summer heat in the car. got to it, which may be affecting it. Maybe the low price is not such a long lasting good deal."
1,Great value
-1,Microphone did not work.Picked up a hum sound no matter what I turned oof. Sent back for refund.
1,works great!!
-1,This replacement screen is noticeable smaller than the original size.  Not happy with the product.  I would recommend purchasing from another vendor.
1,"They are perfect, and price was great!"
-1,It fits well on my iPod touch 4th generation. BUT......... The rubberized later is kind of loose so it might not protect as well as one may want.
0,Worked to charge but not for data.
1,thanks
1,Works great!
-1,"This case look really nice, when ordering it, but looks like a 10 year old made it, not happy at all"
1,Was a gift.
1,"Very easy to put on , works really  good"
0,So far I have found that the flash on the camera does not work.
1,This is a wonderful can the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. It really protect the phone in it entirety. The only thing this case is missing is being waterproof. That would make the case even better
1,"Came quickly , exceeds expectations"
1,It's not as private as some but it doesn't have the annoying little lines in it that others have. Excellent product!!!!
1,always ready when my phone's battery is about to die
1,I've been looking for a phone case for my Galaxy S5 for a while now and all that I could find were boring. This one had me a little worried at first since my experience with gem stones on phone cases had never been good since they tend to fall off easily.<br />This case not only looks cute but it's made of quality. I'm not sure what they used to get this gem stones on and to stay on but whatever it is it works! I can actually put my phone in my pocket without my phone case falling apart.<br /><br />*I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review
1,Fast shipping. Great price. Good power. Nice crossover.
0,Didn't work with my provider. Should have checked the band's before purchase. Seemed fine though.
0,"I have had 2 of these cases and loved the convenience. They protect my phone well and are super handy. The only reason I can't give five stars is that they only last 2-3 months before the prongs on the id holder door break off and you can no longer use it as a wallet. After having this happen twice I just decided to buy a nice wallet (wristlet) with a phone pocket on the side.<br /><br />For the price, it's not a bad little case. Good for a concert or vacation!"
1,Great price and just what I wanted. Fas shipping to boot!
-1,worst ear piece.. NOT clear BREAKS QUICK
1,Perfect
1,"Thay are great sounds great performs awsome, I recamend them to anyone"
-1,"Bought this 2 weeks ago, already doesn't work..."
1,I know these will be a hit for my Grandkids for part of Christmas...
1,Thanks  I love it
1,"My phone charges in 1 hour with Anker cables and 4 hours with cheap $1 cables. The difference is probably lower resistance, thicker gauge wire, which means less voltage loss between your charger and your device (phone). Good build quality. I use the longest cable reaches the back seat of a sedan when plugged into the DC power socket (cigarette adapter) next to the stereo."
1,Item worked great.
1,Great item
1,"This is the perfect wallet case. I bought for my husband who hates to carry his wallet and credit cards. He now carries his phone, drivers lic and 2 credit cards with some money and it all fits in 1 case. Does not take up much space and he says it still fits in his pocket if he doesn't want to carry it. I give it 5 stars."
1,"The Apple Ipad Mini case, I received was perfect for my usage, which is to make handling of the very slippery Ipad easier. I use my Ipad exclusively as a monitor for my DJI Phantom drone and the fact the the cover is transparent and offers good tactile grip makes it ideal for my use."
-1,Worked for the first day then my phone stopped reading with this cord. Not worth it.
1,Work just like it was supposed to
1,works fine
1,"A great case, that's actually made to fit the Droid Turbo (Ballistic Nylon version).  Sleek, stylish and overall great design."
-1,poor fit compared to the schoche. Makes the head unit sit too far back
1,I love it.
1,Great product....will buy it again
1,Cute!
1,"I'm not big on trying to &#34;sell&#34; something - but I can tell you that I have had 3 different UP bands - have always upgraded to the next one coming out and I have been extremely fortunate in that I picked a &#34;great&#34; tracker, I am also fortunate in that Jawbone Customer Service is the best.  I love the slim design of the UP2 - the clasp took me a couple minutes but I can get it off and on with no issues and  love that I can adjust it.  The &#34;tapping&#34; took a bit to get used to but once you do it's great.<br />If I had any complaints it would be the charger - it's probably me but I rarely get the charger hooked to the band the first time.  I tend to have to mess around with it to get it into a position on my desk that I can actually get it to start charging. I'll work that out in time.<br />I give this tracker an A+ and an A+ to Jawbone Customer Service."
1,"I really like this case because it isn't bulky and lets you enjoy the sleek design of the phone. It feels safe and very sturdy even though the two parts of this case slide together. Once you place your phone in it, its a little tough to remove it which is great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have after market chargers and the opening for the lightning charge port is not small to accommodate other after market USB chargers outside of the apple brand and similar size ones."
1,bought this for my nephew. He just loves it.
0,"Not the most comfy, didn't have multiple ear fittings. It actually seamed used but it worked fine. I decided to keep it since it did work."
1,Was delivered as promised and received what I expected. I can't ask for anything more.
1,Its good
1,Easy to apply and good fit . seems thick and protective
1,Good case
-1,"Returned it would not work with my phone, waiting for credit."
1,I really love my case.
1,Great case fits the phone perfectly
1,It fits very comfortable and I wear it for 8 hours a day and it does not bug me
1,As advertised.
-1,"Just to be blunt, I dropped my phone with this case on it and the screen cracked... Useless!"
1,works well
-1,"This product worked very well from May until August.  I used this product Thursday, August 27, working normally.  I charged it at night, but when I tried to use it Friday morning, they did not work.  I assumed I did not charge it long enough, so I tried charging them again.  Much to my dismay, they are completely unresponsive.  When I plug it in to charge it, the light turns on, but when you disconnect it and turn it on, nothing.  I think I would have been better off just spending more money on a brand name that will work longer."
1,High quality cable at an incredible price! Plastic is solid on connectors and the shielding is thick. This looks like it will last. I will update if anything happens to this cable.
-1,"I really liked these at first.  I like to listen to audio books and be able to answer my phone.  I didn't get many complaints about volume issues with this pair.  I bought these for $18 and Cootree Jogger for $30, www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KQG6QFG, they have come down to $24.  With the Cootree I get lot's of volume complaints for the mic, whereas these had very few.  What I did notice was these had a shorter battery life by far, so I ended up using the other pair.  I would switch out when the battery went low but I noticed that that I was using the other pair 3 to 4 times as long.  They would last days and this pair would last 1/2 a day.  Still the mic was good so in the car was better with these.<br /><br />OK so because of the battery, which I don't think was bad as they would play music or books for hours, 6-8 hours, but just not close to the other, I ended up using them infrequently.  I noticed that one side's earpiece was separating at the seam about two weeks ago.  I took some electrical tape and taped it as I've read the reviews on the plastic going around the ear breaking.  I'll add my photos to the product page.  Well I wish I taped the other side too but I didn't notice any wear or separation so didn't.  The other side broke within two weeks.<br /><br />Since I had these only since April, that's a little less than 5 months, and I wasn't using them as my main pair.  Not worth the $18 as if they had been my main pair they would've broke in a month or two."
1,Love my case! It meets all expectations. I've had it less than a week and have already been receiving compliments.
1,"I  like  this  phone  better  than  the  gusto 3  ( newest model )  ,  chiefly  because  of  the  speaker  phone  is  much  crisper  in  sound  quality..."
1,Received the tempered glass screen protector on the day they said it would arrive. I have a moto g 2gen and this product fits perfect. So easy to install. I love this protector its crystal clear. It also has a lifetime warranty which is one reason i decided to buy. Would definitely recommend this to others.
-1,Not the best quality as most of these are.
-1,"The title of the publication says 3350 mAh, but in the technical specifications set in the battery says 3200 mAh. Why the difference ?"
-1,I-5 phone wont recognize these half the time
1,Nice item. Works well.
1,Awesome case perfect for that phone. Thanks.
-1,Worked great for a couple weeks then nothing. This is my second one with the same result.
-1,Way to tight. Be careful I am afraid it will break your phone. It did mine :(
1,"Love the sound, and it's a great value too."
1,"When this is fully charge, it will give about 2 full charges to my iPhone 5s. I had this abroad in Europe with me and was so helpful when travelling. Fully recommend for those travelling!"
1,This really holds my Garmin in place on my large van dashboard.  Great product!
1,"It was okay, not the best quality but you get what you paid for."
1,"Fits my sons Galaxy S5 perfectly, not too bulky and should provide excellent protection for his phone."
1,nice
1,Great case.  Very durable.  I have gotten several compliments on it.  Simple and not bulky.
1,Works great doesn't bother me at all while I am working out or running.
1,It's great.
-1,Did not fit snugly onto phone.
-1,The plastic casing is brittle a breaks easily. I was only able to use me case for two weeks before it was so cracked and broken it wouldn't hold my phone any longer.
1,Love it! I have had my first one for almost two years. We use it on a weekly basis and it works great.
1,Battery life is 2 days with everything on!  some say it makes the phone too big but i think its easier to hold and handle. It charges fast and lasts twice as long! Im very happy with this purchase The $8.00 honeycomb rubber case fits slightly loose and protects ok for the price. Strongly suggest the Seidio DILEX extended case. Cost more but protects better.
0,"Heavy and does keep the GPS in the position it needs to be.  But, it isn't as pictured.  There is no cutout for the GPS to sit behind.  It's more of a donut shape. It causes the GPS to have to point upward awkwardly because the arm mount of our Garmin isn't tall enough to reach above the outside.  We sent it back because it bothered us but some might find this acceptable.  Otherwise, the quality was great, heavy fabric and heavy overall to prevent slippage."
1,"I've received a lot of compliments on the beautiful design. I really enjoy the case and it is a comfort that it gives my phone an extra layer of protection. I also like not having to carry a purse, or juggle a phone and wallet, for quick trips. I especially love the convenience when I am on my bike. The magnetic strap keeps the wallet closed. There is a window space for an ID, and a second slot to keep a debit/credit card or two. There is also a pocket for bills, but no way to store coins. The quality of the case is very nice. Beautiful stitching, well constructed holder that your phone snaps into, keeping it secure, and easy to clean material.  I set it down on a splotch of tomato sauce and it wiped right off without staining. This is the first phone wallet I've purchased for myself. I am really enjoying it. I plan to purchase other patterns from this company. They have great style.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount to test and provide my honest review."
-1,It does not fit. I have been meaning to return it. How do I go about sending it back?
1,"Even through I have only had it for a couple days, I have not found any flaws! This product is amazing! I love it so much! It also stretches to about 3 feet!"
1,"Perfect fit, as described and arrived early. Protects phone very well."
0,"It is probably ok on some vehicles. However, I bought mine for a Chevy Traverse.The Vents are recessed just enough to need to stalk of the car mount to be longer than it is."
1,excellent
1,"Have been using this product for about a month and it really works great. Works like the original lg battery however lasts for much longer I charge it at night while im sleeping and it keeps my phone working for 2 , sometimes 3 full days, depending on usage."
1,Awesome sound quality. Must purchase
-1,doesn't hold up well
1,Excellent quality.  I like that the length is very long so I can watch TV way across the<br />room with my headphones. Thank you.
1,Just what we were looking for!
1,Used on my last trip. You can charge too devices at once.
1,I am very pleased with my Pyle Rear View camera. I did buy the wireless sending unit which made installing it a lot simpler by not having to fish wires from back to the front of my  a van. Also the camera was easier to adjust. Only one small hole to drill and camera mounted on license plate. works very well.
1,Works!
1,I love it great product....
1,Works very well and length is perfect! Very pleased
1,Super Cute. Has a faint weird smell but can't really tell unless your nose is smashed into the case.
1,Lots of features and possibilities. Sometimes to much information during the exercise. The instruction manual could be more detailed to allow a more straight forward configuration.
-1,"OK guys, get out your rulers again.  This is not a 6&#34; fan.  Overall frame is 4-3/4 inches square x 1 inch deep.  Fan blade diameter is 4-3/8 inches."
-1,This item is nowhere near the quality of it's competitors. I wish I would have just purchased the slightly more expensive [[ASIN:B00HAAJQ2Q Cellet Ultra-Thin (0.3mm) High Transparency 9H Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Note 3]]. The cellet was the first screen protector I had purchased and it lasted comparatively longer that this product. This protector scratched almost immediately when it fell out of my pocket while working underneath my truck. The cellet has experienced this multiple times without a scratch.
1,Great case and looks very nice !
1,"This is the best charger I've ever used. I'm surprised how much enthusiasm I can have for a car charger, but this little charger is seriously great. It charges faster than any charger (car or wall) that I've ever used. I can run Pandora over Bluetooth and have Google Maps running when I'm driving, and the phone will still get to 100% charge by the time I get where I'm going."
1,"Wonderful, thank you."
1,The Velvet Skin Coat arrived on time and in good condition. The product is as promised and looks great. I don't wear makeup but it makes my skin looks smooth when I put it with my moisturizer.
1,Wow! Great product.  Fast shipping.  Can't ask for more : D
1,"Pros:  Installs way easier than plastic film covers. Incredibly slick and smooth,  even more elegant to the touch than the original screen.  Very resistant to scratch.  No regrets at all.<br /><br />Cons:  On the Note 4, the protector doesn't cover the outer 2 millimeters around the edges, because the original screen is slightly rounded, and thus a wider flat protector would not adhere. It is very minor, the unprotected part is very small and negligible,  thus I still give this 5 stars."
1,Good GPS. I needed it for both US and canada and it works. The traffic informations give you the right indications to avoid traffic on your way.<br />Need to buy new maps for my next trip in Europ. Gonna see if it's working then.
1,I love the longer length and it works well
1,Love the length and it works great!
-1,Terrible! Phone will not even turn on properly. It really is a hit or miss when it comes to these discounted batteries. I wish I had tried installing sooner before I lost the window to return.<br /><br />The NY Sticker was no where to be found at all.<br /><br />Hopefully the attached link could give you some insight on the battery you receive &#34;see cycle count&#34;. I wish I had not waited so long and very disappointed in this product.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOOZZeTTR1o
1,"This is fantastic! I have been looking for something that is large enough to fit my iPhone 6 plus while I run. I cannot tell you how amazing this arm band works. I definitely suggest getting one. It had made SUCH a difference in my running. I run anywhere from 3-10 miles every time I run. And will be ramping up my running soon. It was such a hassle not having something to fit my phone, I have the water bottles and energy / gu packets all perfectly placed in my waist belt. All I was missing was my phone holder! THANK YOUU!"
0,The screen protector is not anti-fingerprints
1,Everything I expected
-1,Good for the price but they stopped working after 2 weeks of use
0,"The connection is somewhat disappointing, a lot of static from time to time. But for the price, it is a good buy."
1,Wao is excelent i am writing from the phone. Thanks for everything.
-1,It didn't work waterproof seal didn't pass the test
1,fast shipping thankyou
1,I'm a huge harry potter fan so when I saw this case I had to have it. I've had zero issues with this case. I love it!
1,It works in my phone and the price was outstanding!!<br />The last one I had lasted almost 4 years with charging then just started to go dead....all the time.<br />I'll keep track with this one.....even if it only lasts a year??? The price makes up for it! Ha!
-1,This case does NOT fit the G4 with the leather back like the description claims. It doesn't wrap all the way to the front of the phone and somehow my phone got damage to the bottom edge while putting this case on. It's going back.
1,"Just got it and installed today for my 2009 Toyota Tacoma and it was very easy to install, works very good. Well recommend it  Worth the money.<br />Fast delivery.  Sam"
1,Is good unit. Loud speaker.
-1,After receiving the armband I could see automatically that it was not up to my expectations. it was made out of flimsly material. When you put your phone in it and tried to use key pad of your phone it was impossible. The plastic covering that part of the phone once again was junk! Too bad! You get what you pay for! To use the phone you have to take it out of the arm band. PAIN!
1,"Hi,<br /><br />This is my review of the product listed on Amazon as:<br /><br />IPhone Case, IPhone 6 Case - TURATA Premium Handmade Bling Crystal Diamonds Sweet Love Blowing Dandelion Brushed Metal Design Back Case Cover for IPhone 6 (4.7&#34;)(Value Package)<br /><br />I received this product a few weeks ago and had time yesterday to evaluate it for a detailed review.  I have also included several photos that I took of the cases and accessories in use for anyone who is interested.<br /><br />This is for all current colors: Red, Blue, Pink, Grey, and Gold<br /><br />UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:<br /><br />What’s great about this product from TURATA is that they do a really good job with the packaging.  I mean, really good.  I’ve had phone cases come in from other brands and all they give is a simple white box with their logo and the case inside.  Here, with TURATA, you get a pretty welcoming experience.<br /><br />First the box comes wrapped in a candy like wrapper package to make it feel like a gift.<br /><br />Upon opening that wrap, there’s the dark purple wavy design pattern on the gift box with the TURATA logo and website on the bottom of the top lid of the box.<br /><br />When you open up the lid, what you’ll find is behind the lid is a company message to the owner of the product edged in gold coloring with thanks and appreciation.  An e-mail address is provided.<br /><br />In the holding box, there’s the stainless steel stylus pen with rubber tip, a packaged dust plug, and a TURATA tan colored pouch that’s folded up to fit the box with the TURARA logo again.  Inside the pouch is where the phone case is located.<br /><br />So overall, with the packaging, I was impressed how delicate and premium it felt for them to spend so much time with the packaging and boxing to make it a great welcoming experience.<br /><br />I haven’t seen other brands do this with their cell phone cases when I get them delivered from Amazon.  So they get points for that.<br /><br />In looking at the stylus pen, I thought it looked nice at first.  It is smooth and comfortable to hold based on its curved design.  I tested the rubber tip on my phone and it was responsive and didn’t have much of any issues.  The problem I had that I didn’t like about the stylus pen was that it rolls around too easily.  If you put it on a glass table top surface, it’s going to keep rolling until it hits something to stop it on the table or it will fall off the table onto the ground with a lot of noise from impact.  I didn’t like this design too much.  What I suggest and prefer is if TURATA keeps a similar design of this, but adds a silicon layer coating over some part of this stylus pen to give it some resistance and friction to any table top surface that you put it on so that it will hold still.  Also, if this could include a clip on component to it to clip onto shirt pockets and other things, that would be great too.  Otherwise, just simply putting the current form of this stylus pen into your pocket will do, but will also cause the rubber tip to attract dust.<br />The dust plug has a nice design to it.  Both the phone case “Bling” and dust plug “Bling” are really Rhinestones.  And that makes sense because they can’t sell a $10 phone case with real diamonds or premium crystals.  Otherwise, they’d go out of business.  But these do look nice as is, not only for kids and teenagers, but for older women as well.  Because of the elegant styling of the dust plug and phone case design, I don’t recommend this for men.  This is purely intended for the female audience to enjoy.  So feel free to get this for your lady friends, cousin, niece, sister, aunt, mom, or grandma.<br /><br />Each dust plug has a different design to it.  They each have two larger crystals that complement the color of the case.  So Blue case will have blue crystals on the dust plug, and so forth.  It’s a good color matching pattern that is separate for each phone color case that you get from TURATA.  It’s good to take a picture of them when you get them to not lose track of which dust plug for which phone case it goes to.  Some dust plugs have a large Eiffel tower piece attached to it by itself.  Others have a long necklace type of design with smaller crystals looping around followed by a smaller Eiffel tower piece.  The plug is a plastic material, which I don’t like as much.  I would’ve liked seeing a more harder and firm gripping material when plugged into the audio port of your phone to keep it held in more easily and resist from tugging on it.  That’s what I provide as a suggestion.  Perhaps stainless steel would be good.<br /><br />The phone cases each have a nice artwork design etched onto the case.  The case is fairly rough the way it was printed, likely from a 3D printer.  When I feel around it with my fingers, I feel the white horizontal line patterns throughout the case, from the interior.  They won’t scratch up your phone, but it does feel sort of rough.<br /><br />The exterior of the phone case has a nice smooth polish and is reflective where you look at it from the source of light.  This is reflective even without having the light hit the rhinestones.  Some people like it.  That glossy look does bring the color and the etched design out more.<br /><br />The artwork is of a boy and girl with a love symbol floating on top of the girl near some large and small dandelions.  The color of the case that you get from TURARA has the color noticeable on the first half of the case towards the bottom.  It fades towards a transparent coating on the way up.  This is important to know because some phones have a colored backing already on them, such as gold, space grey, or silver, and depending on what color case that you get, some cases look better once installed on one colored phone, but the same can’t be said if you take those same case colors that you liked and installed it on another phone colored backing.<br /><br />So for my evaluation and review, I had with me my iPhone 6 Gold colored phone to compare between the 5 colors for that gold backing.  For the other iPhone 6 colors, I suggest trying to find someone else who may reviewed and showed photos of it.<br /><br />USAGE:<br /><br />Installing the case was simple  I just aimed at an angle to tuck in the corner with the rear camera lens in first to fit the hole carved out for it, then placed the rest of the phone down into the case and pushed in have a snapping sound.  The case is flexible and bendable along the edges, which makes it more easy to install and not that difficult to remove.  To remove the case, I recommend going from the bottom corner of the case and aim at the corner to pry with your fingers while putting grip with your other finder into the power port of your iPhone.  Then continue to pull along that same side, which will detach the phone from the top corner and then the rest will come off.<br /><br />Each colored case, I installed it and took photos of how it looked indoors with certain levels of lighting coming in compared to going outdoors.  These photos were taken between 1pm to 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon, when the sun had come out.<br /><br />I’m going to go through each color and give my opinion and ranking.<br /><br />Blue case:<br /><br />When taking the blue case out of the yellow pouch, I thought to myself that this blue is a little too light of a color to fit in well with a gold background, even when looking at the pouch that was a tanned color rather than a gold color of my iPhone 6.  It doesn’t stand out due to the light Teal color.  I would’ve suggested a darker blue to have a good level of contrast between that and other colors.  And maybe it’s because of the gold.  If it was space grey or silver for the iPhone 6, maybe it would look better?<br /><br />When putting it into my hand, the edges of the bottom half of the case could be seen well with the Teal blue color.  The center of thebottom region of the case has a higher transparent mesh of the teal and the color of my hand behind it.<br /><br />When installing the iPhone 6 case onto it with the dust plug, it gave it a more light transition of blue into the gold backing of the phone.  The color had a more washed out soft touch looking appearance towards the bottom half below the large dandelion.  With indoor lighting, this looked sort of OK.  But I saw more clearly in the transparency than the blue that I think people would want to buy the case for.  The edges were more vivid in the teal color blue.  Up close, you can see the white etched streak marks across every part of the phone case.  I’m not sure if that’s by design or not.  The dust plug does look nice with this colored case.<br /><br />When taking it outdoors into the bright sunlight, the blue that could be seen did not look really good with this gold backing.  There just wasn’t enough of the color there to really want to stand out well.  The soft touch may look OK within an indoors setting, but outdoors in the sunlight, it doesn’t look good.  In the outdoor shade, it has an OK look with the soft touch of the blue focused more on the boy and girl etched image.<br /><br />I wouldn’t recommend this case for the gold backing of the iPhone 6.<br /><br />Grey case:<br /><br />The grey case has a darker tone to it under the tan colored pouch.  When raising the case up with my hand, it has a more classical drawn and illustrated look to it.  The gray you could see well from the pouch and holding it up with your hand.  However, when you install it on the phone with a gold colored backing, it has a different look of positive or negative depending on which angle you’re holding it.  In the indoor lighting, holding it at certain angles with the reflection of the lighting hitting it didn’t make the gray stand out enough to look good.  When I avoided some of the glaring reflection indoors, the gray color looked better for the etched design around the boy and girl.  It did give the overall look from gold on top to gray on the bottom a strange look.  I’d say you’d get more looks with this colored case indoors than the blue one that I looked at earlier.<br /><br />In the outdoor shade, the colored case didn’t look too well from how I saw it through the photo.  However, in direct sunlight, it looked a little better.<br /><br />Overall, I’d rank the grey case better than the blue case, for a gold colored iPhone 6<br /><br />Red case:<br /><br />The red case from TURATA when looking at it for the first time had a nice look to it.  It’s like a more champagne red color.  It had a more deep tone in the color than the other colored cases observed.  And while I was evaluating this, I found it looked better with the thicker depth of the color onto the case.<br /><br />When installing this case on the gold backing of an iPhone 6, this looked really nice in the indoor lighting setting.  The gold that goes through the white streaked transparency of the phone case on top has a nice looking transition at the center as it goes into the red coloring towards the bottom.  It actually complements the artwork very well, with the love or affection in the red and the dimmer gold tone for the brightness of a sky appearance on the case.<br /><br />In the outdoor shade, the red stood out well with the gold that dimmers a little and had a nice overall experience.  Even in bright direct sunlight it had a nice look to it where the red darkened out well.<br /><br />I like this colored case for this iPhone 6 gold backing and I would recommend it.<br /><br />So far, I’d rank them as the following:<br /><br />1) Red<br />2) Grey<br />3) Blue<br /><br />Gold case:<br /><br />The gold colored case in front of the tanned colored pouch made it hard to see much of any difference.  Holding it with my hand made the gold look so washed out and transparent that I saw more of the white streak lines more than anything.<br /><br />However, when installing it onto my iPhone 6 case, the gold on the case was slightly more noticeable because it was darker in the bottom half than the top half, which had the gold backing of the iPhone seen through it.  It has a very smooth transition and because it’s gold on gold of different coated layers, it’s almost better than a clear case, but hard to tell from clear case, if you know what I mean.  In the indoor lighting, I could see the dark to lighter gold transition more easily.<br /><br />However, outdoors, in the shade for example, I wasn’t able to tell the gold color of the casing at all.  In the bright sunlight, the darker shade of gold on the case was barely noticeable.  I think this sort of faded, hard to tell look, reminded me the same way when I evaluated the blue colored case.  I didn’t like neither of them because what is the purpose of buying a colored case when you can barely see it in the light?<br /><br />So to rank these again, I’d put the gold better than the blue just because of a nice looking transition in the indoor lighting, but I wouldn’t recommend it for the gold colored backing of the case.<br /><br />Ranking:<br /><br />1) Red<br />2) Gray<br />3) Gold<br />4) Blue<br /><br />The last color for the evaluation is:<br /><br />Pink:<br /><br />The pink color had a washed out look to it that is a mixed feeling between the blue case and the gold case.  It’s not clearly visible even while in front of the tannish colored pouch.  In my hand, it wasn’t as clearly visible with the pink.  It was a very light touch of a coating onto the case.  When installing it on the Gold iPhone, it had a very light touch and transition from how light the gold looks on the top and towards the bottom, the light and dim tone of the pink.  It doesn’t really stand out at all, and if that’s your intention is to give it a color mixture that doesn’t stand out a lot, then this case is for you.  Oddly, the way that you hold the angle of the iPhone with this case installed, the pink can come out a little more vivid than when you’re looking straight into it with some glare from the polish the case has.<br /><br />Outdoors in the shade, the pink was faded and had a dull look to it.  This was the same observance in direct sunlight.  In direct sunlight, you can see the mild transition from pink to gold, but it’s a very light touch.  Personally for me, I like colors that stand out, so it’s a user preference.<br /><br />I would not recommend this color for a gold backing iPhone 6.<br /><br />So after evaluating the colors available, I rank them as follows:<br /><br />1) Red<br />2) Grey<br />3) Pink<br />4) Gold<br />5) Blue<br /><br />What’s good to know about these cases is that they have cutout holes for all buttons on the iPhone 6, including the volume buttons, sleep wake button, and the silence button.<br /><br />What’s missing that I suggest TURATA improves upon is adding depth in the front so that if the phone were to fall and land face first, then it would be very critical to avoid damage if the case could absorb the impact.  Having the front of the case curve out in the front and add up to 1/8th of an inch of thickness all around would help.  Otherwise, users will need to buy a tempered glass screen protector to protect the front of their iPhone because this current design case does not offer that protection.<br /><br />IN SUMMARY:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1) Premium gift wrapped packaging<br />2) Pretty artwork etched in that has a nice look and feel<br />3) Smooth exterior with added gloss that makes it looks and feels nice<br />4) Rhinestones offer a gleaming shimmer effect under the sun<br />5) Wide selection of colored cases to tailor for different colored phones<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1) Stylus Pen rolls around too easily uncontrollably on smooth surfaces<br />2) Case does not protect the front of the phone from drops and impacts<br />3) Some colors have a faded dull appearance whentaken outdoors or under certain reflective indoor lighting that does not look good for the iPhone color backing<br /><br />SUGGESTIONS:<br /><br />1) Redesign the side of the TURATA case mold so that wraps over to the front side and adds from depth of coverage.  About 1/8th inch should be sufficient all around the front edges<br />2) Provide a silicon portion on at least one portion of the stylus end or handle to provide more friction and act as a stopper from rolling around on smooth tabletop surface<br />3) Replace the plastic molding for the dust plug with a stronger alternative that holds better<br /><br />USAGE:<br /><br />This product would be good for people who:<br /><br />1) Want to have a flashy design for a cell phone case<br />2) Are in relationships<br />3) Want to present this as a gift to a lady for friendship or relationship matters<br />4) Want an attractive case that symbolizes who they are and what they’re about<br /><br />Overall, I think these cases are nice for women of all ages.  Couples can pair themselves with these cases as well, but it appears the etching and bling is more for the feminine side.  I was blown away by the packaging material after having gone through so many previous phone case orders with other brands and seeing how the boxing and wrapping was meant to be discarded right away.<br /><br />These case selections for your phone should be considered based on the type of iPhone you have because each of them have one of three different colored backings with will make the overall selection and preference from each other different in the overall look and appeal.<br /><br />I received samples of this product from the manufacturer to help give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.  This review is to also help with prospective buyers make smart, informed decisions based on the information available to them.<br /><br />I hope my photos were helpful.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.gn around the boy and girl.

1,Good
1,"These r great. I use in gym, and they have never fallen out.  I would recommend them to anyone and would definitely purchase them again."
1,This is an amazing charger it charges my device quickly but the wall adapter offen get really hot at times
1,"It's CHeap! so, don't expect it to last long."
1,"Very pretty, strap not made well"
1,I am very pleased with the Pyle 7500 Car Backup Camera.  The large screen with the distance scale lines make backing up very easy.  I wish I had purchased it sooner!
1,Ordered this to use for a backup charger to throw in my bag. Like that you can swap USB cords. Shipping was good especially as it's coming from China. Had it for about s month and is working great.
1,I gotta say love the camouflage design as well as protecting my phone
-1,It's OK ... larger than I'd like.  Belt clip falls off occasionally ... haven't tried the armband.  When it stops working I'll buy something different.
1,Functions as advertised.
0,Ok product. Thought it would be  a better  quality
0,"I loved it, worked perfect, untill the day it completely fell apart. So if you only need it for a few months, get it, but dont expect it to last."
-1,I had my phone for less than a week before the screen cracked. The phone does not have enough screen protection with this case. I would highly recommend spending the extra money on stronger case
1,BUY THIS PRODUCT NOW. You won't have to pay the $150 or whatever for the apple version of the stainless steel. This is so much better and so much cheaper. Now the product being cheaper doesnt mean it's cheaper quality. The quality is excellent!
1,headset has excellent sound quality with many features such as the stealth feature which activates noise cancellation to queltch the noise from extreme wind.
1,The best.
1,great deal! probably best to bring inside off season.
1,Good
1,not working now.. not sure where the issue is though.
1,"Love the iPhone 6 plus, this IPhone 6 Plus Belt Clip Holster case makes it too large to fit in my shirt pocket. (a convenience for me) I did use the belt holster for the Defender. So, I decided to sacrifice the protection for convenience and traded the cases for a more slim protective case and glass screen protector. Also love the High quality Faux-Leather pouch,Soft interior prevent scratches.

1,"Fits great, protects the phone great.  Only down side is some ear phone jacks don't fit through the case and require the case to be removed to operate."
1,good except i wieh it had magnetic latch as some do
-1,"I now realize purchasing an item from iBOLT was a mistake. First, the short cable on the back of the mount would not stay locked into place. Also, the included USB cables charge VERY slow, since they only charge at .5 amps. Next I noticed the little rubber pads that secure the phone fall apart every time you mount and unmount the phone. The final straw was when the little ball that holds the phone mount to the arm snapped off. Now it is unusable. Save your money and purchase a quality product from another company."
1,"Amazing sound - not very comfortable, I'm not used to these type of earphones so I'm going to have to give it more time. The sound is awesome! Super deep bass, earphones itself feels sturdy. Not a big fan of long cord going around the back of my neck, using the cord holder makes it even more uncomfortable (it tugs the earphones back) and not using it makes the left earphones cable jump forward. I ran for an hour and a half (on a treadmill) the first day I got it and went to work, charged it for about 2-3 hours and got about 4 hours of use, I hear you can get up to 6-8 continuous hours use out of it - overall I'm very happy with the earphones and price."
0,does not hold charge well
1,"Nice. Would recommend getting a case or cover to go over the backing. The backing it comes with is not very durable. Even if you drop it on carpet or something soft, it will automatically come off and battery will fly out as well."
1,I highly recommend reviewing the youtube video prior to installation and prep work and thorough cleaning is the key to perfection.  This was my first time ever doing this and my application went ever better than the one shown in the video. It adhered completely to every edge without a single bubble...amazing!  I would definitely recommend this screen protector and will be buying the smartphone version soon since the current one I have was installed by a &#34;professional&#34; who didn't take the time to clean properly.
-1,It stopped working a week after unpacking this cable. Terrible quality. Didn't expect this from Tech Armor
1,This thing is adorable! Although maybe make it a little more bulky so it can be protective.
1,Perfect. Just like the one I paid $30 at the T-Mobile store - just less expensive
1,Good
1,Very nice!
1,"Just got this in the mail and am excited to say it perfectly connects my docking station in my Toyota to my Galaxy s5 phone. The loudest volume setting is just a little lower than my normal speakers with just the radio on, but I can play my music now so that's a super minor issue."
1,"A Really good product for the best price, just can't beat Plantronics and Amazon Prime!!!"
1,Good quality
-1,"I'll admit, it looks very nice. It's also very thin, light and doesn't offer much protection. The bumper doesn't go all the way around the phone. The top and bottom edges are open and completely expose the phone. I returned this and purchased a case by Carved of equal price, but much better protection and it's made in the USA. It's made from quality wood and designed to keep the phone safe as well as look beautiful.<br /><br />Check out http://www.amazon.com/CARVED-Cedar-iPhone-Traveler-Case/dp/B00R55SEGA/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1440947528&sr=1-1&keywords=carved+iphone+6+case"
-1,Didn't work that well
1,Good product
1,It is working perfect.
1,;)
1,"Works great! This screen protector has saved my phone multiple times, I love it!<br />I've bought two and will be buying more in the future (I tend to have butter-fingers!)"
1,it works fine and was a great price
1,"if you dont allready know, you should never buy apple lightning cables, and if your apple cable hasn't broken yet, it will.  this three pack of cables gets the job done without requiring you being gentle with them.<br />pros:  fits in iphone 5/5s Fre lifeproof case (not sure about iphone 6)<br />durable enough (travel with it, bend it,)<br />charges my ipad air 2 at 2.4 amps (unlike my defective apple cable)<br />28/3= $9 per cable: great deal (apple's are $20)<br /><br />cons: lightning end is a little bigger than the apple cable so i dont think it will fit in every waterproof case (the cheaper ones) but it will fit in the expensive iphone 5 lifeproof cases and im pretty sure otterbox too<br /><br />i did get this product for free because there were no reviews on it at the time, and they needed reviews on a new product, however they did NOT ask for a positive review, i felt it deserved it so my review is not biased"
1,Makes my husband feel like he's a luxury car when he's cruising around in his 98 blazer. ha ha ha ha
1,"I barely had my Vivofit 2 for a week and it popped off somewhere. So it is lost. I thought it did a decent job as an activity tracker and I was getting back on an exercise and calorie counting regimen, but the clasp did not hold up to rugged work. I am positive it was locked in, but must have popped loose when I was hauling logs. Very disappointed that lost it that quickly. Onward..."
-1,"UPDATE:  The reply to my original review implied that I could contact customer service for a remedy. I did. And not only was the respondant seemingly unable or unwilling to look up my order or review on their end, but after sending several polite emails with all of the necessary information for them, I've apparently been blown off. Glad ya'll wasted my time with your sh!t warranty. I woulda changed this from 2 stars to 0, but I'm stuck giving 1. Was great when it functioned. Purchased mid-June. Battery is now totally dead. Won't charge or power phone. Thankfully, still had my old one."
1,"Love anchors, so naturally I love this"
1,Great product as always i have bought these for all my phones super fast shipping and they work as they should just make sure when you install it clean area and surface and you will be fine and they fit perfect thank you
1,Attractive and protects my iPad mini well.
-1,These did not work. No instructions and no power cord to charge it.
1,"well made, quality product"
1,"My son loves it, uses with IPhone 6"
1,I used this charger right after it arrived on a trip and I was really impressed with how well it charged my Android phone. My phone went completey dead 2 times and this device fully recarged it both times. I do not know how much was left on the charer. I would recomend this to buy.
0,Good !!
1,A must if you are working.  I have a lot of moving things around the yard. And kept losing my phone.  This keeps the phone clipped on to be in tact. Great buy
1,These are great ear phones. The only lack a clip so they will not slide from around your neck.
1,"love the fish eye lens, not so much the wide angle/focus lens. can't use the focus lens alone as it needs the wide angle lens attachment. feels like it is well made."
-1,None of these 4 cables worked on my phones.
1,Seems sturdy enough. Comes with screen protector that is ok. Not too bulky. Can make it difficult to fit most ear phone Jacks.
1,grandson loved it
1,Love these! Great price and I change them up all the time
-1,"great at first,  then I noticed one of the sides was becoming loose,  so theres a noticable gap between the soft case and the hard poly carb shell."
1,Took a few tries to get the ear pieces properly fitted.<br />A bit of a thump thump as you run.  Not too overbearing though.
1,Very cute ! love it
1,Love it
0,I do like this case.  It definitely keeps with my &#34;stormtrooper&#34; motif I have on my Iphone (white/black).  It fits well and generally allows good access to the various buttons.  The ringer/silence switch is an exception - it's hard to get my fat fingers into that tiny little slot they've left open.<br /><br />One critical note:  My iPhone 6+ was dropped on a bathroom floor from about 3 feet up.  It hit the top right corner.  This case did *not* protect the iPhone. My screen has a little bit of damage right in that corner that I'd hoped would've been prevented by this case.
1,really worth of the money.
-1,Had the phone for 30 days and it died just one day stopped working... And the top button was broken.. Waste of fifty bucks
1,Exactly what I was looking for!
-1,"I loved these,  they worked great for workouts;  them just after the 30 day return window closed on August 18th, they no longer turn on.  When plugged in,  they show full charge but they will no longer turn on.  This sucks  :-("
1,3 Months later and it's dead. Just quit working. And since it has been more than 30 days I can't return or even exchange it. Horrible. Do not buy.  **EDIT** Soon after I left a one star review the company reached out to me. They have sent me a new portable charger at no cost. I changed the rating on the review based on the the level of customer service.  Very excellent customer service. Hopefully this charger lasts longer than 3 months!
1,Display is the same as original from my Moto x. Very pleased with this purchase. Image is same. Responsiveness is the same. Color and brightness is the same. Installed easily with video from fixez.
1,Good quality....clear picture......Happy child!
1,Does a great job.  Charges the phone quickly.  Much better than the generic thing you'd find at a drug store.
1,Handy....nice you can put a couple of cards along with your ID in it
1,Worked so well I bought another.
1,"I was one of the first to preorder this product.  As an avid TCDS believer and user, I had been looking for something small and discrete that I can bring to the office and not worry about the million stares I'd get from wearing one of the &#34;other&#34; similar devices.<br /><br />The vibes work great.  As someone else notes, the effects are a bit subtle, but I prefer subtle than the jittery effects I get from the normal stimulants.  I'm the kind of person who gets all weird when I drink too much coffee and folks notice it.  The stimulant effect here is clear in that I'm level headed and can express my thoughts without the fog.<br /><br />The calming vibes I think has pretty much cured my insomnia so that alone makes it worth every penny.<br /><br />Folks who are looking for a &#34;high&#34; or &#34;low&#34; I think is barking up the wrong tree.  The intent I think is to enhance your mood not be so invasive that others notice.  But of course that's my opinion.  Thanks for the great product!"
0,"Loved the look and the quality felt great. And i got tons of compliments on it !<br /><br />But after a month stones around the edges started falling off.  Just one at first and then it started snagging things.  And then more fell off and then it was snagging on everything.  Finally my daughter had my phone and poked her finger on a now sharp piece of metal and this case had to go.<br /><br />This would be great for only occasional use, but not everyday. It just doesn't hold up. Which is sad because it is really pretty!"
-1,"Very burkly and can't waterproof,DON'T BUY IT"
1,"Cobra's iconic 148 GTL took a slight redesign in the phase-locked loop system back in 2008 utilizing a Chinese produced chip . The radio out-of-the-box is acceptable, performance is a bit low but with a few tweaks to make it a relatively good, loud CB radio. Out-of-the-box, most of these radios are 200 to 300 Hz frequency, perfectly acceptable under FCC standards but by resetting to dead center on all bands radio audio quality on the receiving end really pops as it stands out. If you're wishing to add an echo board to the radio, do not use the turbo echo board products as they have a tendency to growl and continuously reverberate unnecessarily in deep echo. I would also suggest that you purchase as an option a 12 gauge 3 pin power plug for Cobra but only change the fuse out to one more amp if the radio has been properly performance tuned, as the additional current draw in SSB will cause a warble when using single side band with the original power cord. In a.m. mode with out the upgraded power cord , the TX modulation tiends to peak negative on an oscilloscope as the unit is virtually power starved at 95% modulation with the original power cord. An indication of being power starved is if the meter lights dim when you're talking, it is because it is not getting enough current to operate efficiently. Also, if this radio is modified for additional frequencies you will find that it is somewhat less stable than the..... older 148 GTL's"
-1,They stopped working the first day I got them even after I charged them they still wouldn't work
1,Great
1,Nice case
-1,Gets extremely dirty VERY quickly and won't clean even after scrubbing. The buttons on the side broke off and the paint is chipping. Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it has protected my phone when I dropped it!
1,Very good product
1,well worth the cost.  difficult to see/feel the button icons in the darkness of the early morning.
1,No comments
-1,"Broke the first day I had it just from putting it in my pocket. I didn't expect much for the price, but I expected it to last longer than a day."
1,"Excellent Day time recording, true Full HD recording, Not very Good in Night time though it produce high noise picture<br /><br />The time Lapse option is quite Good and does a very good job"
1,"Works well. Viewing angle could be better...  but for the cost, great monitor!"
1,After having these for a year. They work the same then as they do now. I got two and wired them for 2 ohm. Oh also got a ported box sounds much bigger than they are.
1,Holding up will.
1,Great will do business again
-1,This is a rip off from the Steelie [...]. Don't be fooled. Cheap and junk. Order the real thing instead.
1,I love this phone  it came in excellent condition as I expected.
1,100% awesomeness
1,I love it
1,Perfect n came fast in mail
-1,This cord is already broken.
1,Good deal
1,Wish they came in different colors but I love it!
1,I play a lot of golf and I really like the Approach S3. Courses are easily recognized and the convenience of having it on my wrist  is great. I previously was a user of Sky Caddie. This is much better in my opinion.
-1,Never saw any liquid but somehow it leaked. I never dropped it and no cracks????? Idk. Cute for a week
1,Better than the Motorola originals that broke in a week.
1,Absolutely the best iPhone charging/data cable out there. It's durable and better quality than the original Apple cable that comes with the phone/iPod. I got the 6ft one and it's perfect for use in bed or connecting a docking station to your computer.
1,"My only suggestion to the manufacturer is that the support arm also have an up/down adjustment to accommodate cars with slanted dash boards (civics, etc.)"
1,great product and smaller than expected so it worked great!
1,Will be buying other colors!
1,"I love this solar charger. Not only is it very useful but it is super cool. It is well made, thick and sturdy. Everyone wants to know about it and how it works. "
1,"I purchased this case for my daughter for her birthday to go along with her new ipod.  She likes blue, so I figured with the blue silicone part and the pretty floral design, she would be happy.  This case is really pretty in person.  I love the design of the floral hard shell.  Unfortunately it is super hard to get on the ipod, well not hard to put on, but hard to make it look right.  The silicone part gets kind of squished up in parts so it doesn't look totally smooth and even like you would want.  We did get it, but it took several tries.  After about a month, my daughter dropped her ipod and the outer shell case cracked as well.  So, for actual protection of the ipod, it has done a good job because the silicone part really cushions falls.  But the case does not necessarily stand up to abuse - it is a very crackable plastic.  Very pretty, but I think next time I will go with something a little more sturdy.  I do really love the silicone liner, I just wish it was easier to get it smoothed on."
1,Perfect product. Just what I needed
1,Yes
1,It's cute and does what it need to do
0,"I really liked it, but I ordered purple. What arrived was a redish/pink.  Not the color I ordered at all."
-1,Unfortunately this battery did not wake my ipod back up like I had hoped.  Not sure if it was the battery's fault or if something else was wrong with the ipod.  My ipod keeps saying the battery is low so I thought changing it out would make it start working again...  Bummed out.  I ended up sending the battery back for  a refund--no problem with the return.
1,"The case and the holder are outstanding. Everything has worked out as advertised.<br />I am very satisfied with the service, as I received it two days, after I ordered it."
1,"This phone=Amazing!!<br />I am a huge android fan and have used so many phones. From the notes, to the motos and other budget friendly devices. This device simplifies things such as hardware but takes no short cuts to create a balanced priced phone for the manufacturer. I am amazed at how Mich bang you get for your buck here.<br />To combat common complaints I would say: I got this phone not to long ago. it does have &#34;bloatware&#34; however between having 4 gbs of RAM , a convenient clear cache button in the notification shade and the auto start app manager, my phone is always snappy. Sure there are a lot of preloaded apps. Root and uninstall the ones you want to. However, 64 GB and expandable storage being an option these apps make little difference in performance or memory.<br />The camera is good enough. It is a mobile smartphone camera. People expect to much in this category. All photos look blurry until you tap the screen to focus in on what it is your taking a picture of. HDR mode is freaking amazing. They have a sleep of filters and optimizations depending on what kind of photo your taking or scene your in.<br />Battery life is good. I have no problem with my unit. It takes 4 hours of on screen usage to kill it but it will easily last all day with moderate usage. When you do use it heavily and drain it the quich charger will have you back at it in no time.<br />The UI (look of the software) I have mixed feelings about. The folder organization for all apps I don't find useful. But as a disclaimer I am used to a stock app drawer experience. Alphabetically ordered. Double tap the screen while off to wake up is awesome and convenient since the lock screen button is all the way on the top of the device. You can draw a C while the screen is off to auto launch the camera or even double tap volume up. This makes it easy to access the camera when your trying to capture something quickly. Especially handy if you have kid. I put a third party launcher on my device because I am not a huge fan of the look of the default one. The notification shade is a bit much but with some theme options you can improve it somewhat.<br />The screen is nice and you can manually change the balance and color saturation. In my opinion all devices should have this because color temperature us off on a lot of phones out there. This has a realistic color saturation but for someone like me who prefers saturated displays just switch it to vivid mode in the display settings.<br />The only thing I can find I do not like about this phone is the hardware keys are not back lit. This however is not a big deal.<br /><br />Conclusion is if your looking at this phone, then buy it. Best bang for your buck period.  It has many flagship features. The four gigs of RAM are a welcome sight to power users and I feel like a cool guy having an Intel in my phone. The cameras are great with many great manual features. The volume rocker on the back I have lived ever since LG did it and it makes a slight difference I welcome. Battery life is good and the included fast charger just makes the battery experience terrific. The 64 GB memory is enough plus you have expandable storage. I have 5 games over 2 gbs on it, all my music downloaded, all my podcasts, and all my books and a hundred plus apps and have only touch 20 of the GB. I have a lot of stuff on here.<br />GET THIS PHONE!!!"
1,Very good! Works as expected. This was the only charger that worked for my LG G2 after the original charger shorted out.
1,"This is a really useful gadget, but it needs instructions. The most important thing to remember with it is that the cover must be open for the battery inside to charge."
1,Great clear case. Came in looking brand new. Ive ordered cases on Amazon​ before and they were used but I bought them brand new. This one delivers and I highly recommend.
1,"The Shower mate works well inside and out of the shower. Its very loud in the shower and the sound quality is better than a phone, but not quite as good as a stereo bluetooth speaker. The suction cup is strong, and sticks to many surfaces except except drywall and my cat. The connectivity range is incredible, lasting up to 110 feet outside. Battery life is about 6 hours playback, and recharges in 2. My only concern is the charging cable is not a standard micro USB, so don't lose it! Some people have reported not being able to change the volume or turn it off, but I didnt have this problem, the buttons are multifunctional.<br /><br />▌ SOUND QUALITY ▌<br />It gets more than loud enough in the shower because in there it is amplified, and actually hurts to have it maxed out. I found about 3/4 volume was good.<br />Sound quality is ok. There is moderate distortion above 3/4 volume, particularly in the bass-mids.<br />Using a tone generator, I can get whisper quiet bass as low as 40hz, but in music it's only relevant above 75hz. There is not much bass below 100hz as you should expect from this size of speaker. Deep basslines are barely there, but standard electronic basslines, and acoustic guitars are fine.<br />The mids, highs, and vocals sound good, except in the shower vocals become a little distorted from the echo off the walls. I found puting the speaker in the middle of a wall was better than in the corner.<br />It's fine for music outside the shower to, probably even more so. All that being said, the audio and frequency range is still better than from a phone, tablet, or small notebook, but not quiet as good as a standard portable stereo bluetooth speaker. It is still enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />Call quality is fine, but nothing special. I can clearly hear other people, and they can hear me, but my voice is a bit distorted if I talk to loud or close to the mic (tested with recording on computer). It's not like a phone mic where you need to be close, it picks up voice from a few feet away, but at the same time it does a decent job of dampening the shower noise.<br /><br />▌ BUILD / DESIGN ▌<br />The rounded shape is easy to hold in hand. It's made out of plastic with a rubber texture. The buttons are soft silicone and have a clicky feedback. They are positioned far enough apart and have a bit of mushy space between them so I know which one I'm touching without looking. The suction cup is strong and hasnt fallen off, but it is also easy to pull off and reposition if desired, and sticks to many surfaces. It also floats in water. I opened it up and it is sealed with a rubber O-ring.<br /><br />▌ FUNCTION & CONNECTIVITY ▌<br />The speaker has several controls such as Power, Skip back / Volume down, Skip foreward / Volume up, Pause / Play, and Call / Reject / Redial. So there is no need to be near the phone once you have the playlist or app setup. It also can skip stations on internet radio apps. The only thing I didnt like about the controls was how slow it is to change the volume, it is not changed in increments, you must hold down the button to gradually change it and it takes 13 seconds to go from 0-100%. Not a big deal, but annoying if something plays to loud and you need to turn it down fast.<br /><br />The connectivity remained up to 110ft outside, and was fine anywhere in my house.<br /><br />Battery life lasts 6 hours, and recharges in about 2 hours. It's a 400mAh 3.7V battery. The charging cable is sadly not micro USB, and isnt like any other cable I have, it's like a tiny version of a 3.5mm audio hack, so I would be worried about losing it.<br /><br />There is an LED under the rubber that shines through and show different statuses. It flashes blue ever few seconds so you know it's on. It flashes pink and blue when turning it off. While charging it is solid red, and shuts off when finished.<br /><br />▌ CONCLUSION ▌<br />The showermate is a nice speaker, even outside the shower (maybe even more so). It is more than loud enough and the mic picks up voice from a few feet away. It has a couple minor annoyances like the slow volume change and non-micro USB cable, but overall is good for the price. I give it 4.5 stars because of the uncommon charging cable. Sample provided for testing and review.<br /><br />Specs:<br />Supports: A2DP/AVRCP<br />Input: DC 5V 100~120mA<br />Battery: 3.7V 400mAh Lithium<br />Charging Time: Approx 3 hours<br />Operating Time:Approx 6 hours<br />IP Grade: IPx4<br />Material: Silicone + ABS Plastic<br />Operational Distance: Approx 30 Feet<br />Dimensions: 3.35&#34; x 3.35 x 1.78 Inches<br />Buttons: On/Off, Play/Pause, Previous Track/Volume Down, Next Track/Volume Up, Phone Pick up/Hang up.

1,"Nice and compact and works as described. Only used three items at once so far, but no problems."
1,Love having protection for my cell phone screen.  Easy to install and clean
-1,These worked fine at first but after using them for a couple of days they stopped working. Not worth the money savings.
1,Excellent
-1,"Battery was alright for two weeks, then quickly dropped charge.  Now useless."
1,Worked out perfect.
1,"Perfect Product, Best price!"
-1,I received two bags and both were defective.
-1,Should have paid attention to the poor reviews. The cable works. Elsewhere. The iPhone 6 rejected the charger. I bought an Apple charger instead. Apple is more proprietary than Microsoft ever thought of being back in the old days when Apple was complaining about it.
1,I needed an iPhone mount that would work with multiple sizes of iPhones and that would make it easy to reach my phone. This mount is great quality and very adjustable so you can really put it just about anywhere. Definitely would recommend
0,"The fine-point stylus is not as sensitive as I would like.  I find that I have to hold it in a specific position in order for it to work.  This may be caused by the screen cover I have on my iPad, but I would prefer that the stylus worked with the screen cover instead of having to remove it to achieve maximum functionality."
1,This fits my need perfectly.  I like they sideways ease of use and the clip for the belt is very well made and should last.
1,good one
1,This is a great little case
0,It's not to bad:)
1,I love it.
1,Perfect. Magnet is good and can hold samsung s5 and iphone 6.
-1,my mistake for choosing this product. I did not realize that it is intended for pilots and yacht owners. I hike and bike and this device is not optimized for this. It did  not last even a week.
1,"I really enjoyed these headphones they looked very retro which I liked. A lot of headphones now days look very high-tech  and even though these do not support Bluetooth I would still buy these so I could jam out in style.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very Sleek<br />-Threaded cable<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Its not the big over the ear headphones its actually one of those on the ear headphones<br /><br />Overall:<br />Amazing Sound and very stylish as expected. Plus, the headphones are limited edition so get yours before these run out definitely a great steal for the price.<br /><br />Promotion Disclaimer:<br />I received this product during a promotional period in exchange for a unbiased review."
1,Love it 😍😍😍😍
1,great buy super fast shipping a+++
0,"seems to work just fine with android tablets and phones. paired fine with my usb bt enabled win 7 pc , but that's about lt' nothing works; returning it for a refund."
1,Love it!!
1,Very good quality item. Easy to use and at a good price. I would recomendamos this selfie stick to anyone that's looking for an easy to use good quality product.
1,I stayed in NYC for little more than a month and for this purpose the card worked very well. The activation procedure was precisely described and everything worked as it was supposed to work.<br />When I go next time I would buy this card again if it is still available.
1,very nice case in a good price. Can't go wrong with anker products. Premium quality and slim design.
1,I've had this in my car for a while now. Loving it so far. working great plus a sleek design as well.
1,Got it for my daughter and she loves it!
0,it was nice of them to give me my money back after a bad review!
1,It works!
1,Very good case but very heavy.
1,Looks great with the Space Gray iPhone 6. Love it!!!
1,"Still using it, i should buy 2 more as spares"
1,"Packaged great. These folks obviously sell these for a living. Good directions, pieces and parts included.<br /><br />If you are going to do this yourself, it's not a piece of cake but it's not space shuttle technology either.<br /><br />Here's an old wives tale. Once you set these protectors that's it. It better be right or you're sunk. That is BS.<br /><br />Keep the plastic backer that you removed from the sticky side. Place a piece of the backer across one corner of the phone face covering maybe a half inch of the corner. Set the protector. Should the protector fail to land squarely on the phone or other issues signal a fail like dust on the surface creating pimples, use the backer to lift the protector away from the phone with a gentle and even pull until enough is free that you can handle the protector with your fingers on the edges only. Realign and retry or, if the protector gets a dust particle stuck to the sticky side use the sticky tape that came with the protector for dabbing on the prone face to do the dabbing to the dust particle. Hey, what is the worst that can happen? You were going to junk it and buy another anyway so if these hints help it's a win win, if not no big deal.<br /><br />For the faint of heart, take your phone and this protector to your mobile providers storefront and they will do it for you."
1,It works perfectly well and the price was very reasonable. Nothing to nag about!
1,love this case....
1,Works great!
1,"This case is for my husband's iPhone 6 that has a slim case around it. His phone fits well inside it, and it's easy to get the phone out to answer a call.  The clip is sturdy and securely hooks around his 1 1/2&#34; belt.  He works outside most of the day and moves between different types of equipment, and a flimsy case would not work. We would definitely purchase another one if we needed it.  My husband had a little difficulty with the elastic coming out on one side after about ten months of rough daily use. I contacted Grantwood Technology, and they promptly replaced it. Fantastic customer service!"
0,Shipping was excellent but quality is not as good as expected.
1,"I like this unit.  Both cameras have good resolution during daytime use, both on the road as well as within the vehicle cabin.  The software is easy to operate. I save my daily trips to my computer.  I drive daily & I do not drive without it.  The GPS tracking also is very accurate.  The only negative I have with THIS unit is the visual during night driving.  I plan to purchase the unit with the IR Night Vision feature (see below).<br />Indigi® Dash Cam 2.7&#34; TFT LCD Dual Camera Lens Car DVR IR Night Vision GPS."
-1,Did not fit phone. Waste of money.
-1,It does not meet the specifications are not against fingerprinting
1,very cute
1,Easy to connect and comfortable to usa.<br />I highly recommend these LotFancy headphones.
1,"Would have given it a five, but the orange was just a slight shade off.. still like the product.."
0,ok
1,good
1,"I'm 32 and a mom of three...I.bought this for myself and I am not ashamed! :) It arrived 2 days before expected....awesome service!  I thought the color on the shield was going to be a little brighter, but I'm not disappointed...it still looks great and I'm loving it,"
1,Just what I was looking for ... thin & durable.
1,I love it
0,I have my case have had it for about a month and I half I like it it cute and looks great on my phone but I gave it three stars because I bought this case to protect my phone 😒i wouldn't call it protective it doesn't look like my phone is really protected at all also the pink part is starting to stretch and not fit the phone correctly and the pink rubber gets dinghy very fast if your looking for a case that's looks nice for the price but is not really protective this is it but don't forget you get what you paid for 😊
1,Exactly what I needed for work.
-1,"Installed this for a JL Audio 10w3v3 subwoofer, which is a listed applicatation. The diameter was just a smidge too large, but that smidge made it impossible to install cleanly.  I am currently nursing my sore thumb.  I finally had to cut it to make it fit.  It is in now, but took way to much aggravation.  The only thing I can say for it is this: &#34;What other option is there?&#34;"
1,decent.
-1,"Poor quality, only half the functions work at once, wouldn't charge and display HDMI at the same time. the connector bends when I plug it in to my phone and lay it on the table. DO NOT BUY."
-1,Overheated my phone about half the time. Turned my camera on several times and took pants or jacket pocket photos even though the cover was closed.
-1,it did not hold and stay attached to my phone...useless. had to send it back. i have an android maxx
1,Great speaker so far. Have had it about a month. I primarily use in the shower but makes a great everyday speaker. Sound quality is decent for the size and the price. Would and have recommended to others.
1,Great item
1,Love it!!! I take it everywhere I go!!!
1,"Love this. It does exactly what I want this type of thing to do, just basic activity and monitor my posture. I have been wearing it since I purchased it in August 2015 and enjoy receiving the reminders for posture and information on my goal achievement for steps and posture. I did not want an activity monitor to wear on my wrist. The Lumo Lift is very unobtrusive and I appreciate that it does not announce the fact that I am monitoring my posture or counting steps. The options for dressing it up are nice but I use the basic silver and black."
1,"Cheap, works great, does what it says it will."
1,"Excellent Product for the price, very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone!"
1,Nice
0,"Picture is a bit deceiving...skin is very cute, but you do not get anything for the front of your phone. Only comes with a sticker/skin for the back."
1,Great product.  Fast shipping.
1,"I can't believe it is actually glass, so thin and flexible. Almost can't tell the screen has a protector installed. Easy to center despite what others have said, Infact, this is easier any other protector I have used this far. If you have an apple watch. Get this!<br />It comes with 2 screen protectors, various application tools( anti dust stickers, microfiber cloth, anti scratch bubble removing squeegee) and most importantly a lifetime warranty!"
1,when i first ordered it i was alittle nervous because i didnt see anyone else in the reviews so i was wondering if it was bad or good but its AWESOME... Got here on time it took me some a couple of kinutes to put it on but its awesome 😆😆. And it didnt come broken
1,This temper glass seriously saved my phone . I work in the culinary worlds and I am up and down all day so occasionally my phone will fall because of it and the rush. It is the best especially if you don't like bulky cars as I do not. This is seriously the best it's defector a must have.
1,It is very nice I have used it a lot already. Took in a trip and used it more than once.<br />Only thing is that I have to put power to it to get total charge to unit.
1,Prefect replacement.
1,Very nice device. I'm actually buying another one.
1,Worth every penny and it is beautiful. Only thing that would make it better is to have more color choices.
0,"Not bad, a little hard to find a place to stick it without being in my view."
1,Excellent
-1,Did not properly fit the phone. Will be returning the item.
-1,"At best, a fair fit. Does not cover sides and bottom edges well at bezel. Buttons very hard to use. Warped at top of bezel. Would not buy again. Too many better choices for the money."
1,👍🏻
1,Its a good device for travller
1,"I received this as a free review sample. I've probably reviewed (and then donated) two dozen selfie sticks and after a while most start looking alike.<br /><br />This one has some subtle differences. First, the 3.5mm power jack is a feature that appeals to me. As long as your phone has power you can use this stick. I cannot overemphasize how nice it is to not worry about whether the stick is charged up or not.<br /><br />The second 'improvement' that I like on this one is the ribbed grip. Some selfie sticks have smooth grips that are difficult to hold when they are wet. That brings me to the fact that I have used this one in light rain with no issues.<br /><br />My Note 3 phone is firmly held by the gripping mechanism, so it can accommodate larger phones. There is still a little extra that indicates that it could also hold a Note 4 or 5, or an iPhone 6.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest the mirror feature does not excite me. I can see the value if you want to take selfies using your phone's main camera, but for me using the self-side is more than sufficient.<br /><br />Overall, the design is the same, common selfie stick with some nice improvements. For me the biggest one is the ability to power this stick from my phone instead of worrying about a separate charging cycle. You may not be that excited about that feature, but if you do this stick may be all you need."
1,"I've had this case for a year and a half now, and bought it because Otterbox, which I had on my old Blackberry, didn't make one for the Z30.<br />It's been great. Worth it."
1,"It looks like a nice band and I like the clasp design, but it didn't come with any directions telling how to adjust the length of the band, nor did it come with any pins to attach it to the watch.  I hope than I will be able to use it.  The vendor, Monoy,  has been extremely helpful, and proactive, in telling me how to adjust the band.  Since the band looks great, and I am impressed with the locking mechanism, I'm changing my rating to 5 stars."
1,I did a bit of research before purchasing this for my iPhone 6. Have used it for close to six months now and it is one of my favorite cell phone cases ever. It's relatively slim on the phone and provides it with a surprisingly large amount of protection. I also especially like how it is mostly transparent so you still can enjoy the cool looks of the iPhone. Easy to install or take off the phone too. No issues accessing any of the buttons or the charging port at all.
1,Everything you want in a case. Especially for a phone this size!
1,Works great for my iPhone 5S. Can't beat the price.
1,"Good case and served me well, however, it has essentially fallen apart after 11 months of use.<br /><br />not at all clear how to activate the &#34;lifetime&#34; warranty from amazon."
1,Just like apples
1,Just as good as the original battery. I always carry an extra battery with me and charge the three of them (these two plus the original) on rotation. It's an awesome feeling to go from 0% to 100% power in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />Just be ready for confused and jealous iphone users.
0,"I bought this case about 3 weeks ago and for the most part I'm happy with it.  The screen is clear and easy to use still. Power and volume buttons all work well through the case, but the switch for silencing the phone doesn't work. I found this out the hard way missing a few phone calls and had to take the case off, switch the sound on, then carefully put the case back on without switching it back to silent. When I want to silence the phone I just turn the volume all the way down.  One other issue I have is that my Amazon iPhone charger doesn't plug in through this case, so I have to use standard iPhone charger.  Annoying, but how would they know I was going to buy a 3rd party charger? Can't really fault them for that.<br /><br />Aside from those 2 work around stage case works well. I have submerged it completely and no signs of leakage. For that reason I'm keeping the case and continuing to use it to protect my phone."
0,Too fragile
1,Great sound for the price.
1,good one
1,Was very easy to install and it only took me 3min to put it all together! The packaging was great in very good condition and brand new! I'd recommend this to everyone!!
1,I have had one before and I like this product
1,Great case
1,Easy to assemble and mounts in seconds. Holds my iPad very securely
1,Great connections!
1,Better than the smaller Sirius radio.
1,"Great quality, looks just like the picture. Fits my phone just right. I have seen this quality case for three times the price. I highly recommend it."
1,"It works for my iPhone, iPad, and my android tablets. It's quite big and heavy (see the seller's picture - comparison to the iPhone), I was planning to carry it in my purse, but decide that it will be a bit too heavy). Mine cannot be charged to a 100%, 99% is the maximum that I can charge, although I did try to charge it before I even use it. The on/off button never works, so what's the point of having an on/off button? It comes with several adapter."
1,"Product arrived on time, EXTREMELY well protected.  Ok, the box was the size of a toaster filled with those air cushions surrounding a lens smaller than a quarter...<br /><br />Seller says its OEM, but it sure doesn't look like the one I pulled out.  The dimensions are dead on.. perfect fit.. just visually it looks different than the one my phone came with.  There were 0 instructions on how to install it.. Looks like you pull the old piece, put in the double sided tape stuff inside the new one, pull the protective film off the lens, stick it in place, and re-install.  Fit was perfect.  I can live with it not looking identical.  The tools that shipped with, not a single one of them was the right size for the screws, again, no worries as I already have the right tools.  The little plastic pry thing was useful, and the only thing I'll keep from what it shipped with.  Good price, would be nice if they just had an option to buy the silicon lens and the adhesive though."
1,Didn't quite fit but I used it for parts to make my phone camera work.
0,Hard to press the bottons but if you cut just underneath the button closest to the back it makes it so much better
1,Great product and seller!
1,Good product
1,Does the job.
0,Did not meet my full expectations the case holder was a bit challenging to get on and I though it would have had a more rubbery thickness to it.
1,"Works Like A Charm!! As soon as I received my Multi Port Charger, I started charging 5 Batter Packs.  I measured the Voltage and the Amperage of each port.  All were where they should be.  There was no drop between using just 1 port, and using 5 ports.  There was no abnormal heat buildup in the Charger, as I thought there might be.  If you have multiple devices that need charging, then this is a MUST HAVE for you."
-1,Broke before I even got on my cell. Was wiping away finger prints and it snapped and cracked. Not worth the wait or even 10 cents.
1,great
1,Good
-1,It had more scratches on the back then what I expected!
1,Worked as expected.
0,I really like this case just the color on the front fades easy
1,Great product! But I lost the remote and would like to purchase separately. Can I do that?
1,Great item....beautiful! Thank you!
1,Good price.
1,iFlash has knocked it out of the park again. I have purchased a lot of iFlash items and they are always quality products. This one in particular has made my life a lot easier. I have a lot of devices that I carry with me and I use them all a lot. So when I am driving from point A to point B. I like to be able to charge all my devices. This one has two USB charging ports which make it really useful. I plug it into my car charging port and bam three things charging all at once. I am now able to charge my tablet and cellphone at once.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review.
1,"Great product, have droped phone many times, great phone saver!!"
1,A shattered phone is never fun - this case protects very well reducing the chance of glass breakage.
1,Works great
1,You want this. trust me.
1,It does what it's advertised to do. Charges phone quickly and effectively with no issues. A great buy at a great price.
1,"Protects my iPhone 6.<br /><br />Very large case. If place in pocket (for a guy), get ready for some awkward stares, as I have gotten many while walking across my college's campus.<br /><br />Only real con is that dust can easily get underneath the case.<br /><br />*** Putting the case on and taking it off ***<br /><br />The case snaps into place, you need to lift and push the corner and middle clips down. When removing, you need to the same thing. People have stated that it is tedious to remove, but when doing it correctly, it isn't hard at all."
-1,"The wire became lose within a month of having it. Not bent or broke, lose from the part that plugs in."
1,Great!
1,As offered
-1,"Pretty much junk. The microphone was set to 100% on my laptop and still, people could barely hear me."
1,"I am a little worried when there has few reviews , also this is a new item so i am worry about the quality . I am suprised about the polished black adapter face . I LIKE it so much ,then I try to install the clasp to my apple watch band which is back , so i choose the black one . fit well to my watch band . and easy to use with the accesory of tool .<br /><br />NOW i have used for a month , it is still looks good ,and the seller email me ,let me write a review ,I am a fresh man to amazon , but the seller is very patient to tell me how to write ,nice ."
-1,"I would have given this item NO stars. First of all they are NOT Apple, they look more like something you find at the dollar store, so cheap and not sturdy."
1,For the price of this bluetooth earpiece it's very comfortable and worth the money doesn't have all the features of my Jabra Stone but it's still well worth it. Very comfortable to wear and secure in my ear.
1,Real easy to put on and great protection.
1,"Waych performed as exoected, good buy"
0,Good product! Thank you! Hopefully it will fit my phone!
1,S'good.
1,"This is the best cord by far I've ever owned!! Very rugged, durable and super affordable!!! I totally recommend this cord, even more so now that I plan on purchasing the 2 foot cord in a different color!!!"
1,Works for me!
1,Great!
1,A great investment for a lifetime of protection.
1,Works great with iPhone 5c and iPad air !
1,worked great
1,Best phone ever!!!!
1,"I've had this  case for several months and I've dropped my phone etc. the sticker has come off from the back but there was no sticky residue so no biggie to me. I use my phone a lot and this has kept it safe so far even through children throwing it, playing with it, and slobbering on it. This case is great."
1,"Great buy. It holds my phone in place tight. Simple, functional and inexpensive. Definitely recommend it."
1,Very good cover!
1,"This product is better than the $1 or $2 chinese knockoffs, but still is prone to early failure. I bought three of these about 6 months ago, and one of them is pretty much dead, one is on its way out, and the third is still going strong.  The cable looks nice and feels like it is good quality. When they were brand new all of the devices worked seamlessly with it, but over time I could see the pins on the lightning connector start to wear off.  Bottom line: I would pay about $5 for this cable, nothing more."
1,I have big ears. This worked great
1,The only thing is I wish I could switch out the charging cord for a longer one. But other than that it's great!
1,Fun little case. Sling on your shoulder and go.
-1,This case was cracked when it come thru the mail
1,Very easy to use and handy device! VERY happy.
1,"Loved my case it's made of a strong material and everyone has loved the design, thank you!"
-1,It broke the minute I put it on!
1,I was a little disappointed when I got the case because it is a little more rubbery than hard plastic. Also the volume buttons became very easy to press on accident.
1,Goog case
1,smaller than I'm expected
-1,Could not get the old faceplate off to replace.
1,"Absolutely the best bang for buck ive ever had, they were my answer when i used to have kicker vr's then i had kenwood and boss and sundown sa 8's and none compare to qpower, when i first  saw them i was like the extra surround couldnt possibly do anything good but my god does it hit hard and hit low, i currently have one 15 and two tens in my car all qpower, and its the best combo ever!!!! Btw the pic is when i put them in my boxes in my room before they were put into my car."
1,Great product
1,"I really liked the case. The only problem, I thought i was gonna be the same as the iPhone 4 vans case made out of gum rubber. It was still a great case and everything was great about it!"
-1,terrible 1st of all i paid for 2 day shipping and got my package in a week that not 2 day shipping and 2nd the f@$king battery was not even compatible and i made sure i read that it was compatible with my model iphone 5c don't waste your money on this crap!
-1,"Poor quality compared to the real fitbit bands. It looks like a great value, but they all suck, also the metal part they provide is worthless."
1,Works great but the stand once you use it keeps popping out.  Have to use tape to hold in place so it dont pop open when walking.
1,"Everything fit perfectly.  Sturdy case.  The stylus is not telescopic (doesn't stretch out) and the little cord on the attachment is short so you have to detach it to use it but that is not a problem for me.  Also, the stylus tip is very soft, &#34;squishy,&#34; and hollow rather than solid.  Also not a problem for me, though.  Other reviews have mentioned paint wearing off.  I have noticed that happening a little bit along the edges but I figure, for the price, it doesn't bother me.  And it looks like it will be clear if/when the pain does wear off, and I'm okay with clear.<br />Overall, great product for a great price.  Arrive faster than expected and fit perfectly."
1,Great product.
1,Love this case.
1,"Great radar detector and is very easy to use. I have owned a Cobra before and this one is just as impressive. For the price and quality, I highly recommend the Cobra XRS9470."
1,Everything was great
1,"This phone is another Samsung slam dunk. However, it never got 4G for T-Mobile in the US. I don't know if all unlocked phones are going to have this problem. I really liked this phone and all of the features. If you're ok with not being able to get 4G than this will work for you. I did seems to get LTE service but it wasn't fast at all. Again, this could simply be because it's unlocked international.  Great phone and it's very unique. Would definitely buy again if I knew that I could get the speed that 4G has."
1,"Wanted to buy the Bose wireless but was put off by the negative reviews.  For $300, they should be perfect.  Settled on this model for about $60, thinking it was a low risk gamble... boy!  Am I GLAD I DID!  Have worn them for a week solid during 4 hour commuting each day.  Great sound, comfortable for long term wearing, and a great price point for a wireless headphone that doubles for phone calls and music equally well on my Android device.  Definitely a recommendation to buy for anyone looking for clear, crisp sound quality and a comfortable fit over the ear."
1,Allowed us to spread them around the house...
1,It looks really nice
0,The mirror was a little blurry but otherwise fine
1,excellent product! A++++++
1,Good
-1,This cable doesn't charge my iPhone or let me control my music from the car like it's supposed to do.
1,Excellent securing this unit on my windshield to hold my cell phone when traveling
-1,"This is ridiculous the band weighs over three times what the watch does. If Skagen made the bands and Apple the watch you would have, close, to the perfect product."
1,"I've bought 3 of these and love them.  I plug a lot of usb devices into the one by my bed (iPhone, iPad, Bluetooth headset, Pebble watch, and often to recharge portable batteries).  So the fact that they handle various needs is wonderful.  However, one failed (apparently heat related,  if I unplugged it for an hour, it would work again, for a while, before it stopped working).  I contacted their customer service by email and included my Amazon invoice showing that it was only 6 months old, and they sent me a replacement that arrived in 2 days.  Jaimee of Photive was super helpful and I definitely would buy another Photive product.  Also, the one that failed was a 50 watt unit and the replacement was 60 watts -- apparently it's been upgraded and they sent the newer product.  Well done, Photive!<br /><br />By the way, the third unit is kept in our family room on an end table, and I keep extra charging cables in a drawer under it,  this way visitors and family can easily put their phones on charge while visiting,  and when the power goes out, I pull out a fully charged UPS, lug in the photive, and we keep our phones charged easily,  no more unplugging someone else's charging phone so MINE can get charged,"
1,Came on timer super great. So far they work great! Really long nice for across the room and across the car!
0,"My problems with this case were that I couldn't use my extra long iPhone charger cords or other iPhone chargers because of how this case is designed. I would have to take my phone out of the case daily to be able to charge it. The charging cord they send you is okay but very short and a message displayed on my iPhone saying &#34; this accessory is not supported by iPhone.&#34; After I took the case off a few times, it started to crack around the corners bad. A piece even chipped off as a result from all the cracking. If I were going to use on a float trip, or for a water sport, ( just special occasions) then it might be fine. But for everyday use , not so much."
1,Did wussy I needed it to do. Only wish it would protect the whole phone like a phone case
1,"Great customer service, but bad product design"
1,satisfied
1,"Great case by Spigen, protects my iPhone 6+ perfectly.<br />I like how it looks, the buttons are easy to press, works with most lightning cables and headphones.<br />It's a but bulky though, but still looks good and feels nice. I liked the color combination, matches perfectly my space gray iPhone.<br />It can hold for 2 cards and cash perfectly, or even a 3rd card.<br />The only thing I don't like about this case is that the card slot slides VERY easy, so it slides sometimes when I take it out of my pocket or even while holding the phone, that's why I didn't gave 5 stars.<br /><br />Please remember to vote below my review if it was helpful or not helpful. If<br />you choose to vote my review unhelpful, please feel free to leave me a brief comment so I can improve my future reviews as they are important to fellow buyers like us.<br /><br />I received this product with a discount for my honest review."
1,"Great product, works perfect. Delivery was fast. I'm thinking about getting another for school"
1,used twice and wow its great and awesome only family wants me to charge there phone all the time but l told them to buy a huawei
0,The tape is hard to remove from the plastic... It sticks to the plastic.
-1,do not get it unless is new.
-1,It works.. and the door fit perfectly ***UPDATE: it quit holding a charge after a few weeks.
0,"The USB connections are loose, and I have tried these with three different brands of cables. Not terrible. Not great."
1,"Protected my phone like it should, but i was disappoited it broke when i took it off (too bulky for everyday use)"
1,"I was selected to review this product at a discounted rate. It took a while longer than normal to receive the product, however upon arrival I was very pleased. The case is light weight, yet cery durable. I was happy to find that it did not make my phine bulky like other cases. Overall I am very pleased."
1,Works well. Have taken phone underwater and it works!
-1,what is this!
1,Holds my phone while I run. Does what it's supposed to do
1,This is a great device to charge up to 5 USB devices. Traveled in Europe with it and only needed one adapter plug (no transformer!) to charge phones and tablets. It's compact size makes it even better.
1,The color is great!
1,Exactly what i wanted. I love it.
1,I like. Thanks
1,Works good!
1,My first selfie stick ever!! It does a good selfies!!!!
1,Great case. Just not sure about the built in screen protector. Considering removing and replacing with one that would attached to screen. It does bounce a little.
1,I bought these as Christmas gifts for my family last year.  We went on a family cruise last New Years and these worked awesome!  If you are wondering if you will be able to communicate between decks and across the huge ships you can!  I have not had a use since but next cruise they will be charged and packed.  Just plan on over a day to fully charge them at least the first few times.  Used them by the pools with out the worry of them getting wet too!
1,"Awesome window control for any Viper alarm.  You don't need to have a DEI branded alarm to utilize it, but I believe most of the alarms sold in the US is probably from them.<br /><br />The installation was easy, assuming you know exactly what to do, and what each wire function does.  I purchased 2 of these to control 4 windows in my Infiniti I30.<br /><br />The only negative thing about this unit is the programming of the window venting.  I needed to vent the front windows more than normal to get them to vent the right amount.  When I initially programmed both units, the front windows barely vented, but the rear windows vented perfectly.  I initially thought there was a problem with the front windows (not venting at all).  Luckily the programming of the windows is not difficult at all.<br /><br />Last alarm I installed was a Clifford Avantgard 5, with the Smart Windows.  To program the venting, you use a laptop with Cliffnet Wizard.<br /><br />*****Update March 30, 2016*****<br />I am providing an update.  I have been using this alarm system (5704) and two of these window control units.  At times, when trying to vent the windows, one or more of these units will fail to vent the windows.  Once, it only vented one of 2 windows that it's connected to.  I am unsure what is going on, but my connections are solid."
1,Charges my phones much faster than any other wall adapter I have. Not much else to say about a wall charger. Pretty much does the one thing it's supposed to do very very well. Build quality is top notch.
1,This is a great case high quality leather I can't see why anyone would be disappointed.
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
1,They look good. Expensive for being made entirely of plastic. Hope they don't break.
1,"Fast shipping. Easy easy install. Love that when u put it on its not full of bubbles, i only had one and was easy to smooth out. Im very happy with my purchase thanks!"
1,"Performs as expected with little-to-no issues.<br /><br />Attaches to car with a 3M adhesive patch. Make sure you are ready to have this on your car for a while.<br /><br />The button controller attaches to the 3M patch with magnets, and is easy to remove and hide.<br /><br />The multi-slot USB charger is a great value in itself."
1,Great mount.  Keeps GPS on dash without sliding.
-1,Has a very noticeable hissing noise. Wouldn't recommend.
1,"very good product very comfortable to use but it is also inconvenient, if your phone runs out of charge during the day your only option is to removed the wireless receiver from the phone in order to use a charging cable"
1,I love this screen protector! It works great and very easy to apply!
0,Buttons hard to press even after cutting them.  Ports have sharp edge's disappointed with Spigen they are usually top notch.
1,none
1,Great quality and very bright wonderful colors. They are very high quality ink. I had no issues with it.
1,Very comfortable to use. I have shoulder problems and this helps reduce the pain I live with. At least this mouse doesn't add to my shoulder pain the way a conventional mouse does.
1,Super happy with this product.... One of the best in the market....
1,"I just installed the 3rd of the three sheets that come in the pack. I replaced the first one at 6 months, and now just a few weeks down the road I had an accident that created a need for another replacement.  Each one has been as painless to install as any screen protector I have ever used.  They fit, and they come with little sticky tabs to remove the fuzz after install and eliminate bubbles.  I made the mistake of leaving my phone on the roof of my car, I realized at about 60 mph when I heard it slide off.  I stopped to pick it up from the middle of the road, and dreading the worst I flipped it over.  This screen protector was scuffed and torn to shreds, I peeled it off and had only a shallow scratch of less than 1/8th inch that had gone through.  I did have a &#34;light duty&#34; case on the phone with helped as well.  I may have been lucky in how it landed, but I certainly credit this product with helping save my screen from cracks or scratches.  I will be ordering another pack soon."
1,"i just got the charger from the mail. i would like to say it works great and very portable. unbiased opinion this is the best portable station i ever got,"
1,"I have up graded my iPhone 5 but keep it and use it as a player for my audio books.  With this Horn Stand, it now is loud enough to hear without earbuds or external speaker that needs recharging.  The case protects my phone and the horn speaker works as well as a rechargeable one.  Great product!"
-1,DO NOT BUY.  Doesn't work.
1,Lovely case and a great value.
1,You'll be very satisfied just like me!  (&#62;‿◠)✌
1,"This is perfect! We recently bought a kayak and have been spending lots of time on the water. I wanted something that was convenient, waterproof AND that I could take pictures through. This fabulous pouch fit the bill perfectly! It fits around your neck via a lanyard, seals tight, and is definitely waterproof. It made me feel so much better to have this with me while on some of our kayaking trips. Below is a photo that I took while on the kayak, with the phone in the case. As you can see, no problems whatsoever! I love this!<br /><br />This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes.

1,"Sound great over factory speakers for a Chevy Blazer. Much more bass yet no amp added.<br /><br />6 month update on the Kenwood KFC-1665S 6.5 inch 2 way speakers:<br />We have now been listening to these Kenwood speakers in our Chevrolet Blazer for the past six months. The speakers have gone through extreme temperatures from hot to frigged cold, and I mean frigged as in minus 35 degrees, during these past 6 months. And the speakers have came through like champs. There has been no distortion from the Kenwood speakers that were installed to replace the factory GM paper speakers that came with the truck. We have no noise, crackling or even whine from these Kenwood speakers. The sound is good, rich, crisp and will give you some thump. These are not bass speakers so do not assume you will rock the house down. But they can get plenty loud enough that two people sitting side by side have to scream at the top of the lungs to be heard.<br /><br />This is not our first pair of these Kenwood speakers, as I have purchased them in the past (maybe slightly different model numbers) for some of the other Chevrolet Blazers that we have owned before. I have always came back to these Kenwood speakers as they fit well in the factory opening with no alterations. They are not paper coned so no need for any liquids that might be spilled on them through the door speaker grill. And for the fact they sound so good for such a small price!<br /><br />If you are not trying to build a sound studio in your vehicle, and are just looking for a good upgrade to the cheap factory speakers that are found in most vehicles. I would recommended trying out these Kenwood speakers in your vehicle. You will easily see a difference between the factory speakers to the Kenwood speakers. Even the daughter enjoys them and you know how the young generation likes to turn their music up. We plan on buying more of these to put into our Honda as well. I would easily recommended these Kenwood speakers to friends and family and to anyone who is seeking good, basic sound from a basic quality speaker.<br /><br />We were not paid nor discounted in any way, shape or form for giving our honest opinion here of this product as a review to assist others.

1,Fast delivery and great quality product!
1,"Let me start off by saying I was sent this case to review it by the amazing folks at Anker. Now let me tell you why they're amazing. I've bought and used the Mophie and UNU charging cases for my iPhone 6, all of whom say I'll get 125% battery for the size of the case, & yes they do give you that charge more or less. I travel a lot for work and do not have the convenience of having a wall outlet. Nor do I want to lug battery packs around in my purse (but often I do, with two iPhones, a Mac and an iPad sometimes it's needed). Anyway let's get back on track, this case gives me the 125% charge and a little more. It's quite easy on the eyes. Which the Mophies do compare. The UNU cases tend to be much more shiny and as a result often slipped when nuzzled between your shoulder and ear. This case however, stays in place! It's extremely light and if you're someone with small pockets and purses, this case is not nearly as long as the UNU & Mophie (even a hair makes a difference when it comes to handbags and pockets!) lastly this case is secure. Instead of the traditional slide the upper half into the lower half design that both the other manufacturers use, Anker designed a case that snaps in place much like the old Speck cases or standard 2 piece cases that most manufacturers use! I prefer that design as it isn't as likely to come apart or have charging issues! Oh and the price is on point most of the other cases are priced higher than this one... Had this have been on the market when I purchased my other cases, well I wouldn't have a graveyard of battery cases rendered useless due to design and technical flaws. Finally, this isn't the first Anker product I've used. This is the first the company has sent me, and I can't say I would have a problem considering them first for my next purchase for an accessory as every product I've used thus far from them has been FANTASTIC."
1,Pretty cool. What I was expecting
1,"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
-1,Thoiught I bought a different item.  It turns out this will work also.
-1,Phone overheated with this on. but still a good purchase.
0,"I just bought these two way radios for a trip on a 10 mile long lake, and we were lucky to communicate over a distance of two miles over mostly open water.  We were using the rechargeable batteries that were included with the product, and they were fully charged.  I was expecting better performance."
1,"Edit:  Seller contacted me and apologized for the inconvenience.  Also sent a replacement unit, which also arrived really fast and is working perfectly.  Overall very satisfied with not only the actual working product, but also the seller as well.  Wonderful customer service, and definitely will be who I look at when in need of another one.<br />Original Review: Product arrived really fast.  This review is more of a 2.5 but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Overall it's a great product and gets the job done, only issue I had with it is that one of the ports wouldn't work for me.  I bought this specifically because it had the 3rd port for an upcoming long road trip.  One for my phone, one for my ipod and one for my girlfriend to charge her phone.  Not really a big deal but it would've been nice to not have to switch the wires around while on the road."
1,I keep it in my travel bag and use it in rental cars.  It's easy to pack and can accommodate an iPhone 6 and even a Nexus 6.
1,Fit perfect and works very well.
0,"Had it about a week now and I think it was definitely worth the money. I like the option to switch out the back panel for different designs or colors. I also like that it has good protective corners for the inevitable times I drop my phone. There is enough of a lip around the screen to offer at least some protection against dropping face down.<br />Cons: Cannot use the phone's built in heart monitor with the case on. Also makes it slightly more difficult to get the cover off of the charger port, although not impossible."
1,Very nice iphone 6 case if u like shaco. I enjoy it alot
1,works great and love the second usb port. no problems with it yet and i have used it everyday since i purchased it. (4+ months)
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
-1,The case worked great  for the first few weeks. The piece you pull down in order for the phone to fit broke. I thought it will be ok because I would be able to line it backup in place but nope. It no longer charges my phone. I paid less than 7.00 for it and that is the amount of use I got out of it.
1,Works great
-1,"The suction cup doesn't stick to anything. I've cleaned every surface and the cup itself and tried all over my car with out any success. I did manage to find 1 spot that lasted about 24hrs before it pulled off a awkward spot on my door under the drivers side window where I managed to get it to stick, then of course it fell off at the worst possible time as I was driving and fell to the side of my seat, then moved Milameters at a time just far enough so I couldn't reach it as I was driving. So I ended up hearing my phone ring all the way back to my house because I had it hooked to my car speakers listening to music. The 1 plus of this thing is the magnet works very well, oh which reminds me, after getting this thing I slowly realized that the metal tabs that you hooked to your phone that this mount sticks to blocks your signal. I didn't realize what was going on until I back tracked the time in which my signal started messing up to the time this came in. All in all use the &#34;life hack&#34; version of the car phone mount and use a rubber band that will go through your air vent slats/grill and back out holding your phone to the air vent."

1,Tiny but powerful
1,Good product.  Works great with my NOTE 3.  Nice to not have to fight the low battery issue all of the time.
1,Flexible but not quite as easy to use as I hoped. Wish it had a concealed full-width zipper pocket as well.
0,Do you have any video show how to do the installation?
1,I Like  this Headphone but if you  seed them in  for repair or  get replacement it will be a Long Time before  you get them  back. I'm still  whating for  my  to come back. If  I  what in  longer I  my  go  BandO  Company for My Headphone. I really  like  the  Headphone But  whating a Long time  repair or and replacement Thats  not  Good for me when  you  pay  this kind of money  for  high End Headphone I  was  hoping  gething repair or  replace meant to be fast
1,"So far so good! Just received it, super fast shipping, and quality packaging. Currently testing it out with my 1st gen ipad mini and so far so good!"
-1,I bought thos battery in hopes it would last longer than the original one with no such luck it is just as bad. It doesn't hold up any longer. My phone has been off of the charger less than 10 minutes and I'm already down to 89%.
1,"I don't normally leave feedback, but this deserves one. I LOVE my case. Those color it's so pretty, the ridges on the back provide a nice grip, cut outs are precise, not cheap feeling, provides great protection. I've dropped my phone twice and it's in tip top shape!"
-1,Earphones were staticky when plugged into the earjack - def not worth the money - returned my item and got a refund.
1,"The iClever IC-QC01 18W Quick Charge was meant to become an extra for my purse, because I wanted to make sure I had one when I was on the go.<br />It arrived in a box with the user manual, warranty card (1 year), the iClever IC-QC01 18W Quick Charge 2.0 Wall Charger and a 3.3ft Micro USB Cable.<br />I plugged it right in and began testing it to charge two cell phones, and a tablet. It worked with all three with no issues.<br />It charge the phones in no time at all (less than an hour) and the tablet, which was DOA, took a little over an hour. Still far faster than the charging cords that came with the devices.<br />It is a lightweight model and fits in any standard outlet. It is a compact design which allows you to use the other outlet at the same time, so it doesn't cover it.<br />It is a great design, quality materials and I feel like it will last awhile.<br />The only thing I was slightly bothered by was the length of the charging cord. With it only being 3 feet, it doesn't allow for much wiggle room or usage of the device while charging unless you are sitting next to the outlet. (which I am not). I did try a different longer cord with it and had the same awesome results as above and was able to still use the devices while charging.<br />I received this to facilitate this review, however all opinions are 100% honest and my own!"
-1,Ueless to me....I have a 2000 Buick LeSaber
-1,after assembling the screen it immediatly came apart on the sides.  not cheap to buy and really disappointed that the quality is not that great.
1,Goof for what I need
0,"It fits my tmobile note 4 but it's not hot pink at all, my volume goes down everytime I touch the side of the phone."
1,"great quality, fast shipping"
1,Great product
1,I HATE iPhone cases but I heard the iPhone 6 is pretty slippery. Anyway this is probably as slim as you can get while still actually getting some protection from drops. I recommend this case.
0,"The protector is clear and is a good bargain. However, the front-facing camera is covered by the glass (there is no cutout for it). The screen is fully covered by the glass, but it was not cut large enough to reach the top and bottom of the entire front face of the phone. It is merely an aesthetic issue, though, and does not affect the functionality"
1,Good
1,Works great in my 2011 Ford Ranger. Dual 2.4amp USB for charging any cell phone! Works great!
1,Great case. Protective without being bulky.
1,Good charger and speed i used it in lg g flex 1 and flex 2
1,Fit great. Nice product.
1,"As many have pointed out, this unit has some shortcomings but keep in mind, you cannot compare this low cost unit with a unit costing much, much more. Personally, I think the vx7020 is the best value out there when you compare the features to the cost. To me the radio quality seems as good as any other radio I've had but although I like to listen to the radio I am not an audiophile. I installed this to replace a dash top Garmin GPS and Jabra Tour hands free speaker, both excellent products. Like any all-in-one unit, I didn't expect this to do each function as well as the dedicated units but I was looking to reduce clutter and wires and this fit the bill perfectly.  After using it for a couple of weeks I am very happy with the purchase. Other than downloading the free map upgrade from naviextras.com (see below) I haven't found anything that I am not happy with. Like anything new it takes some getting used to but I like the nav software much better than the Garmin and haven't found any of the functions to be frustrating (like on the Garmin when I am an hour from Springfield, MA and do a search for the city 'Springfield' it comes back with a list of Springfields in Missouri, California, Texas, Montana..., and finally Massachusetts. No rhyme or reason to the order). In fact, the search and results are much better than the Garmin in my opinion. It's obviously using the same maps. There is a left turn at an intersection near my house that I take most every day. If I have set a route to follow the Garmin would tell me to go straight through the intersection, make a u-turn, then come back and take a right (like a left turn is not allowed). The vx7020 does the exact same thing.  If you are going from stand-alone units to an in-dash unit you are going to find some differences common to all in-dash units and the vx7020 is no different.. 1. Sun glare - When the sun is shining in a side window it is very difficult to see the screen. You cannot just change the angle like a dash-top unit 2. Updates -  You cannot just plug this into a USB port on your computer and run updates. As it turns out, there is a micro SD card plugged into this unit right next to the USB connection. For some reason it seems to be a big secret as it isn't highly documented. When updating the maps (free for the first time within 30 days of activating the unit) you need to remove the micro SD and use the navitools (crappy tool and worse support) to install the updates 3. Programming - If you are going to manually enter all your nav favorites, stations, etc. it is a pain to have to sit in the car rather than just taking a dash-top into your house. If you do a lot at once you are sure to end up with a sore neck from leaning over to see the screen. 4. Less clutter - The interior of your car is much cleaner without the clutter on your dash or stuck to your windshield and wires running to the power outlets 5. Integration - I love the sound integration when you get a call and it automatically cuts out the radio and announces the call. This is very comparable to units from the manufacturer costing thousands as an option in a new car.  For this Jensen vx7020 specifically: - The big problem with this unit is dealing with the naviextras.com site to get the free upgrade. What a bunch of bozos. I have Macbook and Linux computers, no Microsoft Windows. To get the upgrade you can only do it with a Windows computer using their tool. The website support and email support are extremely difficult to use due to language issues. Personally, I admire anyone who can communicate in more than one language as I only know English. But I can't believe it when a company offers tech support and doesn't care enough to hire someone fluent in the language to write a description or provide an explanation. On this site you'll find incomplete sentences, or incomplete thoughts, references to things that do not exist (&#34;See list below&#34; although there is no list below), etc. They obviously don't careabout customer support or at least not as much as saving money. That is my only rant with this product... - This is minor but frustrating - I cannot believe they do not include six to eight screws to attach support brackets if needed. Maybe the support brackets should include screws but Jensen knows the thread size required and really, would it seriously affect their bottom line if they included $.25 worth of screws?. As it is, when you get to the point of getting ready to install this you need to put everything on hold while you run down to the local hardware store for a few screws... This gives you an idea of how much I like this vx7020 when my big gripe is not getting a few cents worth of screws... - I was all set to rant that I couldn't turn off nav voice and leave the radio and phone volume on until I realized I just hadn't discovered the feature yet. Sometimes I use nav locally just to get an eta or know distances but I don't need or want the nav voice, especially with it interrupting the radio. As it turns out, you can mute just the nav through nav settings while keeping the radio on or using hands-free calling. There is also an easy 'mute all' by quickly pressing the volume knob. As it turns out, several things that I found to be lacking turned out to just need a little research to find out how to make it work. - The hands-free bluetooth has been flawless. The microphone works great and the sound comes through the speakers perfectly. - There is a frustratingly slow warning process when you start nav which basically says &#34;Don't be stupid and stare at the screen while driving&#34; which you need to acknowledge. The warning and acknowledgement only takes about 15 seconds but it happens whenever you start the nav which is any time you start your car. There is an easy fix for this though. By adding the lines below to the sys.txt file on the sd card: [debug] skip_eula=1 [interface] drive_carefully=0 This will bypass the warning and let the nav start right up.(Notice the part where drive_carefully=0=false). A big thank you to the person who included this in their review which I found along with information that an SD card exists, you saved me from a lot of frustration.  Things I'd like to see: 1. There is an option to have the screen time out and go blank if you are not on the navigation screen. It amazes me that the screen is completely blank. I would be great if a clock displayed. Every car radio I've ever seen displays the time whether the radio is on or off so I find myself looking over to the blank screen to get the time. I guess I'll get used to this but again, why not display the time, at least in a corner or something? 2. If you shut the radio off you turn off everything, including the Bluetooth speaker for the phone. My work around for this is to select a non-existent video input (to turn off the radio) and just let the screen go blank. I think it would be slicker to have the Bluetooth stay on (and display the time) when the unit is turned off. If I don't want to use the Bluetooth I can always just turn it off on my phone. 3. It would be nice to have a radio 'off' button. As it is now, if you want to turn the radio off you need to select something like 'Bluetooth' or an input that has no connection. I guess I'll get used to it but a on/off button for the radio would be a nice little feature. Obviously this would be partially taken care of by implementing my previous comment. 4. Again, you can't expect this vx7020 to have all the features of a stand-alone device but to me it is pretty basic to have the capability to use Siri or 'Hey Google' or whatever voice capability your phone has directly from the deck. In order to use Siri to dial I need to make sure my phone is handy so I can press the Siri button. It works fine through the system once Siri is awake but why not just have a button to push on the vx7020 screen to initiate Siri? Maybe I was just spoiled with this feature on the Jabra Tour. At the very least itshould accept voice commands to dial the phone hands-free. As it comes, the only way to dial your phone is to punch in the numbers on the screen or scroll through your phonebook to find it, neither one of which is a good idea to do while driving. 5. All the components are there, a microphone and speakers and nav unit. Why not make the leap and add voice commands to the unit for navigation and dialing?  Overall I think this is a great unit. When you consider the low cost it's an excellent value. It's not perfect but the deficiencies are minor. Even though there are some short-comings I'm going with a five-star rating because the cost is so low I have to overlook the few missing features.  After using this unit for over a year I wish I had spent the money to get a better unit and I've downgraded to 4 stars for the following reasons: 1. This unit is basically a computer. It runs on a Windows operating system and is frustratingly slow. Every time you start your car it takes a while for the unit to power up. I have to believe that if this was running on a Linux, OSX, IOS, android, chrome or most any other operating system it would be much faster. 2. Reason 1 would be minimized if there was an option for this to stay powered for say 30 minutes or an hour after turning off your car so that if you got out of your car for a few minutes you wouldn't have to wait for it to power back up again. If you are in a spot where you actually need the backup camera you need to sit and wait before it will come on. And the camera starts much faster than the radio or navigation. 3. There is a button on the main screen that says simply &#34;AS&#34;. The &#34;AS&#34; stands for auto search and if you hit the button it doesn't say &#34;Are you sure?&#34; or give any kind of warning, it just jumps right in and wipes out all your presets and sets them to the first stations it finds in a scan. Really? On the main screen? Not even one level down so that you wouldn't reach for your vent and accidentally wipe out all your stations??? You can be sure it wasn't a nuclear scientist that designed this 4. The navigation turns out to not be as good as Garmin or TomTom. The arrival time estimates are way off, given a choice it will pick the worse route to your destination, and like everything with this unit, it is slow - make a wrong turn and it's a frustrating wait for the route to be recalculated. 5. This has five groups or bands of presets. Two bands for AM and three for FM. If you switch from an AM station to an FM station you need to change bands. So say, just for example, you only listen to one AM station and one FM station. You are listening to your AM station and want to switch to your FM station. You need to change bands to AM2, then to FM1 and then select your station. To switch back to your AM station you need to change bands to FM2, then FM3, then AM1 and select your station. And guess what? It's a slow process to change bands. Any modern digital radio allows you to set presets to a combination of AM and FM in the same grouping.  I guess that's a lot of grips but I'll still give it four stars because it is a lower cost and I don't expect it to have the features of a higher priced unit by personally, I wish I had paid the extra money and got something that doesn't run on Windows or is better designed. It would have been a lot less frustration and more enjoyment."
-1,The heat inside the car made the item fall apart. The magnet wont stick to the car either. The audio always has a hissing sound when connected to a device. This was a complete waste of money!
1,"The only thing is, when You want to use letters  at the side left or right is a little pain in the neck, to closedand the bottom to turn the phone to mute don't work"
-1,"One capped out after a few wks now using the other one, price was reasonable."
-1,I didn't even work for 24 hours. I returned it for a refund.
1,"Is a great product, I put it to my phone as soon as arrive. Thank you guy's that was really fast."
1,"Charger works great, I have charged a GoPro, an IPad and iPhone at the same time, really happy!"
1,"Excellent.  Fits my iPhone 6 perfectly.  I use it while on my sit down mower, and cycling.  Phone does not get wet when I sweat."
-1,just don't like it
1,Looks great. But it doesn't stay on well. If you drop your phone it breaks appart and falls of the phone. Its more for looks I guess. Which is fine with me. The HTC one m8 is pretty durable itself so I'm sure it I'll be okay.
1,"I can't live without music, and these ear phones have the bass every music lover desires... Another great feature about the device is that it speaks to you. Tells you when it's turned on-off, when it connects to a device and when it gets to the loudest volume. The buttons are easy to use, you can start-pause-skip songs with the buttons. Just play around with them and you'll figure it out. As it turned out, these ear buds have a combination of really clever design features which make them my current favorites. Sound quality, this is perfect too. This is very good, comparable to more expensive brands, and I love to be able to hear layering and detail in my sound, rather than just loud noises. There is good balance between treble and bass, which is also unusual, with most ear buds rendering bass poorly. In conclusion, I am very happy with this headset. It works well, pairs easily with all the devices I have tried it with, battery life is good, fit is excellent and stays comfortable for long periods of wearing it, sound is above average to great, price is competitive, and it is a tiny thing to carry around. Definitely worth buying!"
-1,Charges slowly
-1,Didn't work. . . At all. :-/
1,Very easy to apply and so far I'm extremely satisfied
-1,I got defective item returned.
1,I have been trying to find the right light weight phone case that is also sturdy. This case is exactly what I wanted. It is slim to the phone and has a sturdiness to it that I am not afraid it is going to just peel off or break. I like the see through back because I can put pictures in the case and have a thousand different cases in one. It is made of a premium material. I will be using this phone case a lot. Especially when I have meetings to go to. My regular bulky case isn't to professional. I also love that it comes with a screen protector.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review.
1,Great
1,"Good product, highly recommended"
1,Using it to hold a cell phone for an elderly person. Works great!
1,Nice case
1,"Beautiful case.  Did not think the pen would be helpful,  but my husband finds it much easier than trying to get his big fingers on the right place.  He has some small motor control issues,  so this had really been a help!"
1,"I use this charger for my iphone 6 plus.  As a case, it provides reasonable protection against routine bumps and drops.  As a backup charger, it's good for 80% charge of a fully drained iphone 6 plus.  Unlike certain other charger cases, this charger uses iphone's own charging cord and let's you use regular headphones without a special adapter, which is really convenient.  Unfortunately, you cannot charge the iphone while the phone is in the case.  You can only charge the case and then use the case to charge the phone."
1,It's a cool case and it's cute I love it I would just say block up the ends
1,I love this case! Cute and holds up well!
1,So far so good!
1,excellent for the price
1,"iCarez has always made the best screen protectors.  I've been using their products since the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and every time I have to install a screen protector it's a very simple task.<br /><br />This time was no different, very great product by iCarez"
1,Very good.
0,"The fit is a little off, but other then that it's a good case"
1,Pretty color with adequate protection
1,nice as expected
-1,The kickstand doesn't  work properly as offered.<br />The edges of the cover don't  let manipulate the edges app.
1,Works perfectly
1,"Cant wait to take it on vacation ! Arrived on time, and works great with my iPhone."
1,This is what I needed but didn't realize the weight. It's about as big as an iPhone 6 but 3x's thicker. Charges quickly and still have more charges if need to charge other things
0,I have an HTC One in an Otter Defender case. The phone grips on the mount are not quite wide enough nor tall enough to hold the phone and case securely. If it was not for the rubberized pads it would not hold the phone & case at all. The part that goes into the CD slot works fine.
-1,Screw stripped out and it fell apart after less than 10 uses. Junk.
-1,We bought the 3 pack and only one of the three cords included worked correctly. One of the others works if a specific side of the connector faces up. I would not purchase this brand again.
1,Excellent product. Works great. It's very easy to place my phone on the magnet and it hold very well.
1,Greater!
1,"This is the ONE BEST accessory I have ever owner for my iPhone and LOVE IT. I would NEVER go without one, now that I have used it. It does EVERYTHING that is promised, easy to use, fits perfectly in a case brand I use (one size larger then previous), protects my phone, prevents me from hitting darn buttons by accident, looks and feels like a typical case...on and did I mention the BEST and MAIN reason I got it....I can go a whole day and sometimes still be at 100% reading on my Phone!!!! Prior, it would NEVER make it through a day with out a booster charge or two!! This device for your phone (for all compatible models) is a MUST HAVE ACCESSORY. I hate even to use the word accessory. It should ne a NESSISITY. I STRONLY recommend this to all that seek more (REALLY MORE) battery power, that will make a small fingerprint in size, real easy on the wallet and is built with high quality to last...and it still looks so good....make may phone look better with added protection! You can't go wrong. And this seller is fantastic!!! I will always but this one from this seller via Amazon!"
1,The product arrived as promised and is working wonderfully! Thank you!
1,Great product
1,Great fit. But pretty slippery.
1,I'm so happy with this phone. I had asked tons of questions of other owners on Amazon and everyone was so helpful that I made the leap and bought the phone. I am so glad I did. This is  my first Android and it's the best for a first timer or an old pro. Thanks to everyone on Amazon I've now have this great cell phone!
1,"I like.is very,stronger,and water proof,niceeeeee,,"
1,Works great. I've had it for about a year!!
-1,"Let me start off by saying this case is very nice looking. It is sleek and has a great texture to it. However, after using the case for only a few weeks, it has started falling apart. The case fits the device VERY tightly. Definitely too tight of a fit. It was incredibly difficult to take the case off of the phone, during a couple instances when I needed to take my SD card out. It seems that after difficultly prying the case off of the phone, the bumper part of the case has begun to peel off. This is very unfortunate for me as I really like this case. I would like to get a new one, but I feel that this flaw is too great. I have to take my case off now and then, which is impossible with this case."
1,"Good speaker, very easy to use. Super loud for indoors or a small outdoor space. I was looking for something louder for a large indoor space.<br />But good, solid speaker.<br />Seller was great!!!"
1,I love it. It does exactly what the description says
1,I love this case! The only reason I gave it a four star is cause trash easily gets under the screen protector and have to take it apart to get it out!! Fix please!!!
-1,"I used the item once. While on my first ride, I hit a bunch going 16mph and one of the arms holding the phone popped off.  Because I was in a huge pack I couldn't go back and get it so after one use I am left with a dysfunctional mount holder.  I will also say that I continually had to re-adjust the phone due to any light road bumps causing it to move in a different position.  I would not recommend this brand. I don't know if a more expensive one will be better."
1,This is a great case!  It's arrived quickly and is made very well...seems solid!
1,I like it
-1,The case fits over the phone buttons so you can't use it. I ended up going case-free.
1,Charge Iphone 5 more than 3 times and Ipad 4 once
1,"Easy to setup and use, my husband and I loved it! Made pictures of us on vacation possible"
1,"I like the fact that it give you privacy and it's easy to put on. I did have to cut a small piece where the light blanks on my phone In order to see it better ( galaxy s5) but other than that, I enjoy my screen."
-1,Dropped my phone and the case broke right a way
1,I like very much
1,Everything was as promised.  Thanks!
-1,"Made cheap,looks cheap...will never use"
-1,"It didn't fit my ear very well. Fell out frequently, disconnected itself, callers could not hear me very well. I had to order another brand. Sorry, I really wanted to like it."
1,"I like these devices. I bought two last year at the full price and gave them as Christmas presents.<br />This one I bought for myself and is working great.<br />It comes with a USB cable for charging, but my cell phone adapter works fine.<br />Con - The suction cup works better on a tile or glass surface than on a fiberglass shower."
1,Works great & phone fits fine.
-1,"One word GARBAGE!  Not for Samsung galaxy Note4.  I come to realize if these did work they woudnt be the price that they are.  Scratched my phone case cover and I think possibly the lens, bringing to my wireless provider to check if indeed it has a scratch. Dont be stupid all these reviews are BS! Probably paid to give good reviews!"
0,"It really is just ok, yes its leather and yes it does fit the mouse but just barely. To fully insert the mouse into the sleeve you make it harder for you to take it out of the sleeve. So I insert it just enough to leave enough of the mouse out so I can grab it to pull it out"
1,Very good product.
-1,"Great case to protect the phone. My phone died, so I had to return the phone and take off the case. I had to bend the aluminum case just to get it off, pretty much breaking it. Impossible to get off once it's on your phone."
1,The long cable along with its illumination is just what I was looking for... Great product!
1,"This is exactly as it says - Clever!  Very simple to install and use, easy to follow directions.  Please note- you must have an auxiliary input to use this.<br /><br />From the time I opened the package, removed the contents and read the instructions to actually installing and using was under 10 minutes, most of my time was deciding the ideal place to mount it!<br /><br />After it was literally a minute until I was testing a hands free call to my wife.  She said the vocal was clear and by using the cars stereo system I of course had no effort hearing her.<br /><br />Pairing the device was simple and quick too.  Plus this has last device paired memory, which is convenient when taking your phone with you and returning back to your car.<br /><br />This is a great hands free kit!"
1,Very simple to use and very reliable. Reasonable price as well.
1,So far so good. It works great and hasn't conked out like other car chargers I have purchased in the past
1,"I have had this stereo for a few months. The bluetooth works seamlessly once paired. It will even control pandora.  It works great from a sd card. I have had a little trouble with the usb but had to reformat it and works fine. The only thing missing is an external microphone, when driving people have a hard time hearing me because it is internal to stereo."
1,"I bought this stand for my boyfriend and he loves it! So much better than laying the watch down onto the charger. He loves it so much, I'm buying another one for me! The charger snaps into place easily and the stand seems sturdy enough not to tip over. Priced well."
1,Just for winding the angle
1,Good quality
1,Low profile and fast charger. Comes with the car charger and a 3' cord
1,Delivered on time and in new condition. Fits perfectly and performs flawlessly.
1,"After 5-hour long workouts....I can say that I am loving my experience with these.<br />I recommend them. Personally, I can not vouch for how they deal with running, but on a step climber and weight lifting, there are golden."
1,The case was really nice when I got it and didn't take that long to get to my house. The rubber raps around the front of the case which I like a lot. The only problems I had with the case were that the back of it is made of fabric so strings start to hang off the case and you have to cut them off or go over them with a lighter quickly to get rid of them.
1,"Protectors look great when first applied. Ordered 2 for my wife and I. They lasted about a month before being cracked. No drops or anything, just everyday use seemed to crack it which I thought was strange. I contacted the company and they sent new ones out. Applied those and they lasted about the same time. Of the replacements they sent out: 1 cracked due to a single drop of the phone (my fault) and the other one is still alright. For $10, I would expect these to be more durable, but they are what the are. The company was extremely friendly and courteous which is why I give 4 stars, but the actual protectors are so-so."
1,Rugged and stylish. Perfect case that lasted for a long time.
0,Sides are getting damaged after 3 months of usage if its hit with something.
1,Easy to apply. Stays put
1,runs a little small<br />perfect condition<br />Thank You!
1,Great quality.  Very solid construction and a rubberized texture.  The volume is loud enough to use on conference calls etc.  The battery life is great also; about three days if I leave it on accidentally.  I almost dropped $100 on a Jawbone but glad I took a chance on this one.  I don't know if the Jawbone is louder etc. but this performs to the level I need it so I am happy.
-1,It does not charge well had it plugged in all night and it wasn't charged it was @ 60% . Not pleased
0,Good but alittle smaller than screen
1,Love it!!!!!.
1,Real Happy with this purchase......have used it to charge up tablet then phone and had plenty to spare.......Very cool battery.
1,"I bought 4 of these car mounts. They work perfectly. The phone stays put with the magnet, and there is no need to fiddle with clamps like other mounts. I am very happy with this purchase"
0,"Very nice watch. Display is big and you can change it. There are lots of free options to download. It does use android os but a different one: tizen. It does not have a cell chip, so it only works as a phone when connected to your phone or tablet.  It is very convenient for tablet users (I own a samsung 10.1 2014 edition) and I can answer the phone while driving or walking the streets with the tablet inside my bag. You can make phone calls and send sms just talking with svoice. It Works only fairly,  It is a little slow and makes some mistakes but It is usable.<br />Camera has only fair quality pictures and video is kore acceptable.  It is right there on wrist and able to shoot in a moment. The only cons is that images a blurred sometimes.  Maybe due to dust.  I think it also has some focus issues.  I find hard it hard to focus that has only tow options automatically and macro. I don't know if it is defective and if it is, is out of warranty. ... added some pictures taken with it. I don't know how to post videos....the sharp pictures are older.... I cleaned the watch lensee before shooting. .... that is sad because is not usable for a short period of usage"
1,I've had this headset for a few weeks now and I love it! Great range. So much better than a previous high-end brand I had and returned. Earbuds occasionally fall out but I've found If I just turn them the stay in perfectly.
1,I love this thing. I take it everywhere
-1,"Bubbles. I followed the directions exactly. When it said to remove the yellow sheet the entire protector came off, even after squeegeeing. So this static electric pulled in dust when reapplied. The bubbles never went away either like the directions said. It was also very Smeary from fingerprints, not like the glass screen. I returned for another product, glass this time."
1,Just perfect!!
1,It' was like brand new
1,Pleased with product
1,Love it
1,nice new item
1,"It'd be nice to be able to activate voice commands from this device, but overall the product works as intended."
-1,"Great wallet and phone case....at first. Phone case deteriorated quickly. The wear on the case showed within a week, but I mostly ignored it. Then about a month in the case started getting cracks with the smallest amount of pressure, even just from taking it out(never dropped it). Maybe I just got a bad one? But the wallet is great! Sometimes it won't clasp with the phone if you have too many coins in the zipper part, but otherwise it's solid."
0,Okay.not confident it is fully waterproof.
1,Excellent product. Works perfectly with my ipad3
1,Item was as described and works perfect. Don't let the low price prohibit you from buying!
-1,Crappy waited for this for my work walkie talkie and it dont even work what a waist of my time and my money
1,Good product would like a protection or the front
1,Works great...
-1,Plugged in iPhone 6. Screen said: &#34;This cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone.&#34; Phone would not charge. Sent cable back to Amazon within 24 hrs. Do NOT recommend.
-1,Product was shipped already broke. Cheap plastic. I wouldn't trust it to protect my phone.
-1,broke within a week
1,"Good product.  Along with the screen protector I also bought, I feel safer carrying th IPod around."
1,Awesome
-1,Not  at all what I expected.
1,As expected
1,This cable was exactly as described. I've been using it for nearly a month and have no complaints. It charged my Note 3 at the same rate the factory cable once did (before I bent the cable constantly over a year until it weakened). This 3 foot cable is actually much more convenient than the 6 foot one that came with the Note 3 for my needs.
1,"great, you can hear crystal clear."
1,Excellent case. Especially for the money!
1,Not yet best color but works really well. Can charge my phone and table to full capacity
0,Good case ..but it does not protect all the phone ..top and bottom is unprotected !! Nevertheless looks good quality !
1,"This massive behemoth is able to charge my phone and tablet two times each. It is amazing however a little inconvenient to carry around, so it's inordinately for over night trips."
1,Nice case
1,Great case for the money. Hope it holds up over time. OB lasted less than 1 yr.
1,All right
1,"I like this charger. It is a good length, light weight, easy to use, no problem plugging it in. It seems to me that it charges faster than the OEM. Very good product."
-1,The reason I gave it two stars is unlike the original cable it only charge on one side.
1,"Excellent to charge 2 simultaneous devices like smartphones, tablets and laptops while traveling in a car."
1,thanks
1,Fits my Droid Turbo perfectly.  I don't need an outer cover.
1,Works great on my bicycle
1,Very pleased.
1,Going to reorder another for later! It is exactly what I wanted.
-1,D.O.A ! enough said returned.
1,Thank you.
1,"Pretty cool, simple solution to minimizing your wallet. Do be careful about your phone size, though, because I had a Lifeproof case on my Galaxy S4 with this band on it and I had to be cautious taking it out of my pocket as sometimes the band would slip off the corners and dump my essentials on the floor."
1,"Have not mastered it yet,voice command not working properly"
1,"This case is great, easy to get things in and stays put.  I was surprised I could get as many cards, at least 4.  A must have if you need to carry license, cc, room key, and some cash."
1,I love it!
1,Great phone.
1,Excellent but the upper part after some time will not close properly so I had to remove it<br />Charging is excellent
0,"Seems to be watertight but now the plastic is no longer clear.  Therefore it doesn't work well for taking pictures. Also, it cannot be used with bigger phones that have a case. You have yo remove the case. I have a Samsung 6 galaxy  with an otterbox"
-1,"Top poo art broke after two weeks. I taped it and added padding,  they still work.  Cheap made. Covers over the speaker come off too easy.  Elecronic parts are great, but the build quality is poor.  Amazon basics for $14. Are far better.  I just got them and was shocked.  Cord on this is rubber feeling . Goos.  Overall do not buy.  Better ones for under $20."
1,Wonderful quality...
1,It worked great
1,Great product and cheap price. Nice protection.
1,Even though it takes a long time to arrive I really liked the case it was just what I wanted thank you.
1,Arrived quickly and works great.
1,"The installation was easy and the case provides great protection! You will NOT find a better case at this price, bar none. The kickstand is a nice bonus, though I rarely use it."
1,It is a great motivator.  Works terrific.
0,the hard plastic did not match with the rubber it was a little off its place.
1,"So far so amazing , phones a great buy.. A lot of people are complaining about the screen and speaker ... Screen is great and speaker is actually louder than I thought"
-1,This doesn't even deserve 1 star. This is by far the worst product I have ever bought. These do not work at all and even worse the prongs have broke off all 5 cables that came with the order. Don't waste your money!!
0,"Works great, but if you let it get hot the plastic circle will warp and the suction cup won't stick anymore. Definitely use a sunshade."
1,Sound good but it said set of two but only got one :/ But amazing soind
-1,"weak quality, chinese...."
1,Works great! Even matches my interior accents
0,I cannot get this to work. it is made of great quality and I truly do love the feel of it however........I absolutely can not get it to work no one can.<br />tried to contact seller.<br /> I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review! All opinions are 100% my own!
0,I like it. Comfortable and easy to use.
1,A very solid case. Offers comprehensive protection of the device. Match all the colors by exchangeable back.
1,"OtterBox.  Always a great option. Defender is bulky, but worth protection."
-1,Stopped working in less then a month.  Too late to return to amazon.  Now I have to ship it back to garmin with prepaid postage for them to ship me a new one.  BOO!
1,Even better than I expected... and fast delivery.
1,"Really well done, especially considering the price. Watch holds well. Nice stand for iphone six. Stable. Looks good. Surprisingly inexpensive."
1,"works great, and provides enough power for everything I power with it."
1,Nice case. Good material. Phone still retains a good feel. It also comes with a screen protector so the phone feels like it is shielded well.
-1,"I'm unable to get this thing to charge any of my phones.  Since I made the mistake of throwing away the packaging, I'm stuck with this POS.  I got curious and opened it up.  If the coils are placed directly against the back of a phone, it will charge, but assembled normally, it won't charge.  The fatal flaw of this thing is that it's really bad at detecting when a Qi device is near either of the coils.  With the unit disassembled and the coil directly against the back of a phone, the charging rate is comparable to other Qi chargers... but this is of no use when the unit can't detect a Qi enabled phone in normal operation."
-1,Cheaply made and a poor fit.
1,Great backup for when AC isn't available. This battery will recharge an iphone6+ several times. It is heavy.
-1,i thought it was a phone i was buying but it don't have any up to date functions on it i would have sent it back but my daughters boyfriend wanted it i don't know for what though it don't do anything
1,I'm not really into headphones so much but really needed something that I could use while I'm at work. (Complicated job --- can use cell while working but must be hidden!) I like to not only listen to music while working but to be able to answer calls in case I am needed! These did the trick! im<br />I was so happy they came with multiple ear pieces for comfort! And the sound was seriously amazing. (I work at a grocery store and it tuned out ALL the noise of people!!!)<br />You would think &#34;where do I charge these?&#34; But it's right ln the side of the ear bud. And also able to charge these portibly so that's awesome!<br />I can't say anything about the sweat and water resistance because I've never used them to that extent BUT they feel like they would live up to that!!<br />Shipping was FASTER than expected and I really love that! Also fit right in my mailbox. (EVEN BETTER! We live in apartments and our mailboxes are SMALL!!)<br />I was able to get this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review - and that is exactly what you've just read!!<br />Attached are photos of an earbud close up and the other is the whole product along with the charging cord attached!!
-1,The 2nd charging port just stopped working out of no where.  Terrible product
-1,I like the overall design of the case.  The kickstand folds out from the case in an a-frame design and seems to hold in place well.  I would like to see a higher quality material used to make the case so it is a little more  rugged.
1,the best
1,Love it! Very light and sturdy. I recommend
-1,i expected this to last longer but while functionality is still good... Product is definitely not any better than cheaper alternatives
1,Best case for Samsung phones! Amazingly low price and great quality.
1,Install was straight forward and worked well out of the box.  Many good videos on YouTube
0,"Have problems with some of the cords working between my iPhone and PC. Otherwise would have given 5 stars.  All cords worked fine for charging with Ac/Dc adaptors. Also fits very well with Otter waterproof cases!  HottCell C/S very good in replacing cords, and following up."
1,Good product charges great
1,"First let me say that the product works as advertised. Haven't had a problem with it since I received it.  The package came in two days. already impressed.  The product is right on spot when it comes to the description; adds grip to your phone, it's a snug fit, and a clear case for you to still appreciate the appearance of your Moto G (3rd generation) especially if you have used the Motorola website to customize the look of your phone.  *I have posted photos for reference: -The Cut out for the headphone port and microphone (found at the top of your phone) & the charging port (found at the bottom of your phone) are big enough so you won't have any problems using a 3rd party cable.  -there is a &#34;lay on the table&#34; feature so you can place your phone on a table with the screen faced down without scratching it. I would still recommend a screen protector for more protection.  -speaking of protection, this is a silicon based case, meaning your phone will most likely be protected from scratches and light bumps, not drops.  the only con I have with this is that the power and volume buttons are also covered as supposed to an open cut out so they are a bit hard to press. not a deal breaker though.  Overall, I like this case, and for the price; you really can't go wrong.  Highly recommended."
1,"This little connector worked perfectly for me as I replaced my 2003 Ford Explorer's factory radio for a brand new, up to date radio. This connector is critical in allowing you to preserve your vehicle's factory radio wiring harness. Highly recommended."
1,My mom loves them since they orange and uses them everyday
1,It worked for me
1,"Excellent, perfect time.fast delivery"
1,Nice to have the buttons open very thin should offer some protection in minor drops.
-1,Piece of crap! Mine never worked.  What a waste of money. I followed the direction and it never worked at all.
0,great kit and cheap! Tho the car charger no longer charges after 8 mos.
-1,Worked for about two months then the cord started to pop out of the nylon and broke from there.
1,"I like this case, this is the second one I've purchased (the first was for the iPhone 6 and this one is the six plus).  Although the product details do not make this claim, I have dropped the phone repeatedly without damage.  The color is exact (I'm viewing it from an old iPad).  The case allows my phone to still be slim and fit into my wallet.  I will purchase again."
1,Protects the phone good and realy nice case
1,LOVE IT!
1,Charges your equipment fast and always have an outlet to plug into
1,Good product. at a good price.
1,Good product
1,Got this for my boyfriend.  He loved it.  He is an auto mechanic so the case had to be tough to withstand being at his job.  It's been a month and the case still looks brand new
-1,"No, not for your wrists! (box cutter or razor blade!)<br /><br />While the colour of this case is fabulous you will not be able to pull down the top of your phone's screen. If you're sick of whatever you have there then this may be the case for you. Unless you feel like attempting to cut a strip about the thickness of a penny off the top of the snap-on cover piece. I myself am not fond of working with very sharp objects in small places. Especially when it's likely to leave a sharp edge. Though...  I do have lots of bandaids at home. But bloody fingers is really not a fashion statement that would work for me.<br />Oh wait! I almost forgot. If you want an impact resistant case this is not for you either. Unless you are feeling your phone is a despicable device you wish you'd never bought. Smashing it should be easy.<br />My case is going back."
1,Nice and smooth~~
0,"This earplug not meet my expectation, I just used a couple of time"
1,Excellent charger.  Fast.
1,"For the money very functional, with the foot lengths very useful for nightstand and other hard to reach places. A bit long for connecting to computer but nothing a tie-wrap won't fix."
1,Worked as described.  Holds charge all day.
1,Pro:<br />1. Can store up to 5 cards<br />2. Chain is a great accessory to have<br />3. Great quality case<br />4. Lighter than my other cases<br /><br />Con:<br />1. Card storage beside the magnet isn't recommended for use (It stretches the leather)<br />2. Card storage inside the case is uncomfortable to use<br />3. Uncomfortable to use back camera for pictures<br />4. The ring may be heavier than expected.<br /><br />Updated 10/02/2015
-1,It is big no doubt but the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired.
-1,The Infinim is the second pair of LG Tones I've owned. I was super excited about the new design and Harman Kardon sound experience. I am so disappointed. My original tones sound way better with a richer and louder sound. I have to keep these and my device turned almost all the way up to hear music decently. I have tried adjusting the audio settings with no resolve. These are basically good for calls only. In no way are these worth the price tag. You are paying for the cool look and the retractable cord option only on these.
1,I have used his case since prime day and it has held up amazingly. I have dropped my phone and it has been well protected and the case looks as good as new. I love always having my ID and CC close. Only thing that would make it better is if it was easier to open and close the case. It gets stuck closed and makes it difficult to open at times- often when there is a line behind me. If there was a button or latch that would make it more user friendly.
1,Works great.
1,love it..its hard case and its nice..high quality...got discount for my honest review
1,great case works as expected
-1,I purchased two of these. Neither of them stay clicked in nicely like the original one that came with my phone. They constantly fall out while charging. It leaves me to believe that these are not authentic Samsung products.
0,There are certainly better ones out there but for the price this one is not bad
1,Works well. As described
-1,"Bought this after Studio Energy.... no update, no customer response. My advice no more business for Blu from me."
1,Very dependable case
1,"Just got a new iPhone 6 and had to replace all of my old power cords for my 4S. Needed multiple cords to stage in car, office, bedroom, etc, etc. I tried multiple other vendors but was shocked to see how almost all of them didn't work or failed shortly after I got them. Tech Armor you can tell is of much greater quality. It's used in my office through my desk and gets yanked and stretched daily, but is the best cord I have. Highly recommended."
0,"Sound quality is fine.  Doesn't have a volume control on cord.  Minor, but given list price is listed as $100 this feature would be expect.  Biggest issue is that cords make a rumbling sound when they brush against shirt.  Big issue if listening to quite music."
-1,For some reason it keeps getting moisture inside the tube. I work inside a constant 70 - 72 degree building / jail. I then have to take it off for the rest of the day till I get compressed air and blow it out.
1,Great product. Fits like a glove. Remember it is for the ballistic version only.
-1,It did not work !!!
1,"Now my band stats in , finally!!!!"
1,"very durable. i also get many compliments<br />the front lower-right brand label thing is actually a sticker, so i removed mine"
1,"This watch is very nice. It is a show off watch, but if you want something fancy do not get it because it is more of the every day type in a fancy restaurant type."
1,Ideal headphones for toddlers. Highly recommended.
1,this is one hell of a item i gain so many memories and even shared it with my brother who love to travel he took it on a trip to a huge water park in florida and captured a nice shot of mom and dad.
1,"Previously I was one to spend $10+ on a glass screen protector, but when I went through them every couple months I decided to go a cheaper route. I spent $5 on this phone case and it is honestly works just as good as any $10 screen protector. I think I actually prefer this one more! I will continue to buy this screen protector. This is a good product and it is money well spent."
1,Good product. Good for the price and for its purpose
1,Great price and shipped early. The only problem I've encountered is the wire casing came out from under the phone charging end cap. Still works great so I'm not complaining.
1,Good quality
1,Was a gift for my daughter and she loved it
-1,It is No new battery. Used. See metal connect.
1,Amazing
0,"The Vysk charging case for the iPhone 6 has 4 main attributes (style, privacy, charging, protection) that I'll review separately. I did not use any of the apps associated with Vysk, so I'll ignore those entirely.<br /><br />Styling: The case is very attractive with small chrome accents and a pleasant texture that gives just enough grip so that the phone doesn't feel like it will slip out of your hand. Overall very classy.<br /><br />Privacy: The main reason to consider buying this phone is its camera privacy feature. The slider at the back of the phone engaged easily and never opened accidentally. I love this feature and wish every phone case had this. Outstanding.<br /><br />Charging: If you're knowledgable enough about potential smartphone exploits to be concerned about camera privacy, then you probably realize using an encrypted VPN (at all times) is even more important. And that uses even more power from your phone, hence the need for extra power. But the charging capability of this phone is just ok. I don't like the fact that the case had to be fully charged before it would charge the phone via the power cord. The charger is better than nothing, but a disappointment if you are used to Mophie or Otterbox chargers.<br /><br />Protection: This is the biggest flaw, in my opinion. The case slips on very easily, in fact, too easily. The Mophie case slips on in a very similar way, but is a much tighter fit. This helps when you drop the phone. My phone flew out of the Vysk case when it dropped from a &#34;normal&#34; fall onto concrete. The case seams also appear to be starting to separate after the fall. Ultimately, after closely examining my Vysk, my wife's Mophie, and my son's Otterbox Resurgence, it is clear the  quality of manufacturing is lower with the Vysk.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'll be switching to the Otterbox Resurgence (harder on/off, but doesn't come off when you drop it). The lack of camera privacy shutters really bothers me after enjoying the heightened privacy bar with Vysk. However, I look forward to seeing if Vysk will match the quality construction of Mophie and Otterbox in the future, as well as attaining a better internal grip of the phone. It's a good start, nevertheless."
1,This is my second Maxboost case.  The first case was with my iPhone 6 which it is still in use after 9 months.  I got this case to go on my work phone which is a 5S.  It fits perfectly and really looks good.  You can't go wrong with this case.
1,"It reminds me of the material used around the Gorilla cases built to protect your phone, which makes me think it can take some abuse. "
-1,1*
1,Number 1
1,Really like these covers easy to put on.. Just make sure u get them on right the first time.. They don't do so well if u have to pull them up..but they work very well.
1,Good case. Good material
1,i love it  i have had it for 2 weeks now and it has not faded like others state here i guess its just how u takr care of it
0,"Got very quickly, love the phone<br />After using this phone for awhile, I find that it's difficult to access the sd card, I tried rooting it, and found thru much research that the boot loader is locked and it's impossible to root. Also I can't use it as a hot spot. Also, it losses files. I went to Africa and, on a horse riding trail,  filmed a family of giraffes about 75 feet away. I showed it to all my fellow riders, and when I went to share it, it's completely gone.<br />So I don't love this phone so much."
1,"Works great, had no issues  installation."
1,"I like this it works great and holds my IPhone 6 Plus however I think the phone is to heavy for the ball and socket connection as it is continuously falling forward, I am going to try to enlarge the ball by putting some electric tape around it as it is just loose enough that it is a nuisance when I am riding my bike, I would recommend it but be aware the ball and socket may not be strong enough to hold the larger phones up"
1,"I just received this product 2 days ago and I finally have a chance to use it today. The materials seems so-so, fitting with the price. The color is more of jet black rather than a gunmetal gray, which is to be expected. It still looks better on my gunmetal sport watch than the apple official milanese loop band since the official version only comes in gray. The magnet seems strong and would last for a while. What bothers me is that the band does not fit my 42mm Sport Edition gunmetal watch that I specifically order (see pictures). Luckily, my wife the 38mm and I put it on her watch and it fits it perfectly. I deduced that they sent me the wrong version (38mm) without checking prior to shipment. Who is in charge of quality assurance? I would not be surprised if all previous reviewers who received the band with a gap also received the wrong 38mm version. So either: 1) it was an accidental shipping error where a 38mm band was shipped instead of the 42mm or 2) the seller falsely claimed that they produce a 42mm but they really don't. I read at least one reviewer who mentioned that he received the band without a gap so I assume that there are 2 versions produced. I have submitted for a return request so let's see how the seller will respond and I will keep this review updated accordingly.  REVIEW UPDATED 9/10/2015 Seller promptly responded back to me and offered to replace with the correct 42mm black milanese loop. For my trouble, I asked the seller to send me a silver 38mm Milanese loop for my wife silver Sport band and the seller agreed to send it for free. A week later, I received both bands and they fit both the 42mm and 38mm really well. The 42mm is ever slightly larger than the watch connector but you can only see this if you closely examined it. To the standard observer, it fits perfectly. The 38mm band fits the 38mm sport watch perfectly. My wife loves it! The materials seem durable and the magnet is surprisingly strong. I would highly recommend purchasing the Milanese loop from Kartice due to the excellent customer service and the great value that you get from these Milanese loop."
-1,"I placed my phone in this case, a couple of weeks later I removed the top part in order to clean my phone and the entire screen came off with it. Would not purchase again. iPhone 5S."
1,Very happy with the quality and sound! Great value!
1,Kind of a loose fit but otherwise ok.
1,This case fits like a glove.  Very nice!
1,Excellent product .
1,"The only reason it's a 4 star rating because my cable failed after just two months, but I'm able to return it back for refund. I'm still an anker fan. I think I may have received the defective one."
1,So I lost the back of my phone and decided to use this to replace it (I know its not a replacement) and it fit perfectly! Plus it has some awesome grip texture on it! I love it! And the design is awesome two ;)
1,Great basic speaker - love that I can use as both a light and the blu-tooth speaker. LED color is a very cool white (blue) so used more for speaker! Teen actually stole mine - this has been a hit for all ages. I received this at a deeply discounted price for my honest opinion.
1,"These are awesome. They really give that Xtra kick, nice clean sound. The way they are designed make them hard to damage with sound like other speakers. I'm looking for the other 2 from the from of my car now....."
1,Disclaimer: I received a discount for writing a review of this product. Arrived promptly and was easy to use. I've only been using it a short time but it has protected my screen as advertised.
-1,"I got mine really fast. Its not what i expected it to be, it does not covers the top and the bottom fully, i mean it does not covers the headset jack or the microphone neither the USB connector, it is only covers the left and right side of the phone, and on the right side it covers around the power and volume buttons."
1,Definitely protects. I've dropped my phone few times and it's safe. It is bulky so some may not like that feature. I don't mind
1,Phone fits Tight and sung
1,No issues
1,Very cute!
1,"I loved it, it arrived on time and fit my phone perfectly, the colors are right and it's exactly like the picture. 10/10 would recommend"
0,"The BEBONCOOL USB Magnetic Charging Cable is a cheap alternative to the genuine Sony charging dock. While it functions properly, the indicator light on the cable seems unnecessary since the Xperia Z3 Compact already has a charging indicator light. I have covered up the light on the cable with electrical tape for the time being since it is extremely bright and flickers rapidly between blue and red when the phone is nearing a complete charge.<br /><br />The cable itself is of moderate quality. It retains the shape from the packaging and is difficult to route efficiently behind my desk. This cable would be good to use when traveling since it is more portable than the genuine Sony charging dock, but it leaves a lot to be desired as a primary charger."
0,"Loved it at first, big fancy looking phone. Takes great pictures. Plenty of storage space. I love Google so androids are my go to phones. Only problem after owning it less than two months, I dropped it and the screen cracked some. I thought that's ok I'll just have to use it with a few cracks. When I tried to unlock the phone, the touch wouldn't work! Turns out the screen digitizer and LCD are fused and would need a new set of those all together. Needless to say I bought a cheaper phone instead of paying $145 to get it fixed. That's more than I paid for the phone! Awesome phone but once it cracks 😭 P.S. My hubby also had one and cracked just by sitting on it in his pocket. Crack was barely visible and it stopped working as well."
1,"I like this phone case because it's very sleek. I hope that it is shock absorbant as advertised, seems a bit stiff. otherwise great product."
-1,This product is not for a Samsung note 3
-1,just junk.
-1,more than 30% shows wrong address or navigation path
1,Great product. Earpieces could have more sizes to fit.
-1,"Obviously not apple earbuds, mic is terrible"
1,quality was good works as i was expecting<br />image quality was nice ill give it 8/10 for quality
0,Okay..not bad
1,Great case for my active lifestyle. Fit my s6 active perfectly.
1,"Perfect case, looks just like the image. There are two card slots on the inside along with one cash slot. Fit my phone perfectly (:"
-1,Doesn't transmit audio
-1,IT TOOK ELEVEN DAYS TO GET HERE AND WHEN INSTALLED WAS DIFECTIVE AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE A REPLACEMNT
1,"Very nice, sturdy case. Love the strap. Keeps me from dropping phone. Wish it had a slot for a stylus."
1,Works great and gives me the info I need while fishing. I wanted a transducer up front where I was. My console sonar uses a transducer on the transom.
0,Would have preferred that the protection screen was on when it arrived and the speaker protective grill wasn't on so I had to get it fixed
0,This is a nice buy but it isn't the color that is shown in the picture. It's more or a light blue not mint. But it came really quick and I will still be using it.
1,Very tough. Very good screen protector. Quick shipping and reasonable price. Thank you !
-1,I have had this phone a little over a year and it will not hold a charge.  Junk!
1,"Part 1:<br /><br />Previous batteries that were cheap OEM knock offs would get really hot when the GPS was in use and battery life would suffer. The reviews on Anker looked promising so I decided to try one for myself.<br /><br />I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S4 version and it arrived today. Compared to the OEM battery it's a tad bit thicker but the battery cover snaps on easily.<br /><br />It registered a 40% charge out of the box, which is perfect for storage. Enclosed documentation stating Anker has a very high interest in customer satisfaction was a nice touch. It included a toll free support number.<br /><br />The literature states 500 charge cycles, so it should be able to hold a full charge for at least a year. Many manufactures don't publish this information and if it does hold for the full 500, that would put it on par with actual OEM quality at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />No issues with heat or charge duration within the first day of use (it seems to be the same as OEM,) so I'll post back.<br /><br />Part 2:<br /><br />It's been three weeks and I noticed that it consistently holds a charge equivalent to the original Samsung battery. For me, that's about 14 hours of moderate usage with low signal strength. The battery doesn't get as hot as the cheap $5 replacements, which is really nice. It still heats up when the processor is working hard, but it's just warm and doesn't feel like it's going to explode at any moment.<br /><br />Edit 3:<br /><br />I noticed the battery was only holding 70% of its original charge so I contacted customer service. They promptly addressed my concerns and the battery was replaced under warranty. Very impressive customer service!"
1,It works also and love it very much
1,Perfect addition to our bike rides.
0,I found it quite cumbersome when using the belt attachment to answer a phone call.Consequently  I don't use it
-1,Rubber falls apart
1,"The biggest complaint I hear about this product is that it's ugly and uncomfortable...Neither are true! It's extremely comfortable on my wrist and with the adjustable strap, it's perfect! I got my package yesterday and immediately opened it, charged it, and put it on! I'm in love with this fitness tracker already. Great accuracy with step tracker, calorie burn, and so much more. As a previous owner of the Nike Fuel band I was skeptical of anything else but so glad my Fuel band broke and I got to purchase this! Microsoft is stepping up in the world!"
1,My bf love it
-1,I loved the color and the fit but they just didn't stay connected. I ended up sending them back and getting something else. It's a pain in the rear to be running and having your music constantly cutting out.
1,These replacement charging port covers are excellent quality and fit perfectly.
-1,Wasn't satisfied with the product
1,Love the case and ETA was earlier the stated. Do will order from this seller again.
1,I have used for over 3 months.  It works very well great picture.  You will need a high capacity SD card
1,"What can you say, it works like the case idea. I have a spare battery and this keeps it charged. I rarely use the cord that plugs into the phone for charging."
0,It was good but case is almost as slippery as phone is.
1,Speakers sound great and look awesome!
1,"This is a great case ! Received it today and am very pleased with the quality. It is probably a better case than ones I've seen in Walmart and target for 4 times the price. Well worth the money spent. I would certainly recommend to anyone. As for anyone saying it makes the phone bulkier, not really. It's a big phone. If you think the case makes it to bulky then you should have gotten a smaller phone."
1,"Finn is a fantastic product for mounting your phone to your bike. I've been cycling seriously for fitness, commuting and travel for over 30 years and there have been so many exciting changes in cycling technology in that time. One of the most exciting and most recent has been the ability to use a smartphone as a cycling computer. Finn is the simplest, easiest to use, and best solution I have found to mount my NEXUS 5 to each of the three bikes I ride. I have used the Finn for months with no signs of wear to it or my phone. While I originally thought the Finn might break my phone in half, it really does a great job of holding the phone very securely without applying damaging pressure. It is very easy to read the various cycling all's I have used as well as other apps like Google maps for turn-by-turn directions - a real joy on camping trips in new places! My only problem with the Finn is that I lost my first one and had to live without it for a week. There are other solutions out there. Many are more expensive, require tools, add weight, leave plastic mounts on your bike and/or phone, can only be used with one bike, cause your phone to overheat, etc. Finn is the way to go."
-1,"This product did everything it was advertised to do, I just didn't care for it because it was so bulky. I purchased it for a lengthy road trip, but actually ended up purchasing a different product after one day of use."
-1,Sucked didn't fit at all dont buy it!
1,"This case fits the OnePlus One phone perfectly.  I think that it will protect the phone in the event of it being dropped, which is why I purchased it.  (I hope not to find out if it will, I hope I will not drop it!!)  Following the directions, the case is easy to install, and the screen saver protects from scratches to the screen.  The only issue that I have experienced is a relatively minor one, but is a little frustrating.  The hinged snap in protector for the charging port does not easily &#34;snap&#34; into place, and pops open too often, especially when moving the phone into or out of your pocket, for example. It is a good value, but it would be nice if the port cover would work correctly."
1,"For the price, I can't believe how long it's lasted me already! Easy to use. Works great!"
1,"The case fits really well, and it seems durable. The matte looks just like the picture, which is great!! Im in love with the case!!! I have an HTC one remix by then way."
1,Works as advertised.
1,Just got mines today and it's great. Better than what I expected. Will be buying more of these soon. Thank you so much.
1,This charger is awesome it charges my phone super fast and it's not gigantic so it's portable. Really recommend this charger. I have an S6 and anyone who has one knows the batter sucks. But this charges it up pretty fast.
1,I bought a second one of these as a gift.  It has all the features I like.
-1,"I purchased this for a Samsung Note 3 which has a low profile case. It's just too gooey and the slot is too short to hold a bigger phone. The phone falls every time I turn a corner but the pad stays on the dash without sliding around. I wouldn't use this to hold my phone face up on the dash because we get a lot of sun in our area and it would probably fry my phone.<br />It works great to hold my husbands iPhone 5s, my sunglasses and other items and if that's what I had purchased it for I would give it a 4."
1,"Really nice earphones for only $20. I can actually hear the bass with these, and there's excellent sound isolation. The only thing is that the one I received has a straight plug, while in the pictures it's bent"
1,"The product work great, glad I bought this product"
-1,Good thank
-1,My fault for buying a hard case. It lasted about 5 months. I dropped my phone in the kitchen and the case cracked. Do yourself a favor and get a rubber or silicone case.
-1,Cannot charge with it . For some reason does not charge
1,I love it 💜 great case with a great clear image fits snug on my phone.what u see is what u get
-1,Doesn't work on my 3 year old I docks
1,"Works exactly as it should.  indicator light let's you know when it's done charging,  and charging a dead battery only takes about 5-6 hours. I haven't had a problem yet,  after 3 weeks of everyday use"
1,Easy to apply.
1,Works as intended. Can't ask for more.
1,"My husband has two devices that he carries with him at all times his iPhone and his portable speaker. He was always getting the two charging cables tangled up in his car so this ended up working perfect for him. When he needs the micro USB charger he can just use it on this one and when he needs to switch to the Lightning adapter he can as well with no issue.<br /><br />The cord itself is flat and holds up well to being slammed in between the arm rest and the little compartment. It hasn't bent or torn so far.<br /><br />He also loves how the cord is black and the metal is tinted dark on it, he says it matches his car :)<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
1,Charges fast as earlier posts had indicated. It's now the only charger I use when travelling in my vehicles.
-1,There's a lot of good reviews for the suede leather band so I made the purchase. However the black leather band looks cheap flimsy. I think it's far the from quality of the apple leather band that I tried on.
1,"I have used so many car-phone mounts that I should have 1 on every window in my car... I even use them in my house while cooking and even on the nightstand next to my bed. I like this one because it gives you the convenience of having your phone within eye shot without having to disrupt your view of the road. There are already way too many distractions to add one more just to hold your phone.<br /><br />It came with several different rubber pieces to use on the part that actually goes into your CD player, depending on the thickness of the CD opening. Though the instructions for this product didn't really make it clear what those pieces were for. There was only 1 place on the box that showed the different sizes. I do like this product and will continue to use it as I like the fact that it's not an additional distraction on the windshield but I wished the screen on my stock radio was in a different place. It only blocks a part of the display but I don;t think it will be like that in most vehicles.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this product!<br /><br />*I was given this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion*"
1,"i received this product in exchange for an unbiased review the shipping was fast and the package was secure and safe, no broken parts made of durable materials easy to install with clear instructions fits my Iphone 6+ perfectly doesn’t interfere with the camera all ports and speakers work perfectly stylish. It is thin and lightweight but very good protector i have dropped my phone quite a few times and i also keep in a large purse, my phone is very safe and well protected"
1,Good quality
1,Awesome product.  Fits and looks great!
1,It worked great on a trip out of the country - allowed recharges during the day while on buses or at lunch.
1,"Camera works great! I hard wired it into my truck, which I highly recommend. It goes on and off with the ignition, so there's no worries about forgetting to turn it on. I have piece of mind knowing if one of those annoying bicycle riders tries to ride under the front of my truck again, Ill have it &#34;on tape&#34;."
1,It is working well.
1,It was just what I wanted!  Very well made!  Thank you so much.  Pam Fink
1,"Fast shipping, and product was exactly as advertised."
-1,"When you put these covers on, you can't charge the phone. :-("
-1,"This ruined the battery of my phone, it overheated and I can no longer use my phone. I would give it zero stars."
0,It's ok but it doesn't hold itself vertically with a phone on it. I have to rest it on my dashboard
1,Very nice.
1,"I used to have an Otterbox for my phone, but the problem was it was a black case and was CONSTANTLY losing my phone. This case it 100% comparable to the Otterbox I had and for less than half the price when I purchased it. Also, I don't lose my phone anymore because it's neon green!"
0,"Smaller than expected, not much memory."
1,It is and awesome screen proctect and it says that it has a life time warrenty. I cant find out how to send it back. I just cracked my screen and i need to send it back. They need to make it easier to send it back
1,"Awesome cover.  I got this for my 13year old for Iphone 5s.  For myself I am a HTC fan and have had cases for HTC M7 and M8.  SPECK is the only phone cover I will ever buy.  If SPECK doesn't make a cover for the phone, I'm not buying the phone is how strong I feel about the quality of SPECK covers.  The phone honestly will bounce with the cover on, without doing any damage to the phone.  It has a slight lip that is slightly higher than the glass so not matter how the phone falls the phone is protected.'<br /><br />The color in the picture is the color of the case that we received.

-1,"The iPhone came defective. The Wi-Fi adapter is not working, so I tried to contact Apple but they could not help. This was a bd gift for a relative but when the day of the bd came and the iPhone was opened it was already too late for a return or refund. The iPhone was returned to me and well, the seller deserves less than one start for messing up a special birthday present."
1,Very good mount so far.  Sticks to my textured dash very solid.  Fits my note 4 easily.
1,Works as it should
-1,Didnt fit
1,Very good
1,"I really like this camera the screens is nice and big compared to other dash cams. It comes with everything you need to use it. A suction cup and bracket to hook it to the windshield, a plug to charge it, I suggest you leave it plugged in all the time because it kind of dies quickly. It does not come with the micro sd card so it needs one. There are tons of settings, on it you can record for 2, 5 or 10 minutes at a time or whatever you like. After it records so many times it will record over the old recordings and does it again and again and again. What I really like about this is that I can aim it in any direction or angle I want it's very versatile on the bracket that holds it."
-1,"Great charger,  but first few hours the led display,  the center line across the led will no longer light up. *update* Parts of the display do not light up anymore. When I got a call about thfae product, I told them of the issue but they would not do anything for me. If you call to check then do something to fix the problem.,"
0,"Works fine, as advertised. However, even with the smallest rubber earpiece, the headset still hurts my ear canal after a short while. I need to find a smaller or more contoured Bluetooth headset.  Also, packaging appeared to be previously opened and rifled-through. I'd guess that this headset had been returned by a previous buyer.  UPDATE: The seller contacted me and has provided me with a different headset for me to test out. Good response and service."
1,"Great lil' speaker. Sound is really good for the size and price. Works great on my back deck when streaming music thru my phone. No issues as of yet with the Bluetooth connectivity not working and it synced up in a snap. Actually like the fact the volume is controlled only by the phone, and it is plenty loud enough. Great product so far."
0,It's pretty and it has grip but it's cheap so it's cracking.
1,Great case! My heart rate monitor has had a long life since I bought this case for the watch and the monitor strap.
1,"I bought this for the Honor X2 made by Hauwei. It arrived before the scheduled date so the shipping is expedient.<br /><br />The case also comes with a screen protector. That is good in case the one already on the X2 becomes damaged. Be sure to look closely at the X2 screen, it comes with a factory installed screen protector so don't add another on top of it.<br /><br />The back of the case is real leather, a sample patch is attached so you can see that. I noticed that the corner of the leather back near the camera cutout was peeling off. It isn't a big deal to put some glue on it but something the manufacturer should pay some attention to.<br /><br />To install the case. slide the leather cover downward so that you have two pieces, the back and the metal surround. Insert the X2 with the side buttons portion going in first followed by the opposite side. Then slide the leather back cover in. The case does what it says and is very stylish and provides a nice grip. It makes the X2 look very high end.<br /><br />Here are the issues though and for me it is a deal breaker sorry to say:<br /><br />1. Any case will increase the bulk of a phone but with the X2 aleady being on the large side, the extra bulk is just enough to make it too large for me to carry around. It isn't that it doesn't fit into pockets, it still does but it just is a bit too large to hold. I don't say this is the fault of the case, all cases will make whatever they hold larger. Just keep this in mind. If you use the X2 differently, say carry it in a purse or something like that and primarily use it as a tablet instead of a phone for making calls, that extra size is just a bit too much.<br /><br />So #1 applies only to me.<br /><br />#2 though is hard to deal with. I noticed that the X2 gets better reception without the case than with it. I use T-Mobile and can consistently get very fast 3G speeds, so good that for practical purposes, 4G isn't any faster or doesn't make a real life difference. Perhaps itis the metal used in the frame but the instant I take the case off the 3G reception gets much better. I don't know where the antennas for the X2 are placed but this is something I noticed.<br /><br />I must say though, since the Honor X2 is designed for the Asian market, this reception issue might not happen in locations where 4G works with the X2. Since I am using the X2 in the USA and get 3G service with it, that might be the problem. If you are in a location where the 4G frequencies work with the X2, then you might not experience this problem.<br /><br />In summary, I chalk this up to 1-personal preference and 2-my location which is not where the X2 was designed to operate. I point these things out because some people like me are buying the Honor X2 for the US market.<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars because the design of the case is nice, it is well made except for that one small issue which could be isolated to my one example."
1,"POSITIVE:<br />* Works well on Verizon.  The nano SIM from my Verizon iPhone 6 works perfectly with this Nexus 6.  I have the XT1103 version purchased from Amazon.  The product description incorrectly states that it doesn't work on Verizon.<br />* GPS navigation works well using Nokia HERE maps while offline (on airplane mode while location services is on).<br />* Quick charger works well and is fast.<br />* Vanilla Android.<br /><br />NEGATIVE:<br />* Curved back is comfortable for holding with one hand, but it makes it less stable in car phone carriers.<br />* Battery life is short.  Good thing the quick charger works well.  You should also get a good vehicle quick charger (e.g., Anker PowerDrive+ 1).<br />* Android is still not as smooth functioning as iOS. This is not Nexus 6 specific, but it's still worth noting."
1,"I've been using this daily. I replaced all the separate chargers on my desk with this USB charger. It does get a bit warm when I have 3 tablets all charging at once,but so dar so good. I like its compact size and the way it stands vertically and the power led indicating its on.. I am curious as to know long it will last given how warm it gets. I will update if it has any problems, but happy so far."
1,💯
1,"Great little gadget and incredibly affordable. Have used it for a month now, and my phone fell off it once which was likely due to my poor placement of my phone in aligning the magnet. Super easy to install, remove, and use.  Not bulky or ugly like other more expensive grippy ones. Totally awesome & would recommend!"
-1,Didn't like it at all
-1,"The one I got looked different then the picture. I though the case was gonna be black. It was a clear, thin plastic that felt like it was going to break when I tried to put it on. The print of the case looked old and discolored. The while lettering looked yellow. Was very disappointed with this case."
0,not so clear
1,Very easy to use!
1,Very durable
1,It's good.
1,Great product
-1,Broke after having it for 2 days
1,Very good case long lasting
1,"Daughter loves it, uses with IPhone 6"
1,"I love this case! It is a light and durable minimalist case. The orange trim is fun, and the clear back really highlights the elegance of your iPhone without covering it. The material is very grippy, so I never feel like my phone will slip out of my hand. There is sufficient coverage around the entire face of the phone (no corners uncovered) so if I set it down face-first the case (and possibly my screen protector) are the only points touching. I gave it 4 stars only because the edge of the case separated along the back of the phone after many months of use. But I like the case so much that I ordered another one - same exact one and same exact color. I think it is good value for the money."
1,Get many compliments
1,LOVE IT!!!
1,"First rate product. Really useful and helps to keep clutter off the dashboard. Could not recommend the product or company to highly. Great service, great product."
1,"Came with various fittings to accommodate a  comfortable fit. They hold up on runs and workouts, and they've lasted me over 3 hours on a single charge. A little too much bass for my taste but it was still a great buy"
1,"I love this case. I have the black edged case for my white Note 4 and it's a perfect fit. I had a similar case for my Galaxy S4 in the past that had a rigid side edges for extra grip. I wish this case had that but that's me being nit picky. This case has protected my phone from a couple falls already.<br /><br />The Note 4 is pretty bulky to begin with in my opinion so I really wanted a case that didn't add to that preexisting bulk. This case does well. After about 10 months of use, it still holds up great."
-1,Ok
1,Very practical.
0,"Nice looking, delivered as stated...but I bought two and both insides plastic holder didn't hold up more than a couple weeks of wear."
1,Tabs break easy
1,"It's a really good case, and pretty tough I've dropped it a few times so I know this to be true. A little difficult to remove again though."
1,Works great! I love the smart output feature. I bought the case with it and it's just what I was looking for. Great price and quality.
1,"Great fit, just like all the paat Spigen products I've ordered. This case has been protecting my phone for over four months now and haven't had any issues. I do construction so the phone has been put through a lot. Drops, falls, being stepped on and dust. Thus cast has protected it perfectly. Cannot go wrong with Spigen if you're looking for a less bulky case than Otter Box."
1,"This pouch clips securely onto my belt with no problems at all. You can even run your belt thru the extra belt loops for added security. I have no issue removing my phone from this pouch or putting it back in. Some reviews say the naked iPhone is too big for this pouch, which is true, but it clearly says on the description of this product that you need a defender or commuter case. I have a Speck case on my 5s with a little wiggle room inside the pouch, but it's not a deal breaker for me. Good product, buy it."
1,"Great case at a great value!  Slimmer than the Otterbox case, but just as protective.  Some slight rainbow effect from screen saver, but you can only see it when the screen is off.  Rainbow is not visible when the screen is on."
-1,Cracked within the first 3 days.
-1,was not the best quality
1,I really like this case! The kick stand is a little cheap but I don't think I'll use it anyways. The case seems really protective and has a high lip around the screen.
1,Very happy with my purchase
1,"I love it! It was so easy to apply and you wouldn't even know there's a screen protector on it. I didn't even mess up on the first try (it comes with 3 sheets, so I have the other 2 for a far future). You may see some bubbles when you first apply it, but when you remove the top film (layer #2), the bubbles are gone! You hardly ever get smudges, and if you do, just blow out some of your breath on it, rub it with a soft cloth or your shirt and voila! Very sleek."
1,"After two days, cables seem well made and charge iPhone 5, 6, and iPad mini with no issues"
1,"This is my second purchase of the enviCar phone holder because I left the last one in the rental car, oops.  So this time I bought two so if I loose one and can use the second until my next order arrives.  I use my phone holder all the time staying cool and never falling down.  Thank you for a great product."
1,"A good product for the price, in fact quite good."
-1,No they gave out the second day
-1,"I was really excited about these when they arrived! They are very long. Right off the bat one didn't work, but I was so happy with the other two, I didn't complain. Shortly after I started using them another quit working, followed by the third. Don't waste your money on these!"
-1,Broke the first day followed instructions and everything. Inside snapped while adjusting to fit my phone. I do not recommend and request a replacement or refund!
1,Nice product
1,"Wow what a great thing.  We've replaced the battery in our car three times over the last six months (the car is a 2010 model).  The dealership couldn't find the cause and said the only thing they could think of was that the smart key was always communicating with the car so we needed to move the key further from the car when we're not driving.  We couldn't find anywhere in the house that there was no communication, so, in desperation, I ordered the signal blocking bag.  Works like a champ!  No signal even if we're in the car.  Amazing."
1,It is a very good product for the price.  I even brought one for my grand daughter and she love it. Easy to setup the Bluetooth.
-1,"Do not buy this. It has no provision to exchange neither the key blade nor the immobilizer pill, so it is utterly useless. I did get a refund, but then spent most of that on return shipping."
1,"Did all the prep work (clean, microfiber, dust removal) and this baby went on absolutely perfectly. Not a single bubble or speck of dust. Never had a screen protector apply itself so well. Also looks great and touch response is unaffected. Couldn't be happier."
1,the product is fine
-1,"Clip fit perfectly to case however, the clip is flimsy and fragile. It fell apart in about a week."
1,"Best lightning cable out there, This has traveled constantly over the last 13 months, still works perfectly.  I would call this super heavy duty."
-1,"The protection is great. Dropped my phone face down on concrete. The protective film cracked, but not my phone. Now my issue is the &#34;life time warranty&#34;, I've called and sent an email, no returned call, as the message says, and the email address is no good. So now what??perhaps this is the only way to get their attention. If there is a guarantee for replacement. I would like a replacement please."
1,"I ordered this as a back up case because I have had a phone case design peel off the plastic shell and I was nervous to get a new one from amazon, but I love my new case and the purple back up rubber case is exactly what I ordered."
1,I bought the wrong item product as offered
1,These cases are great. No they aren't durable BUT THEY WERENT MEANT TO BE. They are meant to be aesthetically pleasing. Besides its wood. It breaks when you drop it. It's a great if your in to cool different things.
1,I just got my case in the mail. The case does not add much bulk to the phone. Dust covers for headphone and power port are a plus. Screen protector for front and back are included. They are great quality. Just make sure phone surface is clean before applying screen protector.
-1,"Don't waste your time installed it right and followed instructions, now all i get is a beeping noise from phone. Waste of time and money. I want a refund but good luck getting that"
1,"Love the phone,  was every thing I heard. I would suggest you buy one. For the money, it will be hard to find better deal. One of best sounding I ever had."
-1,"NEVER buy this!!! If I could give it a zero, I would!  I have been through 3 of these protectors as they break easily. On my previous phone with a different protector I didn't have this problem EVER. The glass is so thick that you have trouble with connectivity and lose functionality of your phone on buttons that are located around the edge of your screen. Don't even think about purchasing....you will be unhappy."
1,It great
1,we used it on two recent trips.  lasts forever on one charge. we charged 2 iPads and 2 iPhones 3x...
1,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she really likes it.  The only complaint I've heard about it is that the magnet isn't super strong, though because you can hold credit cards, etc. in there, that's probably by intention.  Overall, she still really likes it after having used it for a month."
-1,Top skin came off wit first use of first two pens. OK as pens not good as a stylus
1,"I was initially unsure about buying a phone from anyone other than my carrier. I wanted this phone, however, and it was no longer available through my carrier. Amazon customer support helped me on the phone, making me feel 100% comfortable going outside my comfort zone. I LOVE my phone. It arrived in perfectly new condition, there were absolutely NO ISSUES. Thank you Amazon customer support!!"
1,"This would have gotten five stars if I could have used all four connectors, someone with A Galaxy 5 or Note will be surely give it 5 stars.  This one  cable charges my iPod, iPad 2. iPad mini 3. Small speaker, Dreds Bluetooth headphones.  It will charge two things at once, say an iPad and a headphones.  Two iPads won't charge at once, probably they take too much power.  The cord is long enough to make it easy to use.  This is a no brainier  I bought two, one for daily use and one for travel.  I should have bought more it would be handy to have one in the car and I'm sure my son will appropriate one if he gets a chance."
1,Nice slim design  and fits like a glove..
1,"rubber encasement is great for shock absorption, holster seems pretty sturdy."
1,a
1,"good grip, not too bulky, nice looking"
-1,Worked for one day then can't pair it anymore. Followed all the &#34;tips&#34; no help. Trying to find contact info is impossible...
-1,"After a month, heats up very hot and stops working."
1,"No problem!  I ordered it, got it in a timely fashion and that was all I needed."
1,Very good protector !! And seller !!
1,"The case is great but I wish that I could find it without the holster.  I bought a similar case without the holster for my iPhone 6+ Last November, bit I couldn't find it on Amazon when I went to find the same case for my wife's phone.  Regardless, the case is worth getting and just throwing away the holster, which I did."
1,"This cover fit my phone like a glove. It is slim, but not so thin that your phone would break if you dropped it. It is sleek but not slippery. I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion"
1,Really good one
-1,This screen protector does not fit iPhone 6 properly as described.<br />Not recommended.
-1,"These cords do NOT work. The charge light comes on initially, but immediately goes off. very disappointing."
-1,"POS that Amazon should be embarrassed to allow it to be listed for sale on their site.  Does not fit 04 Tacoma without cutting the dash due to the long depth in spite of being stated as &#34;fits your vehicle&#34; when make and model is entered in the pop up,  The calendar function day/date function is wrong which is amazing since that is the easiest module for a programmer to write, the clock refuses to maintain a time setting so the prominently displayed time is what ever it feels like displaying. The trim piece included wouldn't even fit the unit the injection molding was so bad.<br />Worst part is the seller Boss was totally unresponsive to submitted  questions regarding the programming flaws and then after four weeks had the gall to ask in a email how they were doing for customer service.<br /><br />The radio, backup camera input, and playing music files from the sd micro card did function.  If those are the only items you need and don't mind the wrong day-date and time being displayed you could take a chance on it how ever it may be doubtful you will get any  service if it blows out during the factory warranty period.  Take note some of the &#34;good&#34; reviews do not state they had installed it yet. Research it on the web at other locations before purchasing."
1,I didn't buy a screen protector because it said it came with one. But it didn't. Bummer
-1,This one Crashes often. Please see the attached pic..Also Slow response and also the pictures taken by both the cameras are of low quality .
-1,"The phone case itself is really pretty and protects my phone (iPhone 6) just fine. However I think the color is a little different from the picture. I believe the one I received is lighter pink. It is very slippery and slips from my hand very easily.It also got very dirty quickly and I could not clean it. Again, it does serve its purpose as a phone protector."
1,Works great
1,A solid choice to protect my S4. It makes the phone a bit bulkier than I would like but it is worth the trade off to avoid a damaged device. I don't use the belt clip as I find it too awkward. My only complaint is that I can't seem to get rid of a small amount of oil slick appearance caused by the integrated screen protector.
1,As advertised. Replacement cradle for Samsung Galaxy gear.
1,Works great and never falls out but anytime I move mty phone more than a few inches it cuts out for a second.
1,This is a great product. Easy to install and adjusts to fit all sorts of devices. My kids love not having neck ache at the end of long trips now. We have left it installed all summer without any issues.
1,"This is a great case for my son who loves anything white and basketball. In fact, it seems meant to be. I recently passed my iPhone 5 down to him and my feminine case wasn't going to do. This case was exactly what he wanted. I love this type of case (flexible) and it is the only kind I use. I believe the rubber absorbs the shock or any fall it may take."
1,"I got this case w/keyboard in the map design and I just love it. The wireless keyboard connects quickly and, even though it's small, has enough room to type easily.  I like the fact that it will connect with my iPhone as well. Since the keyboard is magnetic it removes from the case allowing you to use it anywhere. The case closes well around the iPad mini whether the keyboard is inside or not."
1,"I bought this when my last bluetooth gave up the ghost. The sound quality is great, it holds a charge longer than my last bluetooth, and it's very comfortable in my ear. I like it so much, I went to buy a 2nd one as backup... unfortunately, the price had almost DOUBLED. If the price goes back down, I'll buy another one. Otherwise, I'll just be happy using this."
-1,wrong this doesn't fit and itz not right.
1,Does exactly as stated.  My kids fight me for it.
0,"The charging cord broke within a week of using it.  It takes a long time to charge the charger back up, but it is good for numerous uses.  It tends to stop charging at random times at like 75% or 80% (doesn't always charge to full) even without running out of battery.  Basically, this is a good extra option."
1,"They work, they look good, they're NOT a right angle (which I dislike, so that's a pro! Haha) and they're simply cheap. A 3 pack of things that just work. I gave one to two of my friend's because they're cheap and I didn't need 3. It's just an easy buy. (:"
-1,"Stopped working after 2 months, will no longer charge iPad.  Pay the extra money and buy a better cable, Do not buy this item, it will be a waste of money."
1,Perfect!
1,This is very nice phone.  Works well and the price for a new one was very attractive
0,This screen protector includes the standard 9h glass that is expected of a glass screen protector.  The problem is that this screen protector only covers the lit portion of the screen.  This makes use of the phone very uncomfortable as the lip between the screen protector and the rest of he glass on the front of the phone is noticeable.
1,This seems to be really protect the phone.  I was very pleased.
1,"I personally don't own an iPhone 6+ (let alone any iPhone), but I bought this as a gift for someone who couldn't make up their mind about which case to get. That being said, they were naturally happy to receive this case because it afforded them the quality of an OtterBox case to an extent without costing as much. What makes this case even nicer, is that it has swappable plates so he can change it depending on his mood."
0,"Very nice design and feeling, but don't expect to be able to take it off without denting/ruining the phone"
-1,"Update: charging port broke. Can't charge the battery up anymore.  Wow this thing lasts awhile. the indicator lights are helpful, too. It's kinda bulky, but it's worth it for the amount of energy it holds"
1,good
-1,They didn't work
1,"Works great, wether charging 1item, or 4. Haven't tried 5 or 6 at a time yet."
0,"Great leather, however color brown was a not good choice to make.....wife did not like it....."
1,"I was in between many iPhone 6 armbands and I chose this one because it seems like it is more likely to fit my iPhone 6 WITH its case in it. And GREAT news...IT DID! I was so thankful that I didn't have to take my phone out of the case and put it in the armband. My only complaint is that the material is bit flimsy compared to all my previous iPhone 4, 5, iPod Touch, etc. armbands I bought in the past. I'm not sure how long it will last, but hopefully until the next iPhone comes out!"
1,"Easy application for my pebble time. No bubbles, clear coating, great peace of mind now that my screen is protected!"
1,"Great case.  I bought this because most of the other cases out there have an extra layer that the phones attaches to, and then the case attaches to that layer.  This one is different in that the back of the phone fits exactly into the case: there's no extra flap.  These phones are big enough now-a-days, and I have this only as a necessity, not out of choice. (Prefer the old nokias and smaller, slimmer phones of the past.)<br /><br />The tit is EXCELLENT, slim and professional.  There are cutouts-- when opened-- to allow for easy access to the microsd charging flap, the magnetic charging port and the lower sim card flap.  The only reason this case cannot receive 5 stars is because the inner cover lining is some kind of soft fabric: a light-coloured grey.  Because of that it picks up dirt like nobody's business.  I have had around 30 cell phones, and I kid you not: this case is the worst one in terms of showing dirt. It is also &#34;wearing&#34;, as in, getting pilly like a winter sweater would.  This is after owning it for a month. If the inside was a black fabric, or a simple textured plastic like the outer case there'd be no issue, however opening up the phone and seeing a dirty, uncleanable flap is unappealing.  One more thing, the inner spine of the case is also showing wear and picking up light black coloring from the case itself, either that or it is &#34;waering&#34; down and showing the black underside.<br /><br />I don't want to scare you, just giving as much info as possible.  I like crisp and clean, the fit is crisp and clean.  The inside of the case, not so much.  If you are a snacker or have dirty hands in your profession or personal life this may not be the case for you.  If you want a case that fits snugly and professionally this is definitely the case for you."
0,Ok
0,"I dont not think it is OEM, but it works fine just the same."
1,"I travel a LOT by car and start out behind the &#34;Redwood Curtain&#34; in Eureka, California where cell service is spotty at best.  Wherever I go the routes all include many many miles of limited service. Since installing this device I have had strong cell coverage in even the most remote areas with no more than a few miles of occasional loss of service."
1,Nice product
1,"With this mount & Filmic Pro running on my iPhone 6 plus, I now have another great camera added to my gear.  Great mount holds the phone snug.  Would buy again.  Thanks for making it!"
-1,"This case is a good case. Lets get that clear. But, there are some glaring problems that they really need to solve before you buy this.<br />First, the biggest problem. The sides of the case are not tight, and the back came scratched. The scratches hide a little when you put a black custom back on it, but it really could come unscratched."
1,Works great and that's what matters
-1,"Beware! They don't last! Purchased one in 2014. Stopped working afte at few days. Amazon replaced it per their return policy. The second unit lasted a few months past Amazons return date policy. I tried contacting the manufacturer to no avail. Real shame. When the unit worked, it worked very well and sounded great. Probably one of the best sounding earbuds on the market."
1,"my daughter loves it.  It was around three weeks for delivery, but that was the estimated date, so no surprise.  Good product"
0,The &#34;kick stand&#34;  broke after a short period of time.  Otherwise the case has been just fine.
1,Received quickly! Really like the case.
1,This case has already saved my poor phone from what could have been several catastrophes. I am very pleased with this product.
1,This is a really good case .durable and fits in the belt clip great I have put a lot of wear and tear on it and it is doing fine.
1,Great!
0,is slippery to hold on to would have preferred a slightly more tactile feel
1,Excellent
1,Very great. It gives 8% extra boost to charge
1,Good product
1,Perfect. As described and shipping was quick.
0,"They're decent replacements.  I got these for my iPhone 6 Plus and the 6ft one has started to not charge my phone very fast when I connect it to the USB port in my car stereo.  The others seem to be fine so far.  Today I tried using the 6ft one one that was messing up and it only went up about 3% within 30 minutes so I guess I'm done with that one.  On other cables I used to get a message saying about the accessory may not be supported when I would connect it to my car stereo but these don't.  Except once I did but it was with the 6ft one.  Just a faulty cable I suppose.<br />I love the lengths though, especially coming in a 3-pack.  They feel thicker than most cheap iphone cables I've bought though so it seems like you're buying something a little more durable."
-1,Too small!!
1,Great packaging and super easy to apoly to my phone:)
1,"Love this case, works great!"
1,"Worked perfectly. Really blown away by how fast I got it, how easy it was to install and how well it works"
1,"The rubberized case is well textured and grips well. It also has a barely noticeable kickstand if you want to stand it up and use it hands free. Though I only used it once, the removable holster is secure and works well if you use the pressure and friction of your fingertips low on the case to slide it up and out enough to grip the top of the phone ( it's easier to actually do than it is for me to say how ). It's not cheaply made and I recommend it."
1,Really nice comfy headphones. Sink up to my phone easy. Sound quality is actually really good.
1,I have charged several iPhone and this pack never seems to lose a charge.
-1,Broke after a week
1,Holds both wires perfect. Bolts to the battery with no modified
0,"Nice fit. Great on phone , color is really pretty. Haven't dropped my phone so I don't know about the protection. Not every elevated at the ends."
1,"Works great in my 07' Tacoma. The sound quality is as good as I could hope for, w/ loud bass. Finally allows me to plug in my ipod directly w/o using a radio adapter."
1,Very helpful on a very long road trip!  Didn't have to worry about suction cups losing their grip and flying off the dash or window! Use it everyday!
1,This phone case was in great condition. Thanks
1,Excellent. Still works years later
1,All ok
1,Just as pictured! So cute!
1,it protects my nexus 6
-1,The phone is a little too heavy for it and after a time it fall out.
1,Great item....beautiful! Thank you!
1,Works grear
1,Really saved my butt after I sliced the original.
1,very good
-1,"Wrap around piece broke after 3 days, without being dropped or anything. Not worth the money."
1,Very good stuff
1,"Good product, highly recommended"
1,"Pros:  Great speed, great screen and Nokia apps.  Looks good.<br /><br />Cons: Slippery, seriously hard to hold on to.<br /><br />Waiting to see windows 10 later this year."
1,Excellent product. It never gets warm ko matter the gadget you connect. Ihace charged 2 samsung 1 ipad and a extra battery and did it in a good time.
-1,Its already breaking and ive had it for 3 months
1,"Great product, excellent  protection for my new phone."
1,"Yes, this adapter was exactly what I needed to connect my microphone to my Iphone 6 Plus for excellent audio."
1,This item works great I highly recommend.
1,Awesome and easy!
0,"Bought OEM LG phone battery for a great price, but it took way too long (week+) to travel from Van Nuys, CA to Palmdale, CA...a distance less than 50 miles."
1,High quality knock-off.  Why not pay less for more?
1,This was purchased for my teenage son. It fits his I phone 5S very well and is very durable.
1,Love the colors and the fit. Very light but seems durable.
0,Good case but cannot be charged while it's on.
1,"Love this product but for two things.<br /><br />1. I ordered the yellow, and whenever I use flash photography on the rear camera, the image is a bit yellow due to interference from the case.  If the cutout on the back were a bit larger around the flashbulb it wouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />2. The credit card slots are really snug.  The plastic ID slot is so snug I have to really struggle to get my ID in there.  I actually haven't put it completely in there because I don't want it stuck in there."
1,"I purchased this battery a few months back and I fell in love with it. It does what it says it does. It was a little bigger than I expected but I love the build quality of it. Its solid and not too heavy.  I usually just stick in my backpack and leave it there until I need it.  I have a Note 3 so having it is a big plus.  However, the original battery in purchased with break or malfunction, but the customer service department was great and a huge help in was able to provide a replacement really fast. I really recommend this battery and company."
1,Good price for item.
0,"Ok or the price, all plastic and made in China. Would I recommend, sorry no spend a little more and get a good made in the USA product."
1,love it.
-1,Broke already
1,Great amp great transaction
-1,This is not nearly as low profile as the picture seems.  It think it would sit 4 inches above the handle bar.  I ordered a different product and sent this back.
0,very nice for the price
-1,This product is described compatible for Samsung Galaxy S5 however it has micro USB and S5 has 3.0 connection. I tried plugging another cable to the hotcell plug and would not charge. Was unable to use.
0,Its ok... slippery
1,"My niece is 5 and it seems she bends or breaks the smaller end that goes into the IPad Air. This cable seemed stronger then her and so far she's ok with it. I'm glad Anker sees the importance of quality, wether it be cables or chargers!!"
-1,"Good product, but I had to throw mine and my husband's in the trash. I followed all the instrucions on the video exactly as it was told, but the corners and sides do not stick, I tried everything."
1,Best fit of any cover I've ever had. Very solid. Meets all expectations.
1,I love speigen
-1,Really bad. After a week of being used the front casing of the charger came off exposing the wiring. After 3 days the wires were damage. Don't buy this.
1,Great product lasts forever with the charge.  I was amazed to have used it a few times and did not need to charge it until the fifth time I charged my phone.  Very pleased with the product.
1,good cables for the price
1,I love this case and now have it in 2 colors.  It is the perfect size for the Samsung Galaxy S5.  The case provides excellent protection and has held up extremely well after a full year of use.  I have dropped my phone numerous times and it has stood the test of time. I highly recommend this product!
1,works
-1,"Broke immediately over charging port. Got a new one, broke within 3 days."
1,Attractive and very functional. Heavy enough not to be inadvertently knocked over! Well worth the price!
-1,Not any better than the one l already had and they come with no charge what so ever
0,good
1,Why the heck didn't I buy this sooner
1,This case is currently on my phone. It has been dropped many times and there is no cracks or scratches on my phone. I love how the blue part is rubber not plastic so it won't scratch my phone while putting it on unlike other cases. The pink part is hard which I love. I am very satisfied with this iphone case. 100%
1,"AWESOME!!! I bought this case because it does NOT have a stupid magnetic clasp that erases all my credit cards! I am still using the one i bought in 2014, and I use my phone like its my job (well, its my work phone). The only reason I am thinking about purchasing a new one (same case) is because mine is just old and dirty. A+ in my book for holding up until it was old and dirty, not falling apart like other cases i've tried.&#60;3 Peace."
-1,Update: Dropped my phone and the entire case popped right off :(  So cute. Seems protective but still keeps my phone small unlike other protection cases. Seems kind of cheaply made but I still think it's beautiful and fun and will work well
1,Great protection for iPhone. Rhis style of otterbox cover my home bottom on my phone which does not allow dirt behind the screen. Recommend this box to anyone who works out in the elements.
1,"My Samsung Galaxy S3 has a terrible battery life regardless of all of the apps that I close after using.  I try to diligently make sure extra apps are not running and still I get short battery life - nothing near 24 hours.<br /><br />The Mogix was wonderful in allowing me to recharge my phone while on the go during the day, particularly when I was out nearly the entire day on my recent vacation.<br /><br />I am extremely happy with the battery charger."
1,"Excellent phone and delivered on time. Had it about a week now and the battery barely needs a charge. Great phone for my son who lost his last one. Verizon is trying to make you pay $20 a month for 2yrs for this phone or $220 cash, ridiculous... Thank you!!!"
1,Perfect!! Easy to use. Works great and will save $70-100 for an in store applied screen savers. Cool product. Everything you need to do a professional job.
1,Excellent for the lake! And the kids love it! For its price it's a great buy!
1,"Good product ,so far happy"
1,"Best mount I've used for A/C vents. I mount the phone to the vent, then just pull the phone with mount and all right out of the vent when I want to use the phone, and push it back into the vent when I start driving.<br />Other mounts have a hook into the vents, but then you're using two hand to unclip the phone, versus one-handed use with this mount."
1,These are perfect for my 6 port charger to make a ready to go charging station and for my portable pocket charger. Sometimes a regular 3 foot cord is overkill. These are just the right size. The plugs have a solid connection on both ends.
1,I like it and paid way less than an Apple Watch!
1,Very nice cover  for the price
1,"Fit great, AM/FM stations clear, looks BETTER"
1,Charges the iPhone 6 plus perfectly
1,Working great!  Fairly easy to install.  Happy to have my camera back on my phone!
-1,Did not like it.hole for camera is in the middle of the name.cheep looking picture of the name.will not buy anymore covers from that company again.
1,This case is awesome. Has extra pocket for key so you don't have to worry about it getting lost.
1,Great price and product.  It works...charges my iphone and ipad without any issues.
-1,This is a very good one but i recieved a second hand one<br />When u talk is a little hard to understand the person in the phone but to listen music is cmvery nicee and adjusts very good in ur right ear!  I would b happier recieving a brand new one
1,"I recently switched to this case (purchased for about 13% more at a local retailer). I was coming from a much bulkier folio-style case on my iPhone 6 Plus. This thing is fantastic. It is very solid, even though it is also very thin. I have found that Apple Pay works better with this case than my old one because it can get the phone closer to the reader. I also am able to use a wider variety of mounts and holders because of the smaller size.<br /><br />I usually don't use cases on my devices, and the main reason that I choose a case for my iPhone is that the edges are so slippery. I can get a good grip with this case, but unlike a lot of silicone cases, it doesn't pick up dust and pocket-gunk.<br /><br />One thing that isn't mentioned very prominently anywhere here is that the front corners of the case are raised above the screen just a *tiny* bit. Not so much that you'd notice without looking directly at it. However, this has the benefit of raising the glass face of the device off the surface of a table if you like to set your device face-down.<br /><br />One minor complaint is that it is very difficult to get the phone back out, though not impossible.<br /><br />I've been using it for just a few days and regret not buying one sooner."
-1,this is a decent cable however it does not provide much more then .8 amps. For fast and efficient charging you need a cable that can provide up to 2 amps for iPads and at least 1 amp for iPhones. It's hard to tell which ones can achieve this power requirement but there are plenty out there. This will work but it will take a lot longer to change you Ipad and about 20% longer to fully charge you mr iPhone. Other devices using usb will also suffer.
1,"Very Impressed with soundance bluetooth headset. I was able to get these for a discount for an honest review. I couldn't be happier. Pros -Very crisp sound. I like to listen to music and they sound excellent. Does not sound like a tin can like others ive tried. -Compact - i can easily and comfortable put these in my ear with out feeling like an idiot. - Snug - while running and working out never felt like they where going to fall out. -  4 hour battery life on play time. - reliable never felt like it was acting odd or doing what it shouldn't. - Plenty of features with the Play and next track buttons, pretty standard. Never felt clunky - Comes with a functional hard case. Love the case wasn't expecting that doesn't feel cheap.  Cons distance is only 10 meters, not that i can expect more from the compact size the USB port was a little hard to get open at times but not a deal breaker.  Overall this is an excellent product and had a great experience testing it out. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this. Ive tried a few other small headsets this one is the best so far for every day use."
1,as described.
0,"The tempered glass cut out fit my phone perfectly. However, not happy with the bubbles created where the adhesive didn't spread. I read and followed the instructions correctly. Would'nt purschase again."
1,I very much like the stylus for my iPhone but it doesn't work at all on my iPad.  The main reason I made the purchase was for the iPhone so I'm not that displeased with them.  Giving them to friends that I hope they will use and enjoy.  Great value.
0,Doesn't stay firmly inserted and comes unplugged along with the charging cord itself when you remove unless you hold it in.
-1,"Super cute, super cheaply made"
-1,"I had this watch for less than a month and it totally froze.  Garmin support was entirely unhelpful asking me to reset the watch, which I did.  Worked twice, then the same issue.  Garmin sent me a replacement.  The replacement watch had the same flaw. Sent back again, and again the same.  The watch freezes when you leave it on the charger or sometimes it just won't charge at all.  When it works, it's a great watch, though, this isn't a color screen as advertised. The colors are so incredibly hard to see.  The functionality is great, when the watch works.  But for the price, it's not worth it.  Garmin doesn't seem to care that there are a ton of complaints about the freezing screen.  Don't buy this watch until Garmin fixes the buggy software."
-1,Not good falling apart already and cracks .
-1,These don't &#34;latch&#34; into phone or USB so it is easy to dislodge and not charge your device.  I do like the shorter length.
1,This was so inexpensive and is much better than any expensive one we ever used.  I highly recommend this item.
-1,Cheaply made. Basically trash. Ended up throwing it in garbage. Disgusting!
1,"Not much to say, doing its job well (Apple products)."
1,"I really do injoy haviing a charger that works good, glad you carry those kind of chargers."
1,I love it! It's pink & pretty
1,Works like a champ.
1,"The fit is perfect, and so far I have only used one. I would highly suggest this for anyoje looking."
1,"I work in a very noisy environment and I am able to use this speaker with confidence. I can hear the music over it well without noticeable distortion. I also LOVE how long the battery lasts!!! I work 12 hour shifts and I don't have to worry that this speaker isn't going to run out of juice while in use, an issue I have had in the past with other such devices. This speaker consistently outlasts my phone."
-1,"I am not a dumb person by any means, and I am very good at meticulous jobs. Still, I could not get these to look decent and apply well, and I followed the directions to a T.<br />Waste of money."
1,The friend I purchased this for LOVES IT!
1,this is the best portable charger fir iPad it charged 3 full charges and my phone about 5 full charges before it needed to be charged its self grate for long over seas travel
1,"For those of you who are into coloring pages, this looks like a coloring page for the back of your phone."
0,Good
1,Great product and very nicely done.
1,I love this screen protector.  I was afraid I'd drop my new phone and break the screen but now I don't have to worry about it.  The screen arrived in a few days.  It went on very easily and not a single bubble!  It seems like all the other screen protectors I've purchased for my various phones and tablets had at least one bubble somewhere  but not this one!  I love it!
1,"I love the case, however, it was supposed to be blue but what I received was a bright pink!"
1,for a penny i love this case
1,"Good product, would recommend!"
1,great
1,"This phone is another Samsung slam dunk. However, it never got LTE for T-Mobile in the US. I don't know if all unlocked phones are going to have this problem. I really liked this phone and all of the features. If you're ok with not being able to get 4G than this will work for you.  Great phone and it's very unique. Would definitely buy again if I knew that I could get the speed that 4G LTE has."
1,"Very nice, durable material.  No complaints"
1,I will recommend my friend!This is a great gift!
1,it is cute and durable and I have gotten a lot of positive comments on it<br />my only concern is sometimes the flap gets in the way when I am trying to make a call.
-1,"Won't charge my phone. Had to get a 2.4amp USB auto charger. Should have paid more attention when purchasing, I believe this is just a 1.2amp USB."
1,Did what it claimed to do.  Easy to work. I used on a Samsung charge
1,Doesn't match my phones color 100% but fits great
1,Wife loves this earpiece and it was easy to pair with her iphone
0,the picture was different from the stylus pens i got. But the stylus pens i got still worked ok
-1,"Junk, the back door holding the cards breaks after 3 months of use.  I have one that broke and I purchased one for my wife that also broke.  Stay away until they make the door hinges stronger."
1,great stuff
-1,worked great for about 6mos - now says its not a certified apple product
1,Aweosme HD quality car cam a must buy and it has a very good wide angle. I have tried many dash cams and this one seems to hold out with the insane desert heat here in Vegas.
1,Works well just need to get use to
1,Excellent
1,Great phone
-1,Bag tore along the seam after first use.
1,Great and useful gadget.  I don't leave home without it and I never forget my iPhone at home anymore
1,Love it and keeping it.
1,"Good looking case, especially for the price.  The only thing I didn't like was the screen protector.  My Touch ID wasn't working with the profits teen protector.  I removed it and kept the shatter proof protector that I already had on my phone."
1,Its beautiful!!!!!<br />I love it...
1,On average products.
1,I put one of these on my new Fenix 3 watch three months ago and it still looks perfect.  Not a scratch on it and it fits PERFECTLY on the screen.
1,LG protective case works as advertised.
-1,"Its a very cheap product. Don't waste your money buying it. When i plugged this in to my car charging port, it blowed the charging port fuse. I went to a mechanic and fixed the fuse. Again plugged in this one, it did same thing after.  I wont recommend this."
1,Yes the camera is good quality and work perfect. Now problem with installation fet perfectly as the factory on.l recommend it for everyone looking for galaxy s4 replacement.
1,"I've ordered several of these over the past years, and they all worked great."
0,Very tight. Worked great
1,Great Stylus Easily attaches to my IPAD.
0,It's a not to rave about case. Does its job.
1,Great replacement!
-1,My phone keeps coming out of the case...iPhone 5c
1,Worked ask advertised
1,I have used these on my phones for approximately 4 years and I recommend them for protecting your phone screens. They do not affect the touch control.
1,Great system. Easy to install.
1,FANTISTIC THAT WE COULD FIND THIS ITEM REPRESENTING BAYLOR UNIVERSITY.
1,I purchased this cover for my first smart phone. After the sticker shock I decided to find a cheap but good quality case. I am very pleased with this case. It does the job and added bonus of being stylish. I had no problems putting this on the phone.
1,OK phone for the price
1,Nice
1,Excellent product as described!
1,Great product.  Handsome looking pens and handy for tablets.
1,"I can complete my phone's battery at least twice, and still left to charge more. Excellent."
-1,Be aware that if you do not use the device for 60 days your data expires... what i thought it never expired.... not true you have to use the device and your data otherwise it expires.... generally slow connection and had to make regular calls to customer service to keep it working. i am currently test driving Karma to see if it is a  real alternative.
1,"This works great for hiking, running etc...great price, and delivery timing"
-1,"I received this case yesterday. I was pretty excited to put it on my phone since its a very beautiful case. Problem is there os absolutely no grip to this case at all. I brought this because of the rubber gripping on the back. Dropping your phone is a major problem with this case. This is horrible, im giving it two stars for the look."
-1,Slippery case horrible
1,Love them
1,i had issues with the headset but global box made it right with me. nice to have a company care about my experience with a product.
1,"Received my mini selfie stick today. It was very well packaged and also came with a little velvet bag to store it in. I have a large LG Stylo and its kind of a tight squeeze to get it in the clasp but it will hold it. The stick stretches about 2 ft. Just enough to get a few more friends into that selfie!! Or like me, getting a selfie with a concert going on behind you! Great shots thanks to this little guy! I did recieve this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion. Overall its a great little selfie stick easy to carry in your pocket. Im definitely enjoying it!"
1,It seems to be good.
1,"Works great, great value for the money."
-1,I used this cable for about six weeks and than it just stopped workin. I have tried it on different device multiple time since than but no result.  It was very difficult for me to believe that $15 iPhone cable will just stop charging so soon.  by the way I take a good care of my electronics and the cable had no visual damages so it may have been defective or just my luck.
-1,This was billed as an unlocked tablet and its not. Its a T-Mobile tablet.
1,"I ordered this product because I needed a long cord and it did not disappoint! It's long enough to go from my surge protector to my bed and I can sleep on either side and not be limited by the cord. I highly recommend it for people who sleep with their phones, but still want it to get a charge."
1,"These days with phones being so expensive, more than laptops even, you need to protect it with high quality cases. This one hits it right on the nail head. The material feels amazing, no sharp edges anywhere and yet feels durable. The face cover is something new for me and so far it works like it's not on the phone face. A great added feature to know that your screen is protected by another screen. Headphone plug, charger plugs are protected really nice to prevent debris from going in. I love that feature. I'm also still able to charge my phone on the remote pad charger without having to plug it in.<br /><br />The section that goes on your belt is also solid. The clips doesn't separate from the receiving section, so it will be a bit bulky. I work on construction sites so this is the perfect case for my phone investment."
1,great product
1,"great  case, cute an safe. good price"
-1,"Never worked with any device, maybe I just got a dud"
1,Great product so far
1,"The materials and construction quality are excellent. I am not sure exactly how many times I can completely charge my modern/large screen cell phone with the Jackery at full capacity, but I can confidently say at least three times. I own one (so far) of this particular model and the wife owns two. The price is extremely reasonable and simply fantastic as a Lightning Deal. Highly recommend."
-1,"Sound quality microphone qaulity comfort and battery are all 4 star! I use this with my iPhone 6, the Bluetooth button won't pick up a call or end a call and with blue tooth connected my phone delays picking up the call. Maybe better with a different phone not happy with it on my iphone"
1,Case is pretty awesome! The kickstand is great for watching Netflix and Youtube. Case feels good in the hand and protects the phone well. Right after I put it on I went dog walking (I'm a pet sitter) and the dog pulled while I was changing songs on my phone. It dropped on the concrete but was completely fine. Not even a scratch on the case. Will recommend to friends.
1,"Fixing an iPhone is a nightmare.  This really didn't help at all, but it did give me exactly what I needed to fix it and for a fair price."
1,"I changed to Garmin FR 225, after my Polar M400 failed to charge after 3 months working. I am very happy with this change. Following is my comparison to Polar M400:<br /><br />- Heart rate monitor: I had problem to use a heart rate trap, since it hurts my skin every time. I was skeptical to the build-in heart rate monitor of Garmin 225 at the beginning. After several times of using, I am very happy with it. It indeed gives accurate heart rate measure. Of course one should carry the watch as it is required. Otherwise it can have large error.<br /><br />- Charge: Someone complains the charge connection of Garmin 225 for not using USB. But if I compare it with Polar M400, which connects the watch with a micro-USB, I would say the Garmin 225 connection is much superior. The montage of the connector is very convenient, I don't need to use one of my finger to hold the rubber-cover of the USB, while the other fingers are holding the watch, as I did for Polar M400. The Garmin 225 charge is much more robust, reliable and convenient.<br /><br />- GPS signal: To find the GPS is faster with Garmin 225 than Polar M400. It takes usually a few secs, without need to keep the hand still, as Polar M400 always requires.<br /><br />- Elevation measurement: Gamin 225 measures elevation more accurate than Polar M400. Polar M400 has a granularity of 5m. If I run the same way back, I get for instance an ascending 55m and descending 65m. Garmin 225 is accurate to 1m, and I get the same ascending and descending for the same road back.<br /><br />- Cadence: Cadence is a very useful information which Polar M400 misses. One can improve the running technique based on it. Yet Polar M400 provides the running index which I don't see with Garmin 225. Although it can be used to predict the race pace somehow, it is just like a magic number and gives no hints for the running technique.<br /><br />- Environment information: it is very useful that Garmin 225 gives information like the temperature and wind speed/direction. The only thing I am missing with Garmin Connect is that I am not able to expand the map to the full browser.<br /><br />Yet Garmin 225 is not perfect. I find a serious error in the number of best pace. For instance, I run a slow running with average pace 7:40min/km. From the chart I can see my peak pace at 5min/km. I can't image how it is possible that Garmin 225 shows my max. pace with 2:44min/km. For this I would reduce the rate of the watch by half point. Hope this is just a software error and can be corrected in future versions.d speed/direction.

-1,Returned it.
1,Holds iPhone 6 securely. Works great.
1,It has nothing to envy of any mid-range phone . In my opinion many opt for this because of its excellent specifications and price.-
-1,I got it two weeks ago and the clip already broke. I guess that what I deserve for being cheap and buying cheap crap. You get what you pay for.
1,"Absolutely great case! Durable material, easy to put on and take off and the side buttons on the phone are just as responsive with the case on as they are with it off. Great purchase!"
1,It was alright
1,"Purchased for a business phone, liked the case so much that I purchased another for my personal phone."
1,"Great smartphone, working in Venezuela 3G Digitel Movistar and Movilnet"
1,"Great case. Fits perfectly and doesn't mess up the buttons. It is also easy to get to all of the ports. The seller also included a stylus, water proof bag/case, a screen protector, and a screen cleaning pad. The case seems like it will protect the phone from normal drops and accidents."
1,So far so good!  One month in and it looks and feels good!
1,works great. Bought it to power my phone when used as a GPS. It provides more than enough power.
1,So cute!!! Could not believe how quick I received it!!
1,very fast shipping..excellent quality
-1,My husband puts these on phones for a living he places this one against my phone Gently  and it shatters.. Poor quality for as much as you pay for it. NOT WOTH IT.
1,I've only dropped it once so far and it did a great job of protecting the phone.<br />Part of the reason why I have not dropped it more often is because the case has fantastic grip!
1,"These screen protectors are really good for protecting my two Moto G phones that I've bought three weeks ago and are still doing a good job as I speak.When I first tried to apply them to my two phones they not that hard to get on the screens after I thoroughly read the instructions that they came with placing the screen protectors on were pretty straight forward.The pack of these amFilm Moto G screen protectors for the 1st Gen Moto G phone came with three screen protectors,three rubber bands,a dust remover stickers for cleaning off the dust on the adhesive side of the screen protectors and a card for getting the air bubbles out.Speaking of air bubbles that part of the installation to these amFilm screen protectors didn't stick all the way through to the point where I could not see any more bubbles on the screen to my Moto G phones.I mean I did use the card to remove the air bubbles as much as I can but I still noticed a little but it wasn't all bad even though the cut out line isn't entirely fitting the Moto Gs but that ok I thought I would just go along with getting these screen protectors any way since I was in need of good ones like the kind that has special features to them like HD or Anti-glare being added to the phone's screen which would enhance them for a better look and feel and that is why I bought these to give a extra HD look to my two Moto G phones and I really like them for that.Later if I happen to come across anything better than these screen protectors then I'll most likely get those after I do some research on them."
-1,The case was bigger than the phone .. It did not fit at all. Money wasted .
-1,Does not have the cut out to remove the s pen which is displayed in the picture and description
-1,Very disappointed.  Much too small for the Galaxy Note 4 screen. Previous screen cover fit much better.
1,Love it
1,Goooood
1,Installed these in the front doors of my 2000 Subaru Forester to replace the ones that were distorting. Had to modify the plastic mount but once installed they sounded quite good. I wouldn't say they were fantastic but for the price they were a great replacement for the old factory ones.
1,"Great value for email, web, Facebook, Uber, etc.  First time with Android - easy.  Paired with H2O on arrival in U.S. from Asia.  Working in about 15 minutes following charge.  Prefer the slightly smaller screen / overall size."
1,batteries don't last as long as I'd hoped.
1,Work great and up to 15 feet away from phone.
1,I have a thin case on my phone and this is a hit and miss when trying to charge it.
-1,"Flimsy, useless."
-1,This product is incompatible with the stock 2007 VW Jetta.
1,Arrived on time and perfect for my needs! Gr8 price!
1,O.K.
-1,dont waist your money ! does not work 😂
1,my daughter likes it.  good product.  arrived within a week.
1,The case is slippery - about as slippery as the iPhone 6 itself.
-1,Bought two of these. They do not extend wide enough for iPhone6+ or Nexus6 except you try to pull hard enoygh to break it. Also one of mine came used as well. At least the rubber cushion for the phone edge looked depressed and previously used. Returning these today.
0,Good product
1,Haven't used yet. Looks like good quality.
-1,"Batteries are junk, shorted my phone out"
1,"Great case, heavy duty. I like it. I will recommend it to others."
1,Very good quality case. I love it!
1,"Love it. Works exactly how I wanted it too, and I don't have to reach into my flip belt or side to change any settings if need be"
1,Excellent
1,The iPhone 6 Plus (5.5&#34;) Tribe armband is fantastic. It fits with the case I have on my phone and stays up on my arm while I run. These are strong features and very convenient! I would recommend it to a friend. I have had arm bands for other phones in the past that slipped and couldn't fit a phone case well. The shipping was rapid and I was off and running immediately!
1,Great product!!
0,"Comfortable to wear. Very descent audio. Range is poor but, sufuce for working out. Mic not so great but, usable."
1,"[[VIDEOID:14bcffebd6a45821a64d9f5b8a682de3]] This EMIE Memo External Battery 8000mAh with Wake on Shake is a pretty neat little battery. Its very slim  and comes in a few cool colors. Its packaged well too. It is an 8000mAh battery so it should charge your smart phone roughly a couple of times before needing juice back in it. Most phones have a 2000 to 2500 mAh battery.  It does have smart charging so it wont over charge your device. Your device tells it what it needs and this guy sends that to the device. You can plug it in and forget it..it will do its thing and do it safely.<br /><br />You do give it a shake to get the battery indicator to come on. Neat..but not necessary. It does have an LED light on it that lights up when its charging or being used. Here is my indifference..There 3 indicator lights on here to show you how much juice is left in this battery. The book says green is 0 to 30% ,blue is 30 to 70%, and red is 70 to 100%<br /><br />Here is my problem with that. Green is LOW? Red Is good? And 30 to 70% ....thats a huge jump to me ...30% means I need to charge this..70% means I'm still good. So what is it..good or no? So those 2 things really didnt impress me.<br /><br />Hey guys it does what it is advertised to do..it looks cool, its slim and it's got that shake to wake thing going on. The battery indicator thing really bugs me though. I am giving this EMIE Memo External Battery 8000mAh with Wake on Shake 4 stars for those reasons.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br />I received a sample product to test and evaluate. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review."
1,Really happy with product. Has substantial weight to it.
1,Great product and at just about the right price.
1,"So far works great. In fact,  I ordered one, liked it so much, that I ordered three more. However when the three others came in they were similar products but had slightly different markings as well as connection. Not sure that it matters in the product performance, but unexpected."
-1,Did not fit
1,This pen works very well for my Galaxy Note products.  The electronic eraser works great.  LOVE IT!
-1,Get what you pay for
1,"Works good, the ends are way too bright and the cord lights you can barely see. For the price, love it but had to put a small piece of black tape over the end smiley faces because it was so bright."
1,I love it 😍😍
1,"The size of the phone is the main reason i made this purchase, and I def think it was the right decision. I love the functionality of this and its compact size. The camera is AMAZING, it is better than any other android phone i have own in the past."
1,I love it! The sound is great and the battery lasts a while
1,Cute case
1,"Great product, love it"
1,Easy to apply; no bubbles. I did feel that it was a little more reflective (slight glare) than other tempered glass products I have used.
1,"This is not an otterbox. This is otterbox lite at best. The belt clip is useless, you have to put it is screen down. Which means when you need to use the phone you have to take it out of the clip entirely, and it is a very tight fit. too tight. the case very much so does interfere with my screen protector. why did I get a stylus? Its a galaxy note. On the plus side the kickstand is kickass and it is considerably thin. would give 5 stars if the belt clip worked better."
-1,The screen did not stick to the entire phone causing unremovable air bubbles in the top corners and because the top did not stick all the way it got caught on my pocket and bent the entire top down.
1,Quick Charge 2.0 Wall Charger really changes my phones and ipad very quickly.  I am not sure how I ever lived without it.  I use it non stop with work.  I received this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion which I am giving.  I love how simple this is to plug in and start charging your phone.  Because I often work on my phone day in and day out I have to keep it always charged.
-1,I should have paid more attention to the 1 star reviewers because they were exactly right. The sound from the earphone has so much feedback that is immediately annoying and unbearable to utilize. Outgoing conversations are fair at best even with the extended boom microphone. The supplied earbuds don't seem to stay in my ear either no matter what size I use. The ear hook design has a tendency to pull the headset away from my ear canal thus defeating the noise cancelling feature. It is a no-brainer to return this asap. Trust me on this or you will regret your purchase.
1,Lots of room for your complete GPS. Highly recommend it.
1,"All good so far, got them for out door activities, fit is good , simple instructions"
1,I use this for my 2015 wrx and if fits perfectly.
1,Get phone case...Fits perfectly & protects the phone. Also arrived on time. Thank you
1,This was the first SPECK product that I bought.  Best phone cover ever.  Phone is protected from all sides.  I have dropped my phone a number of times in the garage and phone bounces.
0,"I ended up not using this, because Samsung replaced my phone for a issue I was having, and it obviously had a new clip on the phone. But I am going to keep for future use. Looks like it will fit with no problems, packaging has everything that it said it would."
-1,"These worked really good, until they didn't. Recently, these have been shorting, and causing my phone to become really hot, and stop charging on times. This is really annoying, and I stopped using these because I was worried it could damage my phone."
-1,"I like the weight and the length, but it sometimes takes several taps for my tablet to react.  My older fat tip m-edge stylus had no issues.<br />I'll keep these because I like the smaller tip, but I'm disappointed with the function."
-1,"These worked great the first time I used them -- easy to connect, clear sound, and exactly what I wanted. The second time I used them the sound started skipping. I thought this would be fixed by recharging them, but it hasn't fixed them. I can't use them because the sound skips every few seconds. Very disappointing."
1,Excelent
0,"Cute case, especially for the price. I used it for about a month and then I noticed the air bubble get bigger. I was worried it would leak onto my phone so I took it off. I may use it again, but since it really doesn't provide any protection I'll use it for looks."
1,Really good quality for the price.
1,"A really nice portable power charger from foxx electronics. I love the size of it, it can fix nicely on my purse or my pocked. A little bit bigger than a regular lipstick sized. Not heavy at all. I have others and are very heavy. It is silver and nice looking.  I love that it brings a build in flashlight. That is a really nice extra. It charges my iPhone 6 plus good. Perfect for emergency I always carry it around specially when I go out shopping or to the park with the kids.  One thing that I didn't like it that it gets really hot. So either mine is defective or they are all like that. But it only happens some times. Either way it charges great. Very useful and easy to carry and use. Works with many electronics .  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion."
1,"I would give them 5 *, but one of the new batteries doesn't hold a charge like the other. I really think my problem is with my phone. I will find out  tomorrow after I get it back to factory reset, to make sure it's the phone not the battery. The wall charger is the best idea, so you don't have to wear out the mini micro USB charging plug. A1 + in my book no wear and tear on the phone for you to worry about if you ask a little one to plug it in or unplug it "
1,Good for inexpensive product. Rubber like material on sides bends easily and gets stuck in pockets.
1,Met my needs. I don't have to carry a wallet anymore.
1,"Works with 2008 Chrysler Sebring.  Instructions were adequate, 2 harness options provided."
1,My son just got the S6 and he is required to have a durable case on it at all times. I use this case for my S5 so it was an east decision to buy. No complaints. Thought the S6 is about the same size w/o case as my S5 with cases on the newer Defender seems a bit smaller and lighter. We weighed the bare phones and they are nearly identical in both size and weight. I have to conclude the OB found a way to make the cases less intrusive in size/weight while offering the same protection and quality of materials. :)
1,Great price on these cables; seems we always need one.
1,&#34; Installed easily. Prompt delivery and the instructions were clear and concise. &#34;
1,worked as described.
1,"Fast delivery, works like original!"
1,Works well.
1,I am looking forward to purchasing more ideas for amazon. I love my Galaxy s6 edge case
1,Works great!!
1,We love this bluetooth speaker! We use it everywhere and the sound quality is crisp and clean. We listen to an eclectic mix and all the genres we tried sound great (but I don't know about rap/hip hop as the bass doesn't seem adjustable)
1,"Amazing product, completely water resistant. Took it on a family vacation and got it wet and my phone was intact, dry. Got lots of people asking me where I got it from. Would recomend to everyone!"
-1,Not well made. None of the joints will stay in position consequently the you have to constantly reposition the device to see the screen. After two days it went into the trash.<br />This is inexpensive but simply doesn't work. Save yourself a lot of hassles and pass on this one
-1,For some reason  this samsung cable doesn't  work is the 3rd one i am order same problem
1,"Part of the apple watch experience is wearing it everywhere, all day.  Especially during active times, where often there is a greater chance of smacking it on something.  This product is custom fit to protect it very well.  the face is not the first thing to touch due to the raised edges, although you might want to add a screen protector as well.  The only reason it's docked a star is that I had hoped I'd be able to slip it on and off fairly easily to use it just at times I need that extra protection. However, it's functionality of fitting firmly around the body does mean some effort getting it seated properly around the buttons and parts. It was quite tight, and I found heating it in hot water helped make it more pliable to get into place.  So I won't be swapping it back and forth as much as planned.  I'm very happy to have it on hand for sports where a knock or scratch could be an option though."
1,clear pic quality but you can't see the screen if you turn it to the angle to see the road (unless you mount it on the left side of the window).  you have to remove the memory storage because it won't loop the video
1,Excelente producto !!!!
1,Received timely - fit phone
-1,Not for Galaxy S5! The closest fitting case (for S4?) is slightly too small which keeps the lens permanently out of focus.
1,Great
1,Good product. Strong magnet. Just a little worried if it would mess up anything in the phone.
1,"I drop my phone a lot and this keeps it looking like new, second case from Spigen, truly a quality brand and a good look for your phone. Excellent."
0,Loved the case only thing was that it's already falling apart on the bottom and I just received it today  it's like the glue didn't hold right 😔 but other than that it's so pretty and sparkly 😍
1,Love it
0,I ordered this one and the Anduro holster shell stand. This one is very secure and works good. The Anduro won hands down. No way could you lose this phone from you belt.
1,Just as good as Zagg for a fraction of the price
1,Very nicely made hard case cover.  Makes the phone look more attractive and sleek.
1,"Excellent invention, I do actually LIKE and use this religiously in the car"
1,The product works extremely well. They were very inexpensive but took a long time to deliver. I would have paid more to deliver faster.
1,Bought this for my wife and she loves it! The glitter doesn't come off like other cases and it holds up very nicely.
1,really increased my picture taking.  love it
1,Excellent A+++++ Product....I am very happy
1,Works great
1,This is a great product. Easy to use and I love that it repels water.
1,This is an excellent case for my galaxy 2. Keeps it safe and looks very stylish.
1,The whole system works great on my motorcycle for gps and stuff. I am on my second one because the rubber cracked and dried out on my first one.
1,"The speaker sounded great and had awsome volume for such a small speaker, but it started making a high pitched whining noise after I tested it at full volume."
1,Great battery and the cover feels very nice in my hand.
1,Nicely made.
1,Very durable and easy to put on! The best part is no bubbles!! I also love that my fingers don't leave smudges on my screen anymore!! Very worth it! And hey you can't beat this low price! I highly recommend this!
-1,The case is too bulky and is made from two pieces. The quality of the materials seems ok but I dont like it's bulk.
1,My husband liked it it helped his phone  a lot
1,Good looking and easy to install.
1,Charges my Note 4 2.5 times and can jump start a 4 cylinder car instantly.  Great job!
-1,No real difference for me between the desktop model and this one. Didn't broadcast the signal out of my room.
-1,Does not work
-1,it does not work with iphone...
-1,Had it 2 months and it completely separated at the plug.
0,It was a beautiful case arriving right on time. Unfortunately it broke shortly after.
-1,"It's been one year, and it's broken. It no longer holds a charge."
1,Perfect for charging your iPhone when you're out and about!
1,Very loud.  Will shake the whole car and than some
1,A stylish roomy case for all of your small camera needs.
1,Good quality and the picture is not rubbing off.
-1,The colors are way different than view online. I didn't even know there's two colors on it. Wish it has free return.
1,Really like it
0,It works very well - much better than one I had tried previously. I would give it a five if the metal bars that are exposed when you put your phone in it weren't rusty when we received it.
0,The volume  is not that great on music and on the phone the other person on the other side cant hear me i have to hold the microphone close to my mouth
1,This is a very cute and practical phone case. It seems to be well made and fits perfectly. It was very easy to put on and the colors I just like the ones in the picture. I gave it four stars because the screen was very difficult to put on yet even though I'm not very carefully and there was no dice on the phone when I put it on it still had bubbles that I could not get out of it.  Overall though a very well-made product.<br /><br />I did receive this product for free or at a discount for an honest and unbiased review and that is what I have given you today.
1,Very good product the charging is perfect. Anker is my favorite brand of electronic products all the way.
1,So LOVE this case! The price was GREAT along with the quality! Highly recommend it to all Stanley Cup Champions Blackhawks fans!!!
1,Good price
1,I'm pleased with my purchase.
1,"These are awesome headphones!  This is the first time I've ever used wireless/bluetooth headphones and I love them!  They are so convenient!!<br /><br />***FUNCTIONS***<br />- Pair with multiple devices<br />- Cancel, answer, reject, and end calls<br />- Redial the last number<br />- Call transfer (headset to phone) & Call transfer (phone to headset)<br />- Microphone mute & Cancel mute<br />- Volume +/-<br />- Skip to next or go back to previous songs<br />- Play/pause<br /><br />***PROS***<br />- My iPhone and Macbook found the headphones very easily and paired with them in seconds.<br />- They charged in about 10-15 min.  The instructions say that they take 1.5 hours to fully charge, but the first time I plugged them in to charge them right out of the box they were charged in about 10 minutes when I plugged them into my laptop which itself was not plugged into it's power source and these still were able to charge quickly.  Though the light turns blue when they are fully charged, whereas the instructions say the red light goes off - technically yes the red light goes off but there is a blue light that indicates when they are fully charged.<br />- There is a computerized female voice that says &#34;Power On&#34;, &#34;Power Off&#34;, &#34;Low Battery&#34; etc.  That's all I've heard her say so far, but I'm not sure what else is in her vocabulary.<br />- They will power off automatically if they aren't being used for about 10 min.  I was watching a movie computer with them and I paused my movie and walked away to do some things but kept the headphones in my ears and after about 10 minutes the voice said &#34;Power off&#34;.  But I just clicked the power button when I got back to my computer and it played no problem (I didn't have to pair them again).<br />- Great for working out because you never have to worry about the cord and if you're using your phone you can have it across the room, you don't have to carry it or keep it on you the whole time.<br /><br />***CONS***<br />- The volume buttons are conveniently on one of the ear pieces but the up and down ends of the volume buttons aren't as prominent to the touch (aren't as elevated for you to feel with your fingertip) as I would expect. Perhaps I'm just still getting used to them, but I occasionally have turned up the volume when I wanted to turn down because I can't feel the + and - very well, but remembering the + is at the top helps.<br />- Because these are wireless and have lots of features/capabilities like answering the phone and they have to pair with your devices etc. It is worth reading the instructions (which I normally wouldn't do with just a pair of headphones), but these have lots of capabilities so it is worth it to read the instructions so you can remember which buttons to press and how long to press them for to have the headphones do all the functions you want them to do.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these headphones, I am very pleased with them.<br /><br />_________________<br />Made by: TOSHENG<br />ASIN: B012QTR0AA<br />Product provided for review by: TOSHENG<br />Shipped by: Amazon LLCof the volume buttons aren't as prominent to the touch (aren't as elevated for you to feel with your fingertip) as I would expect.

1,"Great product, works well, fits secure - dad was happy"
1,pi got this item at a deep discount to try and review and give my honest opinion it was shipped fast and works for my needs
1,Product deliverey was excellent and case is a excellent fit. Its been 1 days but no complaints. Thanks for great service!😄
-1,LOVE THE PRODUCT
1,Have had this for roughly a month and still working great. Which is more than I can say for some others I have bought.
1,"I dropped my phone and this broke after a few times. But it is cheap and if you don't drop your phone as often as I do, then it will probably hold up fine. Love the design."
1,I always carry it with me wherever I go :D
1,Bought this months ago and it works better than when I bought my phone originally
1,"I really like these. They fit flush into the lighter plug and allow me to keep the compartment/ashtray door closed all the time. When I want to use it, I pull the cable out of the glove box and plug it in. For me it easily charges two iPhones at the same time while driving on a trip. No more fighting over the plug and it disappears when not in use - win/win!"
-1,Ugly color of dingy brown and offers little protection.  Would return it if it weren't such a hassle to do so.
1,"Have used this product for about two months now as my daily charger at work. Quality has been good, no experiences of not charging or being warned by iOS that the device is unsupported. Would (and probably will) buy this product again."
-1,Waste of money. My 12 daughter thought she was buying an actual case. I wish I could figure out how to return it.
1,Good
1,"This device is designed for the high-speed charging of a Galaxy S6.  I cannot speak to this claim.  However, it states that it is adaptive to work with other devices at their rated charging capacity.  This appears to be essentially true in all my tests.<br /><br />My primary phone is a Galaxy S5. The original charger essentially charges at the rate at just under 1 minute per percent of battery life when charging from approximately 50% charge. I have used other chargers that the phone identifies as &#34;slow&#34; and asks me to use the original charger.  This charger is NOT identified as slow and chargers the phone at just about 1% per minute from the same point of  discharge.  It is slightly slower than the original Samsung charger but pretty darn close.<br /><br />I also tried it on my Kindle Fire HD.  My Kindle Fire generally took overnight to charge with the &#34;normal&#34; chargers (generally less than 1 AMP).  So I purchased two &#34;high-speed&#34; chargers to deal with this and as backup chargers for my S5's charger..  The two other chargers are the Amazon 2.0 watt charger and an Orico usb fast charge with two usb ports - a high-speed and a &#34;universal&#34;.  Here are some quantitative test times using my Kindle Fire HD.<br />Amazon 2.0 Watt charger: about 13% in 30 minutes<br />Orico high-speed charger via the fast port: about 13%  in 30 minutes<br />Stalion charger: about 13 % in 30 minutes<br />Stalion charger with longer Kindle Fire HD cable: 13 % in 30 minutes<br /><br />I also tried this charger on my very old droid bionic.  The bionic charged from 15% to 30% of its battery in 30 minutes. That seems comparable to or better than I remember it charging when it was my primary phone. this speaks to the adaptability of this charger.<br /><br />Lastly, I tested it to charge several Apple devices.  Again, no extra speed but no charging issues.<br /><br />Overall, I find this to be a decent and capable charger.  The most significant shortfall is the very short usb charging cable -- Just 20&#34;!  Although this is annoying, If you have the original charging cables for your devices or other quality usb cables, there is no reason to not use them.  I did find that with my other high speed chargers (2.0 Amp), you can definitely have poor performance with some older usb cables.  If you are havingcharging issues, do not rule out the cable as the source of the problem.<br /><br />The last two points I want to make.<br />1) I did receive a free produce in return for this review.<br /><br />2) I have purchased other products from Stalion and I have easily and successfully utilized their warranty service.  This produce comes with a 2 year warranty and I think that is great since I know that they stand behind their products.<br /><br />I took one star off for the short cord. Otherwise, this appears to be a solid product with a great warranty.  At the list price, I think it is significantly overprices.  However, I have see in on Amazon in the $14 price range which is comparable to or cheaper than other  high speed chargers."
1,"Works great,  I like how it shuts off when your phone is full unlike other charges that make your phone beep over and over again telling you the battery is full and to disconnect the charger.  It also charges super fast on my Galaxy S6 Edge Plus"
1,works and seems of a decent quality.  time will tell.
1,"This is a great product. For me, the comfort of the design and material is what I was looking for in an armband. I don't want to be thinking about my armband when I'm struggling through a run. I just don't think you could get an armband more comfortable than this one. I forget that it's there."
-1,Does not work
1,I love it well worth  the money absolutely  water proof and it's not bulky it's stylish and looks great on the phone and the sensitivity on the keyboard is excellent  well worth It I have the blue one and loved it no problems.
-1,Doesn't work. Won't play the music out loud (aux cord). Save your money
1,Wish it was waterproof
1,Very neat ~ I love it and get compliments on it frequently.
1,The ring is very good and the quality is OK  I like it a lot
1,"Prompt shipping, came sooner than expected.  This is my second one - the first one busted when my phone dropped, but my phone is unscathed.  Fits my iPhone perfectly."
1,Shipment and product was as presented.  I received 2 days before expected date.
-1,the screen came securely shipped. but after installing .. it was a bit loose on the edges.  which you anhide with a cover.  not a perfect 10
1,not a scratch was made and sometimes it feels cool as in cold not &#34;cool&#34; which gives me a really good feeling about the phone. Due to my rugged usage it has got a few scratches and after 4 months I took it off (Worst decision ever). Would gladly buy it again. Actually I will buy again.
1,Feels great. Excellent response. Super easy to install. Would buy again.
1,"This case is awesome! Holds the phone, 2-4 credit cards/id's and plenty of room for cash. I get compliments on it all the time. Loved it so much I bought one for my mom. Had an issue and customer service had it corrected in 24 hours. Really impressed!"
1,Love it!
1,I used this all over Asia and the key for me was peace of mind. I don't want to investigate or count on the item I'm using switching voltage. This made it all worry free. It comes in a small box and has a slight hum which I could only hear when I stood near it. It's very well made and definitely worth the price.
1,Works great
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
-1,This is not a good product. It will stretch and then if you try to reposition it and you get the tiniest bit of dirt it will not stick.
1,"The particular cable is just about the same price, had I bought those at TJ Maxx or Ross, and theirs are of more thicker cables than the ones I ordered from yourselves, just as thick as the original Apple cable that comes in the box."
0,The case looks way better in the picture than in reality. The quality is okay but not what I expected. It can be protective but it isn't the best. There are better cases out there and I expected more from this one. It came with a regular screen protector and a stylus as described.<br />The care is a hard but flexible plastic which is not a thick as you would expect in the picture as one of those cases that come with the thick shockproof plastic and the hard piece to cover it. This is not that at all. I haven't dropped my phone yet to test the durability of it. When resting the phone flat on its face there is a small gap so the screen has some sort of &#34;protection&#34;.<br />The screen protector is alright. I don't see it lasting very long as it has gotten some scratches easily.<br />And with the stylus... well... I didn't order it for the stylus. It does its job but you really cant go so wrong with the build quality of a stylus.<br />In my opinion its alright. I do not recommend it although it came on time but for 8bucks you can't complain but can still find something better.<br />Keep looking as I will and happy hunting.
0,One of them overheated to the point it burnt my finger
-1,"I bought these to use while I cut my 5 acres of grass in Florida. They did not stay in my ear when I was sweaty and after trying them a couple of times, the right side no longer had sound. Very frustrated!!!"
1,Great!
1,It's great! Better then what I thought it would be. Just wish it came with a screen protector.
1,Perfect
1,Great case and very attractive.  Very hard to put on and remove.  Part of the plastic broke trying to take the case off to replace the screen protector
1,Reliable and cheap battery. This is my second unit. First one is 2 years old and still going strong. Never can have enough batteries.
1,Works great so far! Holding a charge well.
1,It is perfect for my phone! Love the color!!
1,muy bien
1,Quality...there is a difference from these to the cheap wires.
0,Works really good when plugged in to the car. When  running on battery signal is weak .
1,Fuctional perfection.
1,Excellent product. Good quality sound I love it. Easy to connect.
0,"Meh, it was a decent case, it didn't hold stick for that long. I already took it off and put my original case back on. Good concept though"
-1,"I am so disappointed, I must say that it was the easiest protector to that I have ever put on but I noticed right that it seemed to cause a cloudy look to the phones display. I had hoped that it would clear within a couple of days but unfortunately I found that the screen itself just never adhered properly to the device, it came off today, no drops no new case applied, just felt loose and then came off."
1,it is great.
1,Arrived on time and works just great.  It is nice to have a similar holster option with out paying high wireless prices.  Fits just fine.
1,Works fine...
-1,"Two cables, both duds. Both had &#34;not charging&#34; message meaning they are likely not mfi certified as stated. Going back to Amazon. I never seem to learn my lesson that cheaper is almost always too good to be true."
1,Good to use when using your GPS on your cell phone
1,"With two 2A ports this charger will do two tablets at once or speed charge your smart phone. The unit has folding prongs so it travels without damaging your stuff or itself. The best part about it is when I plugged my old iPhone up suddenly the lights went dim in the house and BAM! just like that it converted it into an iPad! Wow! I was wanting a new iPad! SO feeling lucky I plugged in my MP3 player and BAM!, yes BAM!  it turned into a stereo with surround sound and the works!  This thing makes me wish I could plug my car into it.. bet It'd go Ferrari on me.. Hey this charger is the best and I'll likely get another.  I never seem to have enough ports where I want them and with two 2A outputs my wife and I can charge simultaneously. Make the choice for RAVPower and your gear will charge like never before.. heck it might even upgrade itself!"
1,"Great product, great price and fast shipping"
1,too cool with this gadget
-1,In the description of the item it states that it has a protective cover so that it could be waterproof it does not come with a protective cover so that cannot make the item waterproof
-1,"Wasn't satisfactory at all. It quickt o freeze, no front camera & at certain point it will nust go blend"
-1,"Good case, but when I use the flash on the camera, the pictures come out pink because of the rubber part of the case. I have purchased this same case in other colors and never had this problem."
1,"The felt version fits my Cricket Wireless LG Risio very well and can be snapped.  If you are looking for something that is not a clunky cover for this model of LG, this will work.  The fit is snug, so I would go with the felt, not sure how the leather version would work.  To get the phone out, pinch the bottom and it slides out."
-1,"not as slim as the speck case, and the black (intended to be non reflective) area around the camera hole isn't painted completely (white showing through around the edges)."
1,"This is a great little charger to grab free recharging from the sun. I keep this by a window, so it continuously charges itself, so when I need to take it out with me its topped off. Its not a very rapid output, but when you can keep it ready for those times you can't plug in, its a good compromise.<br /><br />The case is covered in padding, but I don't think it could take too much abuse. I think hanging it on a bag like is shown in the directions would be ok, but this isn't for extreme sports.<br /><br />I received one of these at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
1,"This kit has everything you need to turn your phone into an adventure cam for your next outing. It has accessories to attach it just about anywhere on you or your vehicle, and is rugged enough to keep your phone as safe as possible.  I definitely recommend this wholeheartedly.  In the interest of full disclosure, I did receive a promotional discount on this product in order to test it and give my honest opinion of it, which I have done."
1,Good protection
0,"This is my first phone with verizon prepaid.  I used to have an LG volt with Boost mobile which was awesome til Boost mobile completely screwed me over and overcharged my credit card, then suspended my account after disputing the charge.  Horrible customer service from Boost Mobile.  So here I am with Verizon prepaid.  First off, the phone selection sucks!  I didn't like any of the options, but had to pick..so I choose the LG Transpyre since the call sounded ok on my LG volt, and sound quality sucked on my Samsung Galaxy Rush.  Comparing the LG Transpyre to the LG volt, this phone is depressing.  But I decided I wanted to use something more as a phone and texting and use a computer to do all the other fancy stuff.  First off, the colors are so dull!!! I compared the colors to other phones, and with the LG Transpyre, the blues, reds, and whites are just so dull.  Instagram pictures don't even look exciting unless someone filtered the heck out of something.  That's a little depressing to not know how beautiful someone's picture really is.  For the most part it's ok, but once you see how the picture looks on another phone, you'll see that excitement is missing from the Transpyre  There's only 3 screens on each homepage compared to 6 on the LG volt.  So that's a total of 6 screens vs 12 screens.  So if you like to add a bunch of apps like I do, then there isn't as much room on the Transpyre compared to the Volt.  The speakers on this phone are on the back, which I hate, because once I lay it down, it's not as loud.  Call quality sounds staticy for me, I don't know what it is, but most of my calls to Hawaii are just full of static and is very irritating.  People sound muffled to me on this phone.  Loudness of calls is just ok, I wish it could be louder, and clearer more importantly.  Not sure what's going on, but my calls keep dropping when I make calls to Hawaii.  I don't know if maybe it's just me pressing the end button with my cheeks, but the screen usually turns offwhen I'm on a call, so I don't think it's that.  When I look at pictures, the bottom 4th of the screen has the gallery and won't shut off, it's very irritating that I can't see the full picture without zooming in.  Where's the calculator APP!!???!!?  That's the one thing I use the most and I don't see one installed.  I see an NFL app that I will never use though.  Opening the back case is kinda hard and frustrating, you open it by pulling up the part where the usb charger goes.  This screen is about the size of the LG volt, which is pretty big.  BUT, if you are on instagram, the buttoms take up 2 lines at the bottom which ends up making the viewing area actually small, which is frustrating since that means you have to scroll a lot more and can't see as much.  The LG volt only takes up 1 line on the screen and the other buttons are where the LG logo is on the bottom.  Bad design on this phone.  Overall, it's an ok smartphone.  The price is cheaper here than in the Verizon store.   If you buy it from walmart, they include a sim card with the phone."
-1,Love these  stylus pens.Use them on my tablet and phone always.
1,meets my needs
1,"these are the best , wear these for jogging ,boxing and working out - if they ever stop working I will buy another pair that day. (Great product)"
0,Disappointed in this product. This cover makes it nearly impossible to press the buttons on the sides of my phone. It is easily scratched as well. It's nice to look at but not functional.
1,This charger works great and I love that I can plug in all of my devices and charge them at the same time.  It charges just as quickly as the wall outlet.  I would definitely purchase this again.
-1,"It is cheap, and it makes the screen look a little cloudy, its not bad considering there are not a lot of screen protectors for the Nokia."
-1,"When I got it, it was too small even when I made adjustments, make different sizes"
1,I bought this case for my co-worker who needed a different kind of clip for his LG Cosmose 2. I have purchased one like this before and it has served me well over the years. In fact I'm still using it. I highly recommend this case.
1,Excellent product!!!
1,Love the cover for my phone even has place to put cards for shopping.
1,"Unlike some other &#34;certified&#34; cables you can get through Amazon, these actually work, every time I plug them in. I like that this is longer, and actually sturdier, than the original Lightning cable that came with my iPhone 5s."
1,Works perfect
1,"Worked fine. Eventually battery life dwindled, just like the the oem battery. Solid inexpensive replacement."
1,Fit my Note 3 perfectly. Looks like the original to me (says Verizon on it).
1,It works well.
1,Love the case and color!
1,Best 10 foot Data/Charging cable I have purchased
-1,Broke within 2 weeks of use. The white part just snapped...
1,Screen is good! As advertised
-1,"does not work very well, dissconnect continiously, costumer service is great."
1,Works and fit well.
1,So. so cute. I love them. I tie up all my phone wires/Kindle wires too. My favorite one is the pink piggie... LOL
1,This was very easy to install. It has a good fit and very few finger prints get on the glass.
1,Love this case - not too bulky and very protective!
1,"Easy to install, works great.  No screen interference, touch scren responds great."
-1,The phone case was ok. The kick stand broke after about 2 weeks. And the the case did start to chip.
-1,"Sliding in and out of belt clip is difficult and gets stuck frequently, as if it is slightly too tight.  Clip pin started coming out within a month where I would have to manually put it back in, and belt clip broke and fell apart from one fall."
0,the wording on the back of the case is cut off cant see the word beach
1,"I really feel like it protects my phone. Over the weekend I went to a soccer game and had my cleats and my phone in my bag. Normally I would have been nervous about this, since I throw around my bag a lot, but with the case I was fine. It even started raining, but I knew my phone would be safe in side the case. It does do fine with stuff like rain and water being run over it, but it can NOT handle submersion. The water just went in through the zippers. But overall, it is a good bag as long as you are comfortable with the fact that it's not waterproof.<br /><br />The seller graciously gave me a discount so that I could give you this honest and unbiased review.<br />-Thomas Burgess Review"
-1,Neither of the two adapters works. Totally disappointed.
0,The tip of this iphone 6 plus case was to soft and did not hold up. This was ordered for my husband. I had to purchase another one.
-1,My order was missing the stylus.
1,Works just fine good quality
1,"This is a perfect phone holder for your car. Works perfectly. It comes with two magnets to fit any size phone.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Ease of Use/easy to install<br />Small, powerful magnet on the vent clip.<br />Visually appealing while remaining small and mostly unoticeable.<br />Quick - Just pop it on the vent clip and you are done. Takes less than a second.<br />Mobility - Take it in and out of any car. Easy to travel with.<br />Works in any car (with a vent) and with any phone<br /><br />CONS:<br />None<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
0,"Looks nice, soft and rubbery, and inexpensive. Button feedback is very poor with this case, and it's actually tough finding the buttons. Ended up getting a Spigen hard plastic case after using this one."
1,Item as specified.
1,Worked fine for 9-10 months before the regular port stopped working. Outside of warranty. Oh well.  ***UPDATE 9/13*** Anker customer service contacted me with 2-3 days of writing my Amazon review and we were able to come to agree on a resolution. I received a replacement product within 4-5 days and it works great so far.
1,I received a discount for my review of this item. These are the best headphones I have used. They are very comfortable and don't make my ears hurt after wearing them for an extended time. These headphones sound amazing and it was very easy to pair with my phone.
-1,"This sounds ok but cuts out when you walk, the bluetooth isn't very strong. And this one has an annoying green light that flashes and can't be turned off.<br /><br />I bought a different one with prime that was much better. I only bought this one because it was $10 dollars. But it's not worth even that."
1,As advertised.
0,"A few months after purchase, we noticed that one port didn't work. I'm not sure if port failed or if it didn't work from the outset. Could probably return, but life is too short.<br /><br />Have owned for several additional months and remaining ports still work fine.  Aside from the fact that we have one fewer port than we'd intended to buy, we're perfectly happy.<br /><br />Based on other reviews, my experience isn't that unusual.  I'd suggest testing all the ports as soon as device arrives.  Alot easier to return/exchange at that point."
0,"Overall is fine. But it overheats a lot and I can't even record a video because I litterally my hand burning after 2mins of recording.<br /><br />Also the home stops working most of the time.<br /><br />I moved from Samsung to this one, because my one note started failing the frequency due to all the updates.... But must of the technology are doing the same. With product lifecycle less than a year."
1,Works like a charm. I destroyed my previous cable but am happy now.
1,Received my case today & love it!!!
0,"Delivery was perfect.  The quality is not very good.  Very cheaply made, don't expect it to last very long after running and it getting wet."
-1,I didn't like it so I gave it away
-1,"great phone when it first came out, now with all the updates, the phone was very sluggish, and i say was because the phone is no longer working from water damage, fair WARNING to the potential buyers, the phone claims to be water resistant, dont believe the hype, keep the phone away from water, i sent mine in for lcd screen dying, and the was denied for water damage, i took the phone apart when they sent it back and none of the water indicators had been triggered, either behind the battery or hidden inside the phone, but there was severe corrosion on the lcd screen, in other words keep the phone away from water dosent take much and the phone will die."
1,Excellent protection.
1,"Works great for my Eclipse 2009 and my grand daughter Toyota 4 Runner 1999.<br />Now I can hear my music, Pandora, etc."
-1,Phone will not update new BlackBerry software. Can't use. Very poor product. Useless to me. Will not update. Old software. Can not move my old phone information to this new phone.
1,Great.
1,This simple to use Selfie Stick works great. It is very easy to setup with your phone or tablet. I synced it with both just to see. My phone runs on IOS and my tablet is Android. Both synced within seconds and worked perfectly. It has a 35 inch extension. Which is pretty good for a selfie stick. It also slides into its self to make it easy to travel with. It comes with a charging cable so no need to go out and buy one. All in all this selfie stick has a lot to offer for the selfier on the go.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review.
1,"I hadn't owned an HT in over a decade, but I was familiar with Yaesu from my time with a VX-5R as a newly-licensed Technician-class ham in 2001. Recently, I was looking for an HT I could carry with me on backpacking and hiking trips where I thought it would be useful to have in case an FM repeater was the only way of reaching help if needed - as well as an easy way to get NOAA weather reports in case the weather turned ominous. Looking around at the HT landscape, things had definitely changed since the early ‘00s. Built-in TNCs, D-Star, and the proliferation of discount Chinese HTs; I didn’t mind spending a little more for something built to commercial standards, but which manufacturer offered the best value?  I ended up choosing Yaesu’s FT-60R because it did everything I needed, and nothing I didn’t. Reasonably-wide dual band receive coverage (No 162MHz weather coverage on the FT-817ND, Yaesu? Really?), built-like-a-brick construction, and no extra digital modes or features beyond FM voice. I also appreciated the twin analog/volume controls; I “test-drove” a Kenwood TH-F6A that had a menu-set squelch, and coming from the VX-5R I didn’t realize how much I missed that feature until I used the Kenwood. I live in a somewhat rural area, so intermod has never been a significant problem, but the receiver seems somewhat resilient to out-of-band interference - even on top of local peaks inhabited by transmitters that dwarf ham repeaters. The physical size is just perfect; big enough to provide some heft and balance in your hand, but doesn’t feel like you have a block of lead clipped to your belt after a day’s trek.  Finally, the downsides – it does come with an SMA connector, but I think the days of BNCs on ham HTs are numbered. Fortunately, there’s an excellent adapter available from Stephen Gulyas, KC2BHO,  that solves that issue very effectively, and without any stress on the connector.; if you can live with the extra length, Diamond’s RH-77CA makes a world of difference."
1,"You must do a little research on these before successful use though.  The firmware is very similar to UV-5R and is essentially a repackaged UV-5 platform with dual PTT.  The issues with the UV-5 were not corrected in this variant, but it is cheap enough and is an effective rig in amateur service once you are familiar with most aspects and issues common to the Chinese radios.<br /><br />The primary (common to all 6x 82 series radios I have purchased) problem with this is the programming cable connector.  One cannot moidify the cable end to make it work on these radios.  You have to hold the radio connector tight to the radio with your thumb, regardless if the cable mod has been performed or not, to get it ti upload or download.<br /><br />The one anti-gripe I have with this radio is that it is advertised as a 7W HT, when in fact it is 8W on VHF and 7W on UHF.  I am not sure why this fact isn't advertised better."
1,The case itself is fine and it is convenient to have the stand also. But the screen protector shipped with it is quite useless in my opinion. It only covers part of the screen which is very inconvenient especially for texting.
0,Great!
1,"This was a gift for my husband.  I had initially planned on getting an AppleWatch for him, but I hated the rubber looking wrist band on the most affordable model.  I liked the looks of the Pebble and the fact that it would work with most phones.  My husband was thrilled with it!  It looks MUCH nicer than the AppleWatch.  The leather band suited my husband better.  He knows better than I how the apps are with it, but I do know he is pleased with all aspects of this watch.  I would definitely recommend the Pebble to anyone thinking about an AppleWatch and not wanting to spend so much on a rubber watch!"
1,"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
1,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🔥
1,just as advertised and prettier than the Aquapac I have been using for the iPhone. Aquapac does have a wide variety of bags for many different appications
1,great! super long cord and charges quickly.
1,"Work quite well, easy pairing and good volume control, stay in the ear well."
1,Better than expected by far
1,Great!
1,Wonderful!
1,great fits my Golf VII perfect
1,Lov to get another one
-1,Did not fit!
-1,"Very burkly and can't waterproof,DON'T BUY IT"
1,"Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service..."
1,Very good
-1,"Bought four of these cords they look and feel indestructible and have real nice plugs now I'm down to one they last about a week and wasn't handled rough and act as if there shorted out, dissatisfied they usually have a fantastic product I hope this is a one time thing cuz I know how to go somewhere else"
1,Delivered fast and charges everything fast.
1,Very good condition
1,"It was perfect for what I was looking for.  Not too large to be bulky, but sizeable enough to give protecion."
-1,Not sure why I didn't read the review this time! Does not work!!!! Now I have to deal with returns. 
1,It is a great product. My son loves it
-1,"i don't recommend it , I received the power bank damaged from the bottom, and also they don't put plug with the item you need to buy one to charge it."
1,It was a perfect fit thank you....luv it!!
0,"I've had these for nearly a year now. They're pretty great for bluetooth headphones. Mine, unfortunately, didn't come with the extra plug, and the fabric in the actual &#34;ears&#34; of the headphone fell out within three months."
1,Use it on a Honda CRF 250 L and it worsk perfectly. Holds my Garmin Montana very tight.  Also holds my iPhone 6.
1,"It's a great case. Small, cheap, and simple. I recommend it to people who don't like bulky cases"
1,Just received mine.  Took about 3 minutes to set up.  It works perfectly with my Xperia Z3.  I'll use it more as a method to receive notifications vs. as an activity tracker.  So far it's been perfect.  No more missed calls or text!
-1,"Terrible , waste of money mine broke in a week"
1,"Since the screen on the Note 5 comes clear to the edges of the phone, it's hard to hold the phone without touching the edges of the screen and interfering with what you're doing. This case is nice and sturdy and helps you keep a grip on your phone and fingers off the edge of the screen. It isn't bulky and is just right.<br /><br />Pros: good looking, helps keep grip, fits nicely to the phone, not loose feeling like some soft cases.<br /><br />Con's: because of it's slim design, probably won't offer much protection against drops or other possible damage.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend, especially since the stores aren't offering anything for the new phones yet"
-1,"I was very interested to try the F-Color iPhone 6 case in Gold color. The gold color was wonderful as it matched the phone very well. The case is a 2 piece design, where one piece cover the entire edge and the other piece covers the back of the phone. Th two pieces fit together beautifully and it is difficult to see the joints between them. It is so good that it can seem like it is not a case but a part of the phone. Very nice fit and look. There is a hole for the apple logo and the phone looks very good with the case.  I have purchased F-Color cables in the past and they are built to last... so it was not a surprise that this case is tight and strong.<br /><br />Now this case does not have soft rubber cushions and it is not designed for very rough treatment. Other cases may go after the abusive handling and trying to withstand falls from high altitudes. But this is an elegant case that will protect the phone for normal wear and tear. I am very pleased with the look, fit and feel of this case.<br /><br />However, there is a major problem that I encountered. I use 3rd party charger cables and I use F-Color charger cables. I have not had an F-Color cable fail on me yet. I have had to replace many other 3rd party cables as they seem to die to quickly. So it was a surprise to me when I could NOT get the F-Color charging cable to fit into the phone with the F-Color phone case. The F-Color cable has a plastic end that is slightly larger than the original iPhone charging cable. The iPhone cable will fit and function with the F-Color case. The F-Color cable would NOT fit with their own F-Color case. The hole in the F-Color case is just a little bit too small. I was shocked.<br /><br />So I took the phone out and reinstalled the F-Color case as I must have done something wrong. It still would not fit. It seems that the F-Color case is a little longer than the phone and the charger plug can not insert far enough into the case to connect. The hole in the case also needs to bea little larger.  There seemed to be no adjustment or positioning that enabled the charging cable to insert properly.  I am so amazed that their own F-Color case will not work with their own branded cables. My previous case can use the F-Color cables and they fit perfectly.<br /><br />This is the only problem I see with the case. If you only use the original iPhone charging cable then the case works fine. However if you use cables with the larger plastic ends, like I do, then the phone case will not allow the phone to be charged. So this is a major problem and this not acceptable for me. I have returned to my prior case where everything works perfectly. Sorry, but I want my case to work with 3rd party charging cables. The hole in the case should be slightly larger allowing ALL cables to work properly."
1,Works.  Good price.  What can one say?
1,Fast delivery everything as promised.
1,Great for working on computers.
-1,it was not what I expected the top wiring was the incorrect one. I'm look to send it back not a good product .
0,"It protects the screen, I was pleased!"
1,Easy to hook up.  Works great.  This should be included with the xm plug n play.  Don't know why I waited so long to get this.  I had pretty much given up on getting a good signal without static and fade out.  I am enjoying XM radio again.
1,Excellent product  :)
1,Works fine - great price!
1,I got this for a Co worker and she loves it
1,"Arrived quickly, so I was able to get my phone working without delay."
1,"With the previous case, my daughter dropped her phone and cracked the screen; now we don't have to worry about that."
1,meets my needs
1,Works good!
1,"These are great Lightning to USB cable.  As good as the ones you get from Apple, but much cheaper."
1,Love it
1,"This screen is amazing!  Not only does it keep your screen safe but one of the best things I like about it is that it's oil resistant. I used to be a huge pain always needing to clean my phone's screen but since I've had this screen, it never gets dirty or oily! This is way better than the cheap plastic screen protectors or the ones that come with protective phone cases."
1,"Very good, love it."
1,Seems to work fine.  It does charge phones and my tablet faster than the 1 and 2 amp chargers I have.
0,Pros<br />- Simple and cool design<br />- Lightweight<br />- Descent battery life for it's size<br />- The sound quality of the headset was pretty good.<br /><br />Cons<br />- Doesn't go up to 10 meters for wireless range. Maybe more like 4-5 meters.<br />- Leaves a painful sore ear after an hour of usage. Better off for you if you have big ears.
1,Very good
-1,Bought 2 by accident and hated both!
1,Nice case! works well
1,"The tip is a little oversized, so it may not fit some phone cases."
1,Great protection and an invisible finish.
1,Great deal
1,"Works perfectly, battery life is long lasting. The control pane is a little heavy and can get annoying but easily bearable. I would definitely recommend this, worth the money :)"
1,Best tpu cases/brand.
1,Just got this in the mail and it works great! I love the color too. A beautiful purple! The power is strong and charged my phone quickly. Love it!<br /><br />I got this product at a discounted rate in return for my HONEST and UNBIASED review.
1,"Great quality, just what I needed!"
-1,It's backward. Very awkward.
-1,Broke after about a month using it and couldn't get bubbles out of it after it was placed on
-1,Seemed great at first but connection that plugged in to the device is flimsy. My previous cord lasted 2 Years this one didn't last a month
1,A o K<br />LOOKS GOOD FEELS GOOD BUT NUT SURE IF PROTECTS THE PHONE
1,"Great Sound, Great Battery life."
1,Actually really pleasantly suprised for the price!! Really cute design and seems secure.
1,"Easy, fast,all is good."
1,Love it!!!! And it came with a free stylus!!!! It was fast shipping.<br /><br />Pros: fits the iPhone 6+ perfectly.<br />Has a clip to slip it on your belt or pocket<br />And has belt loops so you can more securely attach it to your belt.<br /><br />Cons: nothing wrong wit case. But it is BIG ( but that's Apples fault) 😁<br /><br />I received this product for a fair review.
-1,"Not particularly thrilled with the performance of this battery bank. I purchased this in March and have used it probably twenty times or less. It no longer will charge my phone. I suspect something is wrong with the USB port, as the light will only turn on if I hold the cord carefully in it. Even then, it does not charge. I will try to see if this will be covered under warranty but for now I cannot recommend it.<br />For the time that it was working, it performed decently enough. It took forever to charge, though. I would go for a better bank if I had to purchase again."
1,just what I needed.
-1,"I really wanted to like this cable. It looks so cute with the stripes and I thought we could finally prevent the fraying we encounter from all other cables... One night I wanted to move the charger from one room to the next, but it was so hot to touch. My husband suggested it might be the power box and not the cable. So we switched boxes and it still overheated. We used an old cable on both boxes also and it didn't overheat. Maybe ours was the only one defective but we didn't want to chance it and had it returned."
1,Excellent product and Seller<br />Perfect fit easy to apply
0,"it was ok for price but i terrible graphics , had to return it"
1,"I have been using this charger for several months. I've set up a charging table where my family of four and guests routinely plug in iPhones. an iPad, androids, and various bluetooth devises and rechargeable speakers. The Anker PowerPort has performed flawlessly whether one or 6 products have been plugged in for charging."
1,Bought it to hold my sony action cam along with all my attachments...plenty of room and more!
1,Easy to install. Not too bulky.  Fits in your pocket nicely.  Dropped it on a concrete floor with no damage to the phone.  Replacement of the screen protector is a real plus.
1,Excellent product. .charge fast
1,"I was excited that this iPhone 5s case came before the time expected, but I'm not too happy about my Beats By Dre headphones not being able to plug into my iPhone 5s due to the bulkiness of the case."
1,Great case.  It is like my others for Samsung phones but this one fits better for some reason on the small HTC Incredible (Verizon).
-1,"SORRY, I read the reviews and really wanted to like it, the materials seemed ok, just did not like the fit much. Still prefer my OB commuter and Defenders for S5/6 models. Not being a hater, just did not work for me, sent back for full and ez refund. :)"
1,good quality and good price
1,Good!
1,I loved this cover. It arrived on time and it was exactly how it was described. I bought this so it could be a heavy duty cover because I have two toddlers and because I can put like money or a credit card without worrying it will fall. If you want it for other reason than don't get this one. I love it.
1,"This case looks amazing and fits perfect, but is not very comfortable.  There is a premium look to this case.  It is fairly easy to put on and take off.  The back has a good grip to it.  The problem I had with the case is the aluminum sides are not very comfortable while holding."
1,Cheryl
1,Love it!!!  Just as nice if not nicer than my hubby's Otterbox and less than half the price.  Good deal...good price....good service.....what else could a girl ask for.....
1,"Nice, solid plastic case. Looks awesome, and I love the feel of the buttons. Makes this glossy phone a lot safer and easy to handle."
1,Fits perfect with all the buttons aligned. The hard case incloses a basic silicone case and the colors are as shown.
1,Great
-1,It is already cannot charge. Not good
-1,Dis colored within a few weeks
-1,"The &#34;power&#34; button on the side wont work with the case on. However, I needed the case asap for vacation and had to use it any how. I tried to fix it in multiple ways but it just wouldn't work.  Super bummed :("
1,nice product
1,Delivery was perfect and the product is really cool<br />The sale rep was very effective
1,Another good chose as they quality is excellent.
1,Really nice mouse for the price. you can also adjust the pointer speed. fits nice in the palm smooth on a lot of surfaces
1,already scratched my screen but no visible damage to screen it self. Easy placement and no bubbles
1,"So far so good, it fit perfectly & it is an original otterbox."
1,"I really like it. It's made with good quality material. It has three pieces and a stand that can pop out. I got it with a promotional code, put it is worth the price."
1,Use it everyday
1,"so let me explain my delimma. a waterproof, shockproof, dust proof phone case is often, unfortunately, sound proof also. not so good fo ra phone! but i work a lot in a wood shop and am building a tiny house on the weekend, so a bumper type case is just simply not enough. this is THE case. it has a hard inner layer surrounded by a soft layer kind of like an otter defender. but its not as bulky. and its more stylish. Am i the only one who doesnt want my phone to look like my M&M's? then the last piece,of  which three are sent with it , is the back-plate, and it  protects the back of the phone. so, unlike a defender it is EASY to get it in and out of the inner hard layer, and the back plate provides the protection for the back on the outside. its not just decorative. it would be apt to say this is a three part case. and it looks great. a little rugged, but stylish too. not to thick. great protection. there is a hole in the home button so your touch ID works. the ports are covered with soft plastic covers so things cant get in there. and call quality is fine, its the first thing we tested. highly recommend.  Update. I've dropped my phone numerous NUMEROUS times with this case on. I've actually broken the case in fact, but my phone is fine. And I'm a tall guy, I'm 6' 2&#34;. I've dropped it standing, tried to catch it, and knocked it across the room into concrete floors. And the phone is fine. Love it. ;)"
1,"I laughed at the device when I first used it and it told me just how long I should expect to be in traffic. The joke was on me when it was 100% correct - and it continues to amaze me.<br /><br />You'll read a lot of negative reviews about not being able to change the color of the maps (like you're able to do with previous TomTom operating systems) but really, who cares? The speed at which this locates you and maps your route is amazing. Yes, you can only access the traffic data if your smartphone is paired through bluetooth, but the amount of data it uses is actually incredibly small. I'm talking under 10 megabytes with a month of constant use!<br /><br />Even if you have an existing TomTom, you'll be amazed by this device, once you get used to the new and much different interface. Searching for points of interest is done in a common sense method now.<br /><br />Oh, one last  thing, you CAN now map a route through the TomTom app (available in the play store, and presumably the apple store) and as soon as your phone and gps reconnect, the route you planned on your phone is instantly sent to the device, and you're in your way."
1,Love it! I used it for a few months until it broke..but honestly it lasted so much longer than I expected it to.
1,"Excellent watch, but not waterproof! My watch is now dead because I didn't know that the only way it is waterproof is for the plastic door to the charging port to be shut!  It is not rubber sealed, just plastic.  The ads touted that the watch was waterproof to one meter for 20 minutes.  I had taken several showers with the watch with no problems at all. I had taken service hours with the watch with no problems at all. But, I took it for a 20 minute swim and it got soaked. It never recovered. Other than that the watch was great.  I was under the impression it was waterproof.  Only on their website does it say that the charging door must be shot to be waterproof. I assumed that they had sealed the area around the charging port. But I was wrong. Later I bought a cheap Chinese replacement for $19 but the sophistication was way below that of the Sony.  The Sony has no microphone and no speaker you cannot use the watch as a phone. But it does alert you that phone calls are coming through you can read your texts and it alerts you when you recieve email. This works very well in an office environment where you do not want all your neighbors hearing your conversation from your wrist watch. The watch simply vibrates and alerts you that your phone is ringing. Quite sophisticated and just what I want.<br />Only wish I had known the conditions for being waterproof!"
0,The band broke after just a few days
1,"arrived quickly, work well"
1,"Great, Simple, Blue."
1,Great product
1,"Love this car mount! I love that it's easy to move from one air vent to the other. And my phone REALLY sticks to it, it will not budge or fall off.<br /><br />You put this little magnet sticker on the back of your phone. It was a tight fit, but I managed to put mine underneath the battery back of my LG G4 and it still closes fine. Then put the magnet on any vent, and your phone will snap right to it when held within a few inches of it.<br /><br />-1 Star because there isn't a lot of room for maneuverability, depending on the location of your car vents, you may not like the angle that your phone is sitting at. In that regard, a dash or window-mounted holder is much more flexible. But I don't like the look of those mounts, and they are harder to move from car to car.<br /><br />Also, since it's summer the A/C running keeps my phone really, really cold when its on the air vent mount. Hoping no issues in the winter when I'm using heat."
-1,"ONE YEAR UPDATE:  Noticed that my phone was wobbling so I inspected & found that the ring that tightens to the swivel ball was completely split on one side.  Good thing I checked or I would've lost my phone on the highway!  Unit has not been abused or over-stressed, and is stored inside on my bike.  Don't waste your money on this -- especially if you value your phone or GPS!  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Securely holds my Samsung S4, or my daughter's S5.  Clamp fits fine on the slimmer sections of my handlebars, but not big enough for the thicker center section.  Because I had to mount it on the slimmer angled portion of the handlebars, there's not enough articulation to hold the phone directly facing me.  Even so, the screen is easily visible while riding, just on an angle.  I would buy this again."
1,Worked out good and liked the screen protector
-1,Very cheap thin plastic definitely for looks with no protection.
1,"Damn good little phone. No internet connection which if fine with me. I can wait to get to a computer for that. My favorite feature on this phone is that it beeps when the battery is running low. Calls are clear, texts work great. This is the BEST basic phone I've ever owned and I've owned 4 or 5 since 2008."
1,It's awesome and fits in you purse which is great
1,Nice system works great
1,Saved a lot of money! Almost purchased a new one at a store for $40.00! Free shipping! Can't beat that!
1,"I ordered the wrong size for my phone, asked for an exchange and received one with no problems. the glass fits iPhone 6 perfectly as long as you put it on carefully and correctly."
1,Fell apart
1,"Solar panel doesnt seem to charge efficently, but the design and quality of this charger is very good."
1,"[[VIDEOID:5698b5f7fbc30e7ecc9a7aee3ccda268]] We were not sure what to expect when received this product for review.  We have tested a few waterproof cases and pushes so we were ready to take this on a trip to Mexico for the beach and pool. The case did not disappoint . As we show in the video, you are able to actually submerge the case and whatever is inside without water damage.  We were able to fit a Galaxy 6 in a normal case (non Otterbox type) easily with some credit cards, ID and cash.  Using the strap for my arm was not needed, but tests with it were successful. Most people will either hand carry it or use the lanyard I imagine.  The lanyard worked fine and was long enough to wrap around my neck for the walk.<br /><br />One benefit I didn't see another review discuss, which we show in the video, is your ability to actually interact with the touchscreen on your phone while it is in the Wizen bag.  I demo how we were able to unlock, open the camera, move screens around and more.  This is a great added benefit of being able to not only protect it but use the camera.  The back of the bag has the built in slot where you should place the camera area so we knew there had to e a reason.<br /><br />The locks on the top of the box are sturdy but if you break one of those then the case pretty much becomes useless since it holds the seal. Make sure to take care of those when opening and closing the bag up.<br /><br />Overall we are happy and impressed with this and it goes on our travels that involve the pool and water now."
-1,its a nice case but just like any of these types of cases ive had people cant really hear you on the phone. it is water proof which is nice and the case is made well but whats the point if no one can hear you talk.
1,Easily the best and heftiest charger I've ever had.
1,love it
0,Great for protecting against scratches
1,Great gift for a friend
1,"I am super delighted with this case/cover for my IPhone 6 plus.  Slim, well made and protects nicely.  Granddaughter has already dropped it and kept it safe. I'm not crazy about those heavy otter box types (bulky).  This one is light weight and colors are perfectly matched (I've got gold). Plus I can change the back cover if I'm in the mood for black or silver.  Great product. Thanks."
1,"Simple, cheap, effective."
1,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.i love this case on my phone .. it snaps on easy and holster onto my hips with ease.. very sturdy and phone wont be able to fall or isnt loose..
-1,"Lasted 6 weeks, then broke."
-1,If I don't have my phone close to the ear piece the music fades in and out... The fast forward and rewind button only work sometime. As far as the sound quality it's great.
1,Very nice  headset
-1,Bought and retuned 3 of these. The pull out  thingie does not stay locked so it cannot be hung from a belt or purse. Considering what they charge for that &#34;convenience&#34; I say save your money. I thought it might be a fluke but happened on more than one case. (One of the cases was returned because the pattern did not look like the online picture. The other two had the problem mentioned above  )
1,I've had my jawbone UP24 for about a month. So far I love everything except the food tracker. It's difficult to figure out and not as accurate as it should be.
1,"Purchased this to use with a Raspberry Pi. Makes a nice little portable system with minimal reconstruction. Just need a HDMI and USB adapter and you're all set, plug in the Pi and go."
1,"These were pretty good, but the max volume needed to be better so that my friends who I game with can hear me better."
1,Arrived on time and works great!
1,Well finally after 3 try's this one works! I've gone without a charger for over a month and it was getting a little tiring because returning and re-buying takes so much time waiting to return and waiting for it to be delivered. But now I think everything will be fine. So far this cable does fit and it does work. Thanks to Amazon customer service rep (Norman?) I think his name was??
1,Very good
1,"Great purchase, quick delivery. Thank you."
-1,Didn't work. I doubt it's compatible with apple products at all.
1,Beautiful !!
1,Nice price.  Works as described.
1,"This is a great product and works well on a variety of printers, which I needed. It also does great with a wireless mouse."
1,"No wonder these are so highly regarded in the OP forum, the quality is amazing, the fit is perfect, tight so it won't slip out on its own yet really easy to take off if you want to show someone your amazing One and the Sandstone back. The hue of the case might be a little more clear than what you see in the picture, or at least that was the case with mine (Navy Blue), and gladly I can't report anything regarding the cell protection it provides since I haven't let it fall down on a hard surface yet, but if you're clumsy you might want to look for a little more protection, or the version with the corner bumpers.  09/15/2016: After more than a year and a half, this case is still working greatly and barely showing any signs of wear, even though I carry my cell in a waist pack with a bunch of hard items around it. I barely use my flip cover anymore as this is so much more convenient."
1,"Holds the phone great, but the rotation screw comes loose pretty often so the phone will twist sideways.<br /><br />Also somehow didn't think about the fact that this will permanently affect the little fabric that protects the cd player from dust and such."
1,They do what they are supposed to and last.
1,It was the wrong item. I thought i was ordering a phone case. I was disappointed.
-1,case is very thin and provides very little protection against drops...!!!!
1,Beautiful little case. My wife loves it.
-1,"This case looks very nice because you can see how pretty the phone is underneath while also providing protection. The downside is that it has rough spots where the mold was detached during the process of making it. They aren't horrible spots, just not what i normally expect from Spigen. The other downside is that dust and junk gets between the phone and case very easily. It requires taking the phone out and cleaning it every couple days.  UPDATE: I have moved this to one star because after having it on the phone for about a week I noticed today that there appeared to be smudges on the back of my phone under the case. So I took off the case and it wasn't smudges, but instead the case had left a sticky residue on the phone. The inside of the case felt sticky to the touch, and the dotted texture you see in the pictures was coming off. Very disappointed because I wanted the clear case to see the phone itself, but this one is not going to be it for me."
-1,One works the other doesn't
1,I love this! The cord is nice and long and much thicker than the crap that Apple gives you. I highly recommend this.
-1,Its okay ..
-1,This is not a really good case bz if u drop it...it break inside so i dont reccomend to get this case
1,Exelente
1,"Wireless connection with the ipad was an issue  and was resolved after contacting their company. However, even though &#34;Untangled Pro&#34; is recognized on Samsung 5, it doesn't work. I do love the wireless feature and think it is absolutely wonderful! My soon to be 4 year old is quite happy with it. It's a bit loose on her bc she's tiny for her age, but she makes do. Also love that it has the wire/plug option. Great headset! Awesome customer service!"
1,As other people mentioned in their postings this fits great.  It is just a hair thinner than Apple's bands but so far I have really enjoyed wearing it.
1,Very nice case and still shows off my d Brand skin.
1,Works like it says. The only thing is that it decreases the volume of the speakers.
1,"I love this product.  I have a Samsung Note 4, & I hate cases because they make the already large phone too bulky for my liking.  The iRing gives maximum versatility as a kickstand in multiple positions.  It allows me to carry the phone across my knuckles & still have both hands available.  iRing also sits the camera lens above the table so you avoid scratches to the camera lens.  Great purchase."
1,The stylus is great.  My only problem was I didn't get a pink one I ordered.
-1,This phone gets so hot that my daughter has to hold it with a towel.
-1,"I received my case with high hopes for it. I was thoroughly disappointed by the fact that the inner cover didn't even fit my iPhone 6, and the snaps didn't get snap on the bottom so there was a gap. Because there is a built in screen protector, this gap made it impossible to type without pressing ridiculously hard. I can hear the popping noise whenever I tap my phone screen as if the built in screen protector is being pushed back in. Not to mention, the screen protector came damaged with a smear that I can't get out no matter how vigorously I rub it with a electronic screen cleaning wipe. Very disappointed with the touch sensitivity/fit and will return this item."
1,"It holds up my phone very well! My only concern with it is you have to keep adjusting the center, but other than that, it works perfectly! Definitely buy it!"
1,"The sound is great on my iPhone 4s. But every time I make a whatsapp call, Viber or any other free calls I have to turn it OFF AND ON to hear through  the Bluetooth  when I get a regular call. And sometime the Bluetooth will  disconnect by it self"
1,So much better than the clip kind.
1,"Very good cable, long and good quality"
-1,Does not work with my IPad!
1,Exactly as described and good price.
1,"I bought this case awhile back and have used it on and off for several months. I didn't originally intend to buy the mint color, but because it was on-sale and I am a fan of mint colored items, I decided why not. The case itself is very sleek. It looks strong and sturdy, which is something you definitely want for an iPhone. It's incredibly easy to slip onto your phone. You basically just pop it in. There are black rubber grips located around the sides that frame the phone. I believe what's unique about the case (besides the slot that allows you to prop up your phone to watch videos) is that there is a dual layer that supposedly protects your phone better than most other cases.<br /><br />Because this case looks quite firm, I would periodically exchange this case for more stylish and glittery ones. I learned my lesson after I dropped my phone once in a glittery case and had my screen shattered whereas I dropped my phone several times (yikes) in the Obliq case and still had my phone stay in one piece.<br /><br />The kickstand feature of this case is also a big plus. The case comes with a plastic card that you can easily slip into the slot on the back, but any credit card will do. Overall, I really recommend this case because it seems like it has protected my phone FAR better than most other cases."
0,Coming from the M50 this is a downgrade but still worth the the price and buy.
1,Great phone especially for the price.
1,"Lost my first one.  Loved using as it provided an excellent charge option for trips. My teenagers borrowed it from me for the last year and lost it.  Bought two this time, one for the kids and one for myself.  Great price for this level of charge device"
1,Great price for the protection.
1,"It falls off 10 times already, I figured it out to stabilized,how? repositioning, tighthen it, sometimes re rotate, my body change, I got sweat and shaken when running. Overall this is the best Armband ever in my experience!! I will recommenr this to my friend, look!! it has LED in it, everytime I look with other joggers and runners, they let their screen on as their lights at night.har har har😃🌃🌌🌃🌌🌃🌌🌃🌌🌃🌌🌃🌌🌃🌃🌃🌌🌃<br />I like the color gray or silver, and green lights! the design is perfect! Congrats! with your attractive product! I do really enjoy it and keeps me exercise more! Atleast one guy ask where I got it😃I am a night guy  because of my work schedule."
1,Awesome case! Feels amazing and looks great!
-1,Did not fit my phone at all...this case is not for a s6
1,"I measured my wrist at just under 6&#34; and the small was a little snug when I got it but loosened a little bit after a few weeks. The heart rate monitor built into some of the newer models would be nice, but at prices over $100 I can't afford them. The UP24 is great for my purposes (silent alarm, tracking sleep, counting steps) and at around $40 it's definitely well worth the price.  A tip, I didn't realize for the first 2 or so weeks that I used the UP24 that you can calibrate your band so it better calculates the distance you're walking. I have a fairly long stride for my height so on a 5km walk the app was only registering about 4km travelled. To calibrate your band: 1. Do a walk or run in stopwatch mode - short press once then long press the button on the band until the sun blinks.   It helps to have an alternative app running to map your distance (Map my run, Nike+) or to just calculate it later on Google Maps 2. Long press the button to end the workout 3. Tap the little white band icon in the top right corner of the app 4. Tap the black and white band icon in the top right corner of the open menu (next to YOUR NAME Up24) 5. Choose the calibrate option in the center and follow the on-screen instructions"
1,"The batteries are great.  I am a rather heavy user.  My battery might run dead about 4-5pm during a work day when I have a battery saver app running...the battery would run dead at 12pm if I didn't.  (in comparison, my friend, who has the same phone, has battery until night).<br /><br />It is hard to compare these batteries to the OE battery because of the added apps, etc through the years.<br /><br />I can say that the batteries are NOT cheap batteries.  They last just as long as my 1 year old OE battery.<br />The addition of the charger is great!  I always have fresh batteries ready.<br />Also the charger has a USB slot for charging an additional device...which is a great extra benefit when you are traveling."
1,GREAT easy to install good directions easy to clean<br />Thanks Gil Giuliani
1,This is a very nice screen protector.  It is smooth and glossy and very nice to the touch.  This protector included wing tabs for easy application.  The wing tabs were very helpful in applying the protector.  It kept your fingers off of the actually screen protector and it was very easy to line up.  Another nice feature of this product is that it went on very smoothly and pressing a credit card on it smoothed out just about every single bubble.  There were a few small ones left but that was a result of the one flaw.  This product came in a three pack and I used all of them before I got it right. The wing tabs are great for applying the product but once it is on it is difficult to pull the wing tabs off.  They are very sticky and on the first try pulled the protector back off of the phone so you have to re apply the top and bottom.  It also left a lot of glue residue behind on the product which was difficult to get off.  The second try did not leave as much residue but pulling off the tabs compromised the one corner and it did not fully adhere to the phone.  On the third try I put the protector on as before but this time I pulled the wing tabs off at the sticky part (had to &#34;pick at it&#34; with my fingernail) and that seemed to work best. No real residue left behind and the corner was not compromised.  There are some very small bubbles that I was not able to remove but it is not a problem for me.
1,Easy to apply and works very well.
-1,"Not really for a note 4. You can jam it in there, but it is made for a smaller phone. Cheap quality. Got what I paid for."
1,Love it!
1,It works well o can charge at least 4 things rather quickly
-1,"The one we received was not for my phone. Either we ordered the wrong one or was sent the wrong one. It wasn't noticed until the phone was taken apart. Unless you know exactly what you are doing, I would not recommend ordering this part. The screws are extremely tiny & different ones for different places. If its an iPhone Apple will not touch it if you get into trouble & can't get it back together. I had to get a new phone."
1,"I received this product at a discount for my honest review.<br /><br />It's always a good idea to have an external charger handy when you're out and about and on the go. And believe me when I say, I am almost always out and about and on the go! I decided to give this portable charger a go.<br /><br />They describe the charger as:<br /><br />-ULTRA-HIGH CAPACITY 15000 mAh - No more hugging walls break free from the outlet! Tech Tribe's external charger offers enough power to charge an iPhone 6 (7 x`s), iPhone 6 plus (5 x`s), iPad Air (1.5`s)<br />-DUAL USB PORTS - 5v 1 amp & 5v 2.1 amp You can charge your smart phone and tablet at the same time or charge 2 smart phones. Very convenient when you are on the go. Never let your devices run out of juice again. You can even charge PSP, iPod, Kindle or any other device that is charged with a USB cable.<br />-AIRCRAFT GRADE ALUMINUM - If lightweight and portable weren't enough this top of the line charger is also ultra-durable. The case is made out of heavy duty aircraft grade aluminum for added strength and durability. Also it will not overheat like many chargers with plastic cases.<br />-LIFETIME WARRANTY - Make this the last charger you ever buy. If for any reason your Tech Tribe Razor is found faulty you qualify for a replacement under our warranty. We only require you to register the product within your first 30 days of purchase and you are covered for life.<br />-WHY SHOULD YOU BUY OUR CHARGER - Lets face it when you search amazon for a high capacity charger you will find many big brand names with great offerings. However, when we compared the competition we realized the quality for most of the chargers was very low, including the use of plastic cases in order to save on production cost. The plastic typically gets hot while you are charging your device. Also the internal components on most power banks were put together very crudely. We saw the opportunity and would like to introduce Tech Tribe Smart Boost, a high quality charger with aluminium casing and sleek design. Overall a great value!<br /><br />I have both Apple and Android products so having a device that charges both is necessary. The Tech Tribe handles all devices flawlessly and recharged them in good time. It did not overheat, which I find many devices do.<br /><br />The only downfalls to this charger are you have to carry the charging cords of your devices with you, the Apple ones especially. And they say it is lightweight but I found it to be a little on the heavy side.<br /><br />The long and short of it is it works just like they say it will. Don't go without power ever again! Pick up this external charger and your worries will end."
-1,It looked solid when I assembled it but head mount started to drop. You have to constantly tight it .
1,A great help in tracking and motivation!
1,Fast shipping. Solid product.
1,"Worked well, but now has problems"
1,My ipad is like new again this replacement part worked out really well. Saved me a lot of money on costly repairs.
1,"I like the finer tip in these for writing on my iPad. I have other similar with more fat rounded tips, but these give finer control. My son tried one and liked enough to keep it, so they have the millennial stamp of approval along with the baby boomers. Good product at a good price."
1,I tried 2 other S5 flip cases with a spot to put my driver's license and they both broke in a few days.  My BUDDIBOX is now 2 years old and going strong.  I have dropped my phone several times and it never gets damaged. The BUDDIBOX is the BEST protection ever for my Samsung S5.  I purchased 2 more BUDDIBOXs for family members phones and they love them!
-1,Seems poorly made. Slips out of the holster too easily. Case/holster is too slick... it slides around way too much. Not rubberized at all. This unit also doesn't stand in the landscape orientation too well without falling over all the time.
1,Very good
1,"This case is exactly as shown in photos. Made well,  fit is perfect and incredibly well priced. I put a tempered glass screen protector on my Note 5 and with this case there is no need whatsoever to buy an otter box at 5 times the cost."
-1,Way too bulky and heavy. Touchscreen doesn't respond as they claim it does.
1,Hi quality case
1,"If your like me you have probably searched for hours, and bought many phone cases that after a couple uses you just don't like! Well I have personally found the phone case that is perfect for me! The Phonefoam Secret Case is perfect for my and my busy lifestyle. It provides rugged, durable protection for my phone, yet it is multifunction and looks sleek and stylish! The Phonefoam case isn't big and bulky, you will have no problem fitting the phone in your pocket still, but it has foam cushion to support your phone and prevent breaks from dropping. It has an amazing feel to the case, it soft and comfortable to use my phone now. It also has a convenient slot for your drivers license, or credit or debit card that is hidden! So if you loose or misplace your phone, your important card will be hidden, and I doubt the person will have time to find it before you report it missing. That to me is a huge plus! It also has a nice compartment with a mirror and can hold any other cards you need to take on the go with you. The Phonefoam case is so stylish and cute, I love packing my phone inside, it is easy to put on your phone, and easy to take off. It fits perfectly over your phone and doesn't mess with the function of any of the side buttons. I can also plug my phone into my charging dock without removing the case, and the cable fits in perfectly as well. I feel so safe now<br />Packing my phone and important card, because I know my phone is protected and my card is hidden as well. I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. The price however does not affect my opinion of the product."
-1,this was a terrible case. does not fit the iphone 6 and it broke when i tried to put it on.
1,Awesome case
1,"Great, good seller."
1,Received and good
0,The case is great only reason I gave 3 starts is because my case is not smoothed to perfection . A lot of the cut outs are not completely smoothed along the back
1,Can't beat the product and price!
1,Great product.
0,"disappointing!!!!<br /><br />i can fold a dollar bill to make it fit, but there's no way it can be called a Money Clip,<br /><br />it does hold two cardsneatly"
1,Love this cable.  Extra long and the lights let you know when your fully charged
-1,"When i tried to used it, it wont work, it was damaged"
-1,"Don't buy, doesn't work."
1,"It works, it is cheap, and it is a great value considering the price."
1,"Great product!  Clear, undistorted sound quality when streaming music from a tablet."
0,Does it have the dust covers for the battery port and headphone port
1,"It's unfortunate that this phone is not Sprint compatible and I'm unable to activate it with my current carrier. That being said, it is a nice phone. Decent size. Has a great camera (the camera is fabulous! better than the one on our iPhone 6) and is an affordable low price. Just do the research before buying to make sure you can use it with your carrier."
1,One of my favorite gadgets!!
1,Excellent cover for the price
1,This product deserves the five star rating.
-1,It is not a fast charger at all! I can get about 10% an hour. While my other charger can go from 0% to 100% in just over an hour.
1,Great item
1,GOOD.
1,Very nice
-1,It does not protect your privacy as well as the tech armor. For the price I thought it would be better but nope. You can see everything from the sides.
0,"Really cute case, however, it didn't take long for the closing tab to begin cracking. i have replaced it with a leather case."
-1,"Very cool design, but unfortunately lacking in quality and any form of protection. Lasted less than 2 days before the corner split from regular use. And I am extremely careful with my electronics."
1,"Great case,fits well."
1,This is exactly what I needed.  Works just as described.
1,They worked
1,I was a bit surprised when the first one stopped working but then I got a replacement in just a few days and it's awesome
0,The case  doesn't last  long
-1,"Bottom front lip is thin/flimsy leaving the from exposed, this also curves into Spen area.<br /><br />Normally these cases are on point, they refunded me the purchase price at least.<br /><br />Will order again once they fix the manufacturing defects."
-1,2 of the 3 charging heads broke off within a week under normal use. The level of quality is reflected in the price. Be very gentle if you choose to purchase.
1,Very good phone . The best prices and especificaciones.-
1,Product as described
1,Awesome case! Love how it really secures the phone and has full coverage
1,easy to install with the instructions included
1,I love how fast this thing charges but I kind of wish the cord had a little less resistance so it did not pull on the part that connects to the phone so hard when stretched out
-1,Already broken in same place as the other 2 i have had awful product
1,Increased the signal on my cellular game camera by 2 bars!<br /><br />I'm using it on a SpyPoint 4g game camera. Increased the signal by 2 bars and works great.
1,Perfect fit.  Loved the variety of colors to chose from !
-1,Pay the extra dollar for the slightly better one from someone else. This one is garbage.
1,Great!
0,Wrong size
1,Good
1,Works well
1,It was exactly what I expected it to be love love love it.
1,"Great little charger. Finally got a chance to test this little guy yesterday when we had a power age due to wind storm in the Pacific NorthWest - which means mostly cloudy weather. Even though there were only sun breaks ( a common weather term int he PNW) this little charger was able to keep two Ipads and two Iphones charged all day (does two devices at once).  So I cannot speak to longevity - as I just bough tit - but so far so good - great actually. Very portable, I will take it on my next hiking trip or any other trip for that matter."
1,"Cool design, comfortable in hand."
1,Good
1,"A must have for Iphone 6 + as the bare chassis is slick and will slide out of your hand. This full carbon fiber case is incredibly light, adding limited bulk to the already big phone. The case has a great tactile coating making it tacky and easy to grip. The chrome apple logo is hidden by the case which is my preference as the logo is the tackiest and least aesthetic appealing thing about Iphone 6s."
1,Son loves his case.
1,"This item was bought for a family member  who has a gt-i8190<br /><br />The battery that was supplied by samsung was utter trash no matter what settings i put on her phone the battery would still drain quickly, and it would almost always deplete it 100% after a simple 30 minute conversation. The regular battery samsung included would not even last through an entire day causing the phone to be unusable to a certain point.<br /><br />This battery made things much more easier it made the leather case that was being used before useless because this battery has to be used with the backplate it comes with otherwise the battery will fall out. Before  using the standard 1200 mag battery from samsung the phone was being charged twice a day sometimes 3 times a day.<br /><br />With this battery the phone went from being charged 2-3 times a day to once every 3 days. And this is all with playing some games, texting, and a few calls actually on the 3rd the the battery is still good but its at about 20%. Since the battery is bigger and has more MAH it requires this to be charged double so normally i leave it charging overnight on the 3rd day.<br /><br />I have only used this for 3 weeks, i was a little concerned first because of how some chinese off brand batteries are however this was improve the usage of the phone it was for by far.  If i have severe decline in the battery i will update my review but i hope the battery at least last a good year.<br /><br />It doesn't appear some manufacturers make leather cases to accomdate a larger back cover like this however i found a solution for my family member to use her old leather case. Since the other case has a back cover glued onto the case i simply ripped it off and i crazy glued this battery cover to the leather case and now she can use her old leather case with this extended battery."
-1,I didn't work
1,"I have been use it for a year already ,comfortable for watch movie!"
1,Great tools.
1,Great radio!!!
1,"What an awesome, affordable product. Comfortable and do not fall out during physical activity. Just put these to the test during my run and they're so ideal that it would be ridiculous to throw your money towards something more expensive and unnecessary.<br /><br />For the price, these have a great sound, great battery life, and are extremely comfortable and don't fall out!<br /><br />Buy these now!"
1,"I have not used this product yet, but my daughter had one exactly like it when we went to Italy.  It works great for curling irons, camera batteries and cell phones.  It was always charging something!"
1,Easy to put on.
1,works.  durable.  no complaints.
1,Bought for the whole family
1,"The vent option ended up being a good option as I thought it would block the AC, but it doesnt.  It just doesnt hold so well when trying to place the phone on it.  Once in place.....very secure!"
0,So I bought this thing about a month ago or so but the belt clip didn't last two weeks of me getting in and out of my work trucks. Broke and now I still have to have it in my pocket. And it seems to be for left handers because when I pull it out of the main cover and it power button seems to be on the wrong side
1,It looks nice but if you own an apple watch spot band you know what it feels like this ban is thin but I was told by the makers that it would not break and it is good quality and tested I will try for a week and give an update
0,Protects from scratches but the corners peeled up quickly even though I followed the instructions exactly :( Does not last long.
1,Great
1,"I received a free item to review.<br /><br />A lot of so-called athletic/exercise headphones claim to be sweat-resistant  but  the reality is their thin cords, lightweight and exposed cushions and controls  start to break down  -or get smelly-funky – fast, especially in warmer weather.<br /><br />The connecting band on these wireless phones is short and relatively stiff – with the kind of hard plastic coating I can easily wipe-down after a workout and clean with paper towel and a small dab of detergent.<br /><br />The Bluetooth pairing and functioning is fine with my Samsung Android phone. The sound quality is not as good as phones I use for ‘serious listening’ but it’s more than adequate for exercising where there’s a lot of background noise from my treadmill - and I’ll take durability over less than top-shelf sound for this purpose.<br /><br />There’s a simple, easy to grab volume adjustment along the outside of one phone rim – that’s all I need.  Forget about phone calls – the world can wait for the hour I’m exercising."
1,Love this case... fast service...
1,Great !
0,"This product does protect it from water. The only thing once under water I could not use the screen for anything, so I would have to start a video above the water then take my phone underwater to do a video and this was OK but I really wanted to take pictures under water."
1,"I love it !! It's so pretty , and it's colors are beautiful and bonus its protects your phone to the max"
-1,"I've had two break, and the company's response when I contacted them about it was to give me a link to buy more.  I did, but I'm not buying Jarv products again."
1,"After I received this watch on time, I configured it with my Sony xperia z2. Everything went on smoothly.<br />Since April this year to date, I don't have any complaints. Again, I recommend it to everyone."
1,Definitely better in and output the the one that comes with the UV-5R radio
1,This is an amazing little device. It powers on automatically when plugged in and connects to my phone everytime after establishing an initial connection. The sound quality is great. I use it in my 2010 Nissan Altima and I have a LG G3 cell phone. I have no complaints!
1,Charges my iPhone 6 Plus at least 3 times. A con is that it takes many hours for the actual power bank to charge.
-1,It was not as expected.  It was made very cheaply.
-1,"This is the second one I got after the first one crapped out on me. Just stopped working one day, just like the previous one did. Will never buy again."
1,"Purchased this phone from the Apple Store and it was a pleasant experience. The larger screen size is very nice and comfortable to use. The design of the phone is thin, light, modern and beautiful. It is at times slower than iphone 5 and even iphone 4. There are many dropped calls, and not good reception while talking most of the time. These are the same issues from previous models that unfortunately have not been fixed yet. Overall the larger screen size and modern design make this phone a good decision."
1,"I absolutely loved it. It fits my phone so good. But the top was sort of hard to get on, but it's still good. I love the color of cover and it does get dirty easily so be careful! Lol. Loved it."
1,Everything was great
1,"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
1,"These are by no means a high quality speaker, but they do serve the purpose and as usual you get what you pay for."
1,great!
1,Good price
1,Charges a mini iPad well.
-1,Seems as though there are a lot of bogus reviews of this product. Every other person received this product free to review.........Beware!!!!!!
1,Case doesn't snap well. Pops off easily and have to restart phone.
1,Item works as expected.
1,Works great and easy to use.
1,You just can't beat Otter. The quality is amazing and if you want to protect your stuff for years then otter is the answer.
1,"First and foremost I received this case at a discount to give an unbiased review on. Upon first look the case is sleek and feels of a fairly good quality. It fits the phone very well and is very comfortable while being worn on the hip. Due to the size of the case it could be caught on something while being worn from the hip so be careful of that, not to say the case is overly large but it does house a large phone. The case feels firmly secured when closed unlike other cases I've used in the past. All in all it is a terrific case especially for the money. I am very pleased with it."
1,Rocking phone!
1,"I love this CD mount. It is perfect placement to take hands free calls or use the GPS for navigation. It is sturdy and supports my iphone 6 well.  I do have a case on my iphone and if the case was any bigger, like a big Otterbox, then it would not fit. That would be my only complaint is that it almost doesn't fit completely into the pocket of the device, but it stays in place considering. My CD player doesn't work so its just as well that this stays in it regularly. I would recommend it if you are looking for a mount for the car that is easily accessible and good quality."
1,Great sound
1,I would recommend it to everyone! Great quality. Delivered in time. Very nicely packaged product.
1,Love this Bluetooth headset!<br /><br />Have had the product for two months now. The sound quality is excellent.  The headset maintains a charge for three days with regular use.  No problems with connectivity with my iPhone 6.
1,Works great.  This product reduced the number of outlets my daughter needed to use in her college dorm.
1,"Stylish, lightweight with a nice lean to position for horizontal reading."
1,Fits as promised.... Does make difficulty when pressing buttons along or near the edge. But it is still a good screen protector.
-1,"Very prompt delivery, and item as described, but cannot charge it with some of the non-apple chargers. The opening at the bottom is not wide enough to insert the cable fully in. Very nice design."
-1,I've had a lot of problems with this phone and am not happy with it.  It won't save addresses correctly and I've sent products to wrong locations many times.
1,Awesome watch for the value. It's easily customizable and definitely serves its purpose!!
1,This is the most easiest screen protector ever to apply. No bubbles at all! Just place it in your clean phone and that's it! The clarity is so clear that you cant even tell its on. It hasn't scratched at all and is very durable. Great product and great price!
-1,This just does not have the muscle to adaquitly  hold my phone.
0,The Aux cable works but there is issues with ground noise from the engine that is audible. Not really a fault of the product and is a fairly easy fix with an isolator. The lightning connector does not play music for some reason. I can't figure out how to get it to play audio through it. I've tried two different iphones and they aren't showing up or sending audio. It will charge the phone though. Personally it's not an issue for me as I don't have an iphone but still would have been nice to have that feature for friends or family that want to use it.
1,"Slim, lightweight and very easy to grip. Perfect for lightweight and light duty protection."
1,Easy to apply and was what I expected
1,"Even though I have only had it for a couple hours, I am so obsessed with taking photos with it. There are literally no flaws! I love it, it stretches to probably like three feet!"
0,Not exactly what I wanted but it works ok.
1,"Loving my car charger, so necessary for my iPhone."
-1,Comes up as not compatible or not an approved adapter for this device. I am on IOS 8.4.2.
-1,"The charger works good with a 2 amp power adapter, but the suction cup design is useless in a car.<br />The phone slides off with any movement at all. You can't drive with a phone in place. (Galaxy S6)<br />I made a small aluminum tab and glued it on the bottom edge to hold the phone in place, but any bumps still cause it to fall off."
-1,"I love the case, HOWEVER, I purchased the teal case & when I take pictures with the flash my picture turn out greenish."
1,Beat phone I have owned to date
1,"I don't understand the negative reviews on this product. I bought this item and took it to a professional to install it for me. After installation, I left the store a happy camper. The GPS worked without any issues, the back up camera worked without any issues., the system worked without issues Everything worked as expected. This is the best stereo you can buy for the buck. I think that the issue is that people try to install it by themselves and end up not installing it right. Mine works excellently with no complaints at all. If you want your system to work well, take it to a professional that knows what he/she is doing. This is the best equipment I have ever bought and was 100% happy. When my radio or GPS is on and I put my car in reverse, the back up camera comes on and when I put my car in drive, the backup  camera goes off while my radio or my CD or my GPS is still on. I don't have to do anything to make it work. In summary, if you want your unit to work well, take it to a professional and I promise you will be glad you did."
1,This was a gift for a friend. She loves it and it was shipped in record time. Thanks...
-1,Doesn't charge fast at all
1,love the case. The colors are very cute just not as neon as in the pics but still very close. I got them today so if theres any bad reviews in the future I will just let everyone know! :)
1,Great product!! It's very convenient to have my phone and wallet in one place.
-1,"The original batteries were defective, and after miscommunication with the seller; I received adequate replacements...but then the charging station literally melted."
1,"Worked for a month before it fell apart.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I had originally voted this product one star, but shortly after I was contacted by anker and they offered me either a different unit or a refund. I chose the refund and the process couldn't be better. They emailed me at every step of the way and completely managed my expectations. I got a notification when- my request was received, when it was sent to amazon, when it was approved by amazon and I got notifications from amazon along the way as well. Got my refund within days. I would deal with this company again.<br />Side note- I have a portable battery from them and it works like a charm."
1,It is very nice to have the speed charger in my cat when my phone is dieing.
-1,"I haven't bought this, but it has all the features I was looking for- EXCEPT SOMEONE HAD TO PRINT NON-SENSE ON THE BACK. WTF is a &#34;Unicorn Beetle&#34; and why would I, a white, straight, American male, even think about walking around with such rubbish on the back of my phone. That alone is the deal-breaker. Please provide a quality product marketed to someone other than hipsters and 13-year-old girls. The case itself looks like some mil-spec hardware. What does that have to do with a Unicorn or a Beetle?!?"
0,They fall apart easily
1,excellent little battery for the s5. couldn't get any smaller and still provide the extra battery capacity that it offers. I ordered the black one and found that the matte black finish looks good and offers average grip. I would say that it has effectively doubled my battery life and love the fact you don't have to turn the unit on for it to work.
1,"Boyfriend loves it, I bought a more expensive one just in case and he chose this one."
-1,the cable didn't fit my iphone as promised.
1,Worked just as advertised
1,Hard to aim the screen protector with the tablets speaker/camera they don't seem to aline correctly.  But in all its not a bad screen protector works pretty good
1,"Overall it was a good purchase. only when i recieved it, the package was open, there was a tiny scrach on the screen under the screen protector, and surprisingly it was the middle east model!!! The package arrived with arabic writings on it. except for this, the mobile is running perfectly. fast processor, crisp screen, amazing camera. I love it."
1,"I always purchase Finite for all my devices, tablets and phones. Well made and lightweight."
1,Not to many BLU case uptions available. For the money this is a great case with useful stand. My grandson dropped my phone a few days ago and phone is still in good condition. I am happy with this case.
1,Fit perfectly
1,Good product... Thanks
1,Works like advertised. No issues using it with my Note 3
1,"Fit well, easily fit, seems to be all good. Won't know until it gets dropped!"
1,Great item!!
1,Cheap and good
1,Good
-1,0 stars but I had to add 1 for some reason. The first time I used this product the plug broke off into my phone. Can not return.
1,does the job I expected
1,Love it. So easy to install and it's still working great. Feel so much better to save a lot of money for DIY.<br />Good thing about this item is that everything came with it. Just installed and that's it.
1,"This charger is exactly what I needed. I have a dashcam, my phone, and my work tablet all plugged in at the same time. The different voltage ports ensure my tablet had enough power and my phone can use the 1.0 volt port. Plus the hardwired micro-usb charger is great when my wife needs to charge her phone"
1,Amazing
-1,not good at all and i don't recommended to buy it
1,I constantly drop my iPhone 6 but it's still in one piece. The belt clip is awesome
1,"Great price, fast shipping, very happy with purchase."
-1,"I bought two but cut off, very bad"
1,As described fits perfectly. Sunday deliver wasn't expecting that.
1,Great
1,Good case for the phone
1,"Got two, love the sound they can produce. On my 2000 V6 EX Accord, this pumped brand new life into the speakers that I never thought was possible. One of my units is much dimmer than the other, however. Wish there was a brightness setting to adjust on these. It's mostly visible, but I'd appreciate having the option to adjust."
1,"Mini size super battery. It is as small as a mini flashlight or close in size to a lipstick case but carries an 8 hour charge. And, it comes with the cables, you don't have purchase them seperately, what? I know! Plugged it in to my iphone 6 which was at 10% and in less than 30 seconds my phone was at 95%. Incredible price, super easy to use and does the job well."
1,Everything was as promised.  Thanks!
1,Very nice phone case. Great quality and durable without being too bulky.  The reason why I gave it 4/5 is because I have a huge problem with the buttons. Its really hard to take screenshots & control the volume. Really irritating. I honestly don't think I'll be buying another one for this reason.
1,love the case and it was perfect fit on my phone
-1,"The case does what it claimed...to a fault.  I was unable to be heard by callers due to the case, which made it unusable."
-1,I want to meet the engineer who designed this device..... Maybe he can explain me how to use without pain in my ears....too cheap to be good...
-1,I gave an extra star because the color is vibrant & looks amazing! But one drop on the (hardwood) floor & my screen cracked :-( what's the point of a case if it doesn't protect the screen? Disappointed.
1,Is very good it was a gift to my nice she love it ! Thanks
-1,I got a lots of bobbles.too bad
1,"Still haven't smashed my phone yet...., Kick stand is Great..."
-1,"Only work minimal with direct sunlight.  Better use the old ways, open and close the car doors not completely about 10 or 20 times, temperature inside the car will reduce faster than using this.  Good exercise for you arms too."
1,loved it
1,"Great for the Iphone 6. We are hard on phone really heard on them but these covers have done a great job well over a year and the phones are still like new,"
1,So I have had the phone for nearly a month now and I will try and make this short.<br /><br />- Battery lasts a long time and charges fast.<br />- Screen is clear and bright.<br />- Touch screen could use some improvement. It works but sometimes you have to press harder than normal to navigate due to sensitivity.<br />- The OS is a older format and isn't as refined or user friendly as newer versions.<br /><br />Overall this is a really good phone. Can't beat it for the price. Yes there are a few things I wish were better but you get a lot of bang for your buck with this phone. Its perfect for someone on a budget or need a everyday &#34;beater&#34; that just works day in and day out. If your wanting something fancy or into having the newest gadget then your better off paying five times as much for what will make you happy.
1,case fit perfectly with galaxy note 5 and it sparkles. Yeeeessss Hunty!.
-1,I followed the directions on the product's website and didn't have a problem putting on the shield.  The problem is a few days/week later.  Bubbles started appearing and then the edges start to come loose and you can't get them to stick again.  I've tried two different shields with similar results.
-1,Doesn't go on very easily and it leaves a lot of smudges that you can't clean off
1,Perfect
1,Wonderful :)
-1,very cheap. i threw it away
1,Works great on my iPhone 6!
1,"This is a great screen protector that is easy to transfer from packaging to phone screen. This protects my phone screen as if it is a 10 on the Moh's scale, but retains its sensitivity."
-1,"Case that fits the phone dosent fit properly and when slid into the holster, stretches the bottom and turns screen on."
1,Best case! Baby / toddler proof
1,"Accurate heart rate. Connected to my Galaxy S4 using the Wahoo fitness app. All my Garmin devices are connected this way. The S4 has Ant+ hardware in it already and is ready to go. Garmin cadence and speed sensors, garmin foot pod, and garmin heart rate monitor.<br />Very pleased with all the garmin products I purchased on amazon"
0,"its ok, the cutouts on the side seem to hinder being able to use the buttons easily."
1,Wow! Great product.  Fast shipping.  Can't ask for more : D
1,Easy to set up and very useful.
1,This is a very cool and handy device I even bought one for my mom as well I can't believe how small it is and has many ear plugs to choose from for a comfortable fit. oh I also bought one for my father so actually bought three total. a very cool item to have I highly recommend to get them!
1,Love this case really sturdy too
1,Works great and I love it!
0,"Nice case, fits great."
0,Didnt fit the phone I had
1,works great!
-1,poor quality
1,Love it
1,"I really don't like the  types of mounts that attach to places like air vents, cigarette lighters, cd player slots, or use suction cups. I do like the custom mounts that attach behind a trim panel and are pre-bent to fit - but they are pretty expensive. If you're willing to tinker a bit to find the best place, this is a great solution and you can't beat the price. I used this with a Bracketron device holder which attaches to this mount easily using the Bracketron t-notch plate. I was able to use this without needing to screw it in anywhere on the vehicle - once I re-attached the dashboard trim panel it was snugged up tight. The three bendable prongs at the mounting end are great to get a custom fit. Very impressed with the quality and design for under $7!"
-1,"Good idea but with an Otterbox case on the iPhone, I find it spend way too much time lining up the connector. Wanted a dock I could quickly drop the phone into but this is more work than simply using a regular lightning cable. Would not recommend."
-1,This is a horrible excuse for an android tablet.  Some slick (slimey) Verizon sales person sold this to my 85 year old father for $250 plus monthly data fees.  The tablet has 4G space but only 1G allowed for apps and the preloaded apps take 75% of that available space.  Even firmware upgrade can't fix the issue. So my parents are out over $500 for a piece of #@%& they can't return to Verizon.  Stay far away.
1,"I like that it has 2 USB ports - very handy since it seems there can never be enough ports.<br /><br />It was difficult to test the air filter part.  I do not smoke and was not about to to test the product.  Great that it does filter though.  As a hayfever sufferer, I always am looking for &#34;natural&#34; solutions and an air filter like this would be one.  Sometimes filters can be loud but this one is not at all - perhaps masked by the ambient noise of the car.<br /><br />I purchased this at a reduced price in return for an unbiased review."
-1,"I'm using it with the Nokia DT-910 charging stand, and it constantly disconnects and reconnects, with the iPhone vibrating twice each time, which is much more annoying that fiddling the iPhone into a normal charging stand, or a cable into the iPhone."
1,LOVE THIS CASE. I'm on my third or fourth one. They don't last that long but they are affordable and so nice because of the wallet.
-1,The anchor fell off on day two of having it and the plastic part that holds your actual phone snapped when I put the phone in the case for the first time! Waste!
1,Works great and thank you for fast shipping
1,Love it
-1,"The unit worked for the first 30 days or so; however, the device over heats very quickly and burnt out to expensive 64gig micro-SD cards.<br />The unit would freeze often and stops recording. The picture is great when the camera is actually working but it is unreliable and defective."
1,Love my phone case. It's just what I wanted.
1,I have always been a big fan of Kenwood products. I purchased this amp to replace the same style because of issues with the circuit board. When the amp arrived it wasn't the one I ordered it was the 2000watt version. I'm not complaining just wish they would have told me so I could have done some research on it. I haven't noticed the 200 watt difference. With the hot days we have had I have been putting it to the test seeing if it will cut out as it's not fan cooled. It's been doing great I recommend this amp so far I will update if I have any issues.
1,good product
1,Nice and large.  Makes it easy to hook on and off pots and pans.
1,Good case good price
-1,doesnt work with my lg g3
-1,Brushed metal part of case began pulling away from the rubber part of the case 2 days after it was put on my phone. Not worth the money.
1,"these work great.  took some trial and error to get the right loop and bud combination for my ears, but once I did they stayed in great.  the range is better than most other Bluetooth headsets I have used as well, and the sound quality is good.  The battery seems to last longer than needed, I usually use them a couple hours a day and charge them every 4 or 5 days &#34;just because.&#34;"
1,Works great!
1,Excellent
-1,Not compatible with iphone 5s
1,I purchased this mostly for camping but it's the best purchase I have made. I use it constantly. My new car doesn't charge if the engine is off. My cell a lot does something that uses energy and maybe fading fast. This weighs no more than a cell and charges on the fly. I used constantly  to keep my kindle charged while away from a power source. Yesterday I carried on a long hike because the phone had dropped to 52% for some reason. Love this thing!
0,"I have had my headphones for about six months now so I have had ample amount of time to give a clear review. While these are my first bluetooth headphones so I cannot compare them to others, I can say these do not stay on my head unless I am completely upright which can get really annoying.<br /><br />I bought these for two main reasons: it had good reviews and they were cheaper than beats headphones. Now I wish I had just spent the extra money. I'm not a sound expert so I won't give you five paragraphs on why the sound isn't great, I think it sounds fine, but the noise cancellation is awful! Everyone I walk by in the gym can hear exactly what I'm listening to so if I decide I want to jam out to some Rihanna or Beyonce, everyone is going to know. I read that in a couple reviews before I bought them and didn't think it would be that big of a deal but the longer I've had them the more it has bothered me."
1,"Sound and bass is awesome. Most comfortable headphones hands down. It's doesn't even feel like I have headphones on they not only fit around your ears perfectly but inside too,  they are slanted perfectly to fit inside your ear so the buds don't pop out like other headphones. They also look super nice. Best headphones I ever owned out of the hundreds I had."
1,"I'm new to the iPhone scene.  I bought this case due to many positive reviews.  Right now, it fits my needs. The iPhone 5s fits snuggly.  Only issue I discovered today, is that the typical cord that one plugs into the phone jack doesn't fit nicely.  You have to really push it in, versus earbud-like &#34;male&#34; ends.  I hooked it into my Bose system and the case made the &#34;plug-in&#34; difficult, yet it did happen.  I won't be doing this that often, I just wanted to see if I could. The most important thing to mention is that the case does not really enlarge the phones footprint.  I got the iPhone 5s because of it's smaller size.  This case doesn't make it more bulky and it actually allows the user to better grip the phone.  Thanks Amazon, Otterbox, and all those who took the time to write a review."
1,Great protection for my iPhone. Not too bulky either.
-1,Got these as a temporary replacement for my charger. They worked for what I needed. But then the daggum end of the cable broke off into my phone and I had to try to manage to get it out. Worth it? Yeah I guess. Will I get them again? Nah.
1,Fits and protects my  nine year old's grandson's Samsung Tab 4. He loves it.
1,It's perfect.
0,This thing was huge
1,"I love this! I had to buy another one! It clips perfectly on my belt, short, shirt, and waist fanny pack bag, most of all it clips to yoga pants with no pockets! Only thing The only thing is, you ha e to be careful that of your phone falls, or will break. The support for your phone is not secure.  Other than that, It clips to almost anything and it is great!"
1,"im writing this review because I know full well that this unit is by no means a 'luxury item'. It is not the crime de la crime of car DVD players. So that is my basis of comparison and why I've given it four stars.<br /><br />The bad: Formfactor is very cheap feeling and seems fragile. When you handle the unit, it creaks like a scary movie. Yes, the plastic literally creaks when you flex the unit. Also, if you are using this with kiddos, and you're the only other one in the car...navigating DVD menus is obviously difficult.<br /><br />The good: the unit plays DVDs very well and doesn't skip on bumpy roads. The volume coming out of it is sufficient to defeat road noise in a battle of wits...but we also plugged the player into the car's sound system, which worked well. The player is very easy to take in and out of the car as well.<br /><br />Overall...GREAT unit for the money. awesome value."
0,"It went well at the beginning, but after 2 months, the music sometimes sounds intermittent. I almost decided to buy a BackBeat Pro, but now I hesitate."
1,"I bought this for my wife who is using it for her Apple Watch and iPhone 6 Plus. She loves it. It really is a great idea and takes up little room on her desk, yet works well for what it was designed to do. My wife uses her stand every day."
-1,Worked b- for a bit..now the static is too bad to unDer stand anyone
-1,"I really was in need of a longer charger and this one seemed perfect. I absolutely love the length, for this price it seems like its worth it. But don't be fooled, the first couple days it was awesome and worked excellent. I started to notice that the lightning symbol in the top right hand corner was on meaning it was charging but the percentage was going down while i was using my phone. I figured i maybe needed to put it down for a little and use one of my older chargers, however it would work on and off. Sometimes it charged while i was on my phone and sometimes it didn't, it was working fine when my phone was off. Then it got bad, my phone was on a low percentage the night before maybe like 20%. I plugged my phone in thinking it was charging. The next morning, I woke up late because my alarm hadn't gone off and my phone was dead. My phone had not been dead the night before so this seems strange to me. That day i tested the charger out on someone elses phone thinking its maybe a problem with my phone but the phone i tested it on had a percentage of 71 and i played on the phone for a few minutes and checked and saw the percentage was at 69. I turned off the phone and left it alone and it was now at 68%. Im so confused as to why the percentage is going down, i can see why it would go down while I'm playing on it because perhaps its just not charging. It was so strange to me that when i turned it off the percentage still went down. Maybe its just the charger i got or maybe its the brand... i don't really know what to do because my older charger is being funny as well. Did this charger ruin my phone battery?"
1,"Nice band , great value."
1,Good fit looks great.
1,"Easy snap ones, kind of rubbery feel to it!"
1,It's good!!
1,"Im a clumsy adult whose constantly dropping and shattering screens but I've had this case for a little over a year and its still going strong. I've dropped it on just about any surface as possible, road, sidewalks,  tile, & even smashed it on my car door... love it & cute color too (:"
1,Better than wat I imagined
1,it's ok
-1,Worked for a week. Then phone would not except the cable
1,Excellent product. Very satisfied with the retractable cords. it's elegant and almost invisible. Sound is clear and microphone works great.
1,This is great for guitar players who use pedals. I am glad I bought this. Saves $$$$.<br /><br />Steve
0,"Okay, does not stay open."
-1,It never worked the red light came on but it never  charged the battery a piece of crap . Only gave a star because I had to.
-1,Item was too bulky.
1,WORKS GREAT LOVE IT!
-1,wrong cord
-1,Is easy to broke
-1,This case would be great if it had not broken within a couple of weeks. The case and holster both are broken. I am not rough on phones at all and this said it was the armor series case. The plastic is very thin and cheap. I would not recommend this case to anyone.
1,Awesome
1,Love it
1,Arrived fast. Good product
1,Daughter loves it.
1,Great product!! Looks great and is WAYYYYYY better then the stock radio I had in my 01 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Makes the sound so much better. Shipping was fast and over all glad I made the purchase!
1,I have several of these working in my home now. They all work flawlessly and [with IFTTT] have limitless possibilities for programming. Looking forward to adding more as time and $$$ permit.
1,I just love this iPhone case if I'm out and need to  fix my hair I con just look on the back and I'm done I Recommend you get this case thank you Amazon
1,"This is a great pair of headphones for any kind physical activity. Took it out on a long run today, stays perfectly in place and you do not have to fiddle with it every time the buds get sweaty. I like the piece that goes behind the ear. Its very subtle and lightweight so, you do not have anything bothering you.<br /><br />The cable has a plastic covering. Which protects it from the sweat. Currently, the cable is not very flexible, but I loosens up a bit.<br /><br />The sound quality is great for the money you pay! As i mentioned, great headphones for the outdoors. Must buy, if you like good quality headphones at an affordable price."
1,Love love love 5 stars for sure
1,Great product.
0,Not so good. Need to work on the edge part.
1,I brought this case for a co-worker she loves it!
1,"love it.  clear, easy to use and long talk time!"
1,Works well overall. I have used this item on a couble of rides for about a week. The only reservation I have is the red Web type rubber piece that holds the phone. Seems if it were to stretch or break the mount would no longer be<br />usable.<br /><br />This concern might not be warranted. Only time will tell.
-1,Did not like.
-1,"This item wasn't a reliable product. After two weeks of having it, under 2-3 uses, the outlet usb adapter died on me. It was left charging a galaxy tab and found died in the morning, while not even charging the device. Worst investment ever. I won't buy from Aukey again. smh."
-1,"piece of junk, doesn't want to hang right, the stickers they give you to put it up , don't stay and the brackets that the magnets are in are all chipped and broken , I sent mine back"
-1,I've had this product for about three months.  The battery drains almost completely after a short phone call of 5 minutes.  It takes about 8 hours to charge it about 20 percent.  There are glitches and things don't seem to work right. Such as touching the screen and it is frozen or takes me to different applications.  I'll be in the middle of something and the screen goes black and it will restart.  Several more issues as well.  I'm not happy with this product.  It's not really reliable and I feel that it's a lemon.  Once it's bought and paid for nothing you can do. There's a 30 day window of return but if there's no chance to use the phone during that time your out of luck.
0,"I really wanted to like this product. And I wish I had more patience to give it more chances because I sense that if I put in the time to really let it work for me that it could definitely improve my posture. However, the first couple tries, I simply don't want to keep trying.<br /><br />My first concern is that you have to calibrate it yourself. I probably should have expected this given that you get to choose where to wear it so it makes sense that to be effective you'd have to calibrate. But the thing is, that means you first have to set yourself in model posture to create a baseline. If I had more confidence that I knew what a healthy posture was to start with, I'd feel better about creating that baseline. But I worry that I am choosing something that is wrong, because it feels unnatural to me and then I am forcing myself back into it all day long and that will do the opposite of help my body.<br /><br />Even more importantly, while this might be a great product for someone who sits in one spot all day, or stands, like a teacher or other attendant, if you have a varied or active job, this thing goes off ALL THE TIME. It goes off every time you bend down to pick something up, lean over, reach for something, etc. So either you have to be distracted by it constantly, or tune it out, which then defeats the purpose.<br /><br />Under certain circumstances I can see this being a really helpful product, but in my situation I am not able to willing to commit to what it would take to make this helpful to me."
1,Great little radios. Work like a charm over short distances. Don't believe a half mile range though.
1,Great! Love the accessories it comes with
1,love my stylus pens.. great deal
-1,Didn't work.  Not Apple
-1,The product does not match the picture. I decided to buy this because from the picture it appeared to cover the entire screen with hole punches for home button and camera etc. It does not. It  is actually smaller than the screen protector I  replaced.  I paid more for this screen protector than the others on Amazon because the picture indicated full overlay. The fact is it  smaller than cheaper competitors.
1,Perfect color
1,Good
-1,Didn't like it
1,"Great buy!  This thing has a lot of juice!  Exactly what I needed and easy to use.  My only issue was if the device is not drawing power it shuts off--you can't force it to stay on.  Does not interfere with charging, but does for a device that use like a light or something.  Not enough of a drawback to lose a star!"
1,"Great, like it"
1,"happy to buy this one...more value than money. It holds my Garmin nuvi GPS and iphone (5S and 6) nicely without any issue. Also being on the dashboard means easy for visualization during driving. Other good thing is due to the weight, it stays nicely on top of the dashboard (even while driving on rough roads or on highways). I would recommend this."
1,Bought as a gift for my son-he loves it
1,"Amazing. Great price, easy to put on. Will always be buying these from this seller."
1,Perfect item. Buy it.
1,Perfect
1,"If you are debating, then just buy it. I have been using this for the past half year, it is so convenient to have this, and I hardly miss any messages with this sitting next to my ear."
1,Really nice case.. Very good quality loved it!
1,Great product
-1,it didn't work! :(
-1,I gave the size of my case. But the case still did not fit my phone.
1,"Simplifies family or work travel, plus have it by my favorite chair at home to top up all the family gadgets."
1,Great Job
-1,Wasn't the one I wanted
0,"Bought it as a replacement for my sanho purchased in 2009. However the slow transfer speeds but me off, I am not able to partition the drive which I could do earlier.."
-1,"Screen cracked within days of application. I contacted Sir Lancelot's Armor through Amazon four different times about the defective product and getting it replaced under warranty. They have completely ignored me and I guess I was ripped off. I thought they were legit, but obviously a lot of other people are upset with the poor performance of the product and agree Sir Lancelot Armor Company does not stand behind the advertised warranty."
-1,"I don't think it lives up to its hype. About one third of the calls are not clear enough to hear. I have to shut the ear piece off, or call back the person that called me."
1,Now I am a certified iTech.  I love this product
1,It's really prettier in person. .great quality
1,My husband loves it. No complains. Charges his cell.
1,Good
1,I can wear it in many different way's love it.
1,"Fantastic case, the hot pink is a beautiful color. Great customer service and received quickly ! Would definitely recommend to friends."
1,"Perfect fit for my iPhone 4S. BEST PRICE TOO. this is my 3rd one to order, one for me mom and kids!"
1,Great product! Easy to install too
0,"the screen touch works okay through the cover, but people have a hard time hearing you talk.  You end up taking your phone out everytime which is a hassle.  It does hold securely to your arm."
1,It works but I still have to carefully position the phone first.
1,Fit my iphone 5s with screen protector just fine. Lasts me my entire 14 hr day at work
1,FYI: I wear a size 10 and these are a bit loose.  Should be perfect when I add a gel insole.
1,Works as promised
1,"As expected, this selfie stick is pretty neat. I love it! Handy and sturdy. I love the colors. Will definitely recommend to my friends."
1,Great Product.  It's always protected phone well.  Only complaint would be with belt clip - it breaks easily.
-1,If I could get rid of the busy signal it would be OK. It has nothing to do with charging the unit. I have it plugged in to the wall. It's compleatly  unusable.
-1,Knock off.  Don't trust it to protect my phone
1,"Good price ,works good!"
1,Good case
-1,Wasted money
-1,"The phone is water proof, until parts of it start falling off and breaking. I have had this case less than 30 days and the flip out that covers my stylus broke the 2nd day that I had it. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Good stuff. Easy Bluetooth connect. Although it says to avoid using while charging weird.
1,So far so good. I have not checked the water proof quality but it will do for every day use.
1,Had it for a few months and is holding up well
-1,Purchased  this charger after I got my iPad mini in June.  In July I used it on a 10 hr. road trip and along the way my iPad quit as charger wasn't working.  Tried it again today and found that sometimes it works and sometime it doesn't.  Could it because I have a 2009 European car?
1,worked great.
1,I like it fine just is more peach than pink
1,"Works well. I actually purchased a second charging station because I wanted to be able to charge in multiple places. It's very cool, especially the secondary battery attachment that comes with it."
1,Good product
1,They are great
1,very good
1,"It works great, except for the phone mic system. Probably better to buy the model without the hands free calling."
-1,I really love my Fluance setup; sxhtb with bookshelf speakers but this subwoofer is not up to par. I am going to try a few more different RCA cables then a different receiver and maybe try just running it from the fronts but I just cant get it to sound all that great. The lows are barely there and if I turn it up it sounds muddy as hell. I have had a lot of subwoofers to compare and this is pretty disappointing ...If you are looking at this vs the polk psw10 go with polk. I like a little more punch to my bass and it just not here I am going to keep trying variations and will update accordingly but as a main sub I feel unsatisfied
1,"This is the best phone case. Despite not being bulky, it absorbs shock when I drop my phone (even on the hard sidewalk) and nothing has broken yet! It fits perfect but isn't too difficult to take off if you need to. It feels good and looks great on my white phone (although that being said, it does show dirt easily, but I just wipe it regularly). Highly recommended!"
-1,"This product is not Apple certified! It does not work with any of my devices.. iPhone 6, 5 and iPad Air 2"
1,"Battery runs down pretty quickly when connected to wifi, charge twice daily. Takes great pics and has great features otherwise."
1,Good product.  I have had many bluetooth before and this is one the best value.
1,Love the holligraphic lines. Feel like it could protect better since all edges arent protected but for the price it was well worth it! Used it a few wees now.
1,Good one.
1,Great product... Never have to use a wall outlet when traveling.
0,Antenna works alright better than the smaller one! Still could have a wider range of service. But it does save a life if needed.
1,Excellent quality. Classy look. I received compliments non-stop.
1,RIGHT BATT-THANKS!
0,This was alright but the tools included to open the iPod up broke and I needed to use a tiny screw driver. The batter fit perfectly and I haven't had an issue with it to date.
1,We have 2 polaroid 9&quot; tablets. We have bought a lot of silicones and they didn't fit...but these fit like a glove and everything lines up perfectly!
1,"I am a serious opponent of texting or even chatting on the phone while driving, just TOO DANGEROUS! But I do use my phone for Google Maps, and being an older version human, I don't entirely trust that ethereal voice coming from the phone. I want to actually see where I am going next, and that involves looking away from the road and down at the phone. I bought this nifty gadget to rectifiy that issue and I love it. Again, being that older version human, I need to have the dang thing a bit closer than the windshield in order to read it. The A/C vent option is the perfect position. This product clips on to the horizontal vent slats and has a collapsing stabilizing leg that allows it to fit onto a multitude of surfaces. The phone grasps are very easy to operate and have both side and bottom lips which are sturdy and secure the device well. The platform is adjustable and once you find the angle right for you, it is secured tightly in place with a simple twisting lock mechanism. I also like that the bottom lip has ample space to allow the charger to be in place. I like that insertion and removal of the device are extremely easy, which allows you to remove it and store it out of sight when not in use. I did read one question regarding the possibility of obstruction of airflow from the A/C, and I do not agree that it has no effect. I live in Florida and it is now August and this is of keen interest to me. However, while I did find it obstructed the airflow quite a bit, I resolved that by moving it to the farthest position of the two vents. That took care of it, at least for the driver side, and once the car cools off, I doubt it would matter much anyway. All in all, I think it was one of the best purchases I made recently on Amazon."
1,"This case is so cute! I love it.. only one small issue, the part that covers the power button was way too tight and it kept pushing in the button so i had to cut a small hole. Other than that, ots awesome! Fits like a glove"
1,"Very, very stylish looking case. This Vegan/Napa &#34;leather&#34; is really &#34;pleather&#34;/fake leather (vinyl)-- but looks VERY real.  It is the &#34;grippiest&#34; leather I have ever owned--VERY easy to hold onto the back! The sides are a tiny bit slippery though. Everything is well made and fits beautifully. The bezel has a decent &#34;lip&#34; to protect the screen. It provides about 'medium' (maybe hip level) drop protection--which is good considering how slim and refined it looks--it actually improves the look of the phone.  OH, the red is a darker red than the picture.  It is couple shades darker  (kinda 'brick red'.)  I paid $24.99 for it on sale.  I would have paid $35 for it. Not sure about $45.  But it looks really nice. **UPDATE To fix the slippery sides I put a 1/4&#34; strip of this gun/tool grip tape on each side.  It actually looks kinda like leather. amazon sells it: &#34;GT-5000 Grip Tape for guns, cell phones, cameras, knives, tools - makes anything &#34;Grippy&#34; 6 Strips&#34;"
-1,it leaves a ghosting edges all around the phone
1,I thought the tips would be thinner but I can Arial use them.
-1,"wanted a design without a closure, however the leather started wearing after 3 months.  In my opinion, overpriced for overall quality."
1,"I love this case. It's not bulky, yet if I ever drop my phone it absorbs the shock and nothing breaks! It looks great and feels great. The only downside is that you can see dirt easy (if you have a white phone). Highly recommend!"
-1,well i got this for my 2006 Nissan Altima i installed a boss radio and well it didn't fit i had to cut the top off and even the sides are to big it would hit the lip of the radio so i have to mess with it some more.....so its not installed yet
1,"Bought these for two way communication between fleet vehicles.<br /><br />The Radio:<br />Pros: Attractive and low profile design, sturdy housing, good ventilation, loud speaker, loaded with features, transmits on every frequency it receives (not limited to amateur band out of the box), good mic picks up audio at any angle and voice does not drop out if you get too far from your mouth (good for inexperienced operators).<br /><br />Cons: Only red, pink, and blue display colors available (no green), When attached to an MFJ power meter this radio only put out around 12 watts on high, 8 on med, and about 4 on low(Still makes great contacts and covers nearly 10 miles vehicle to vehicle on a full length 1/4 wave antenna) The programming software that comes with this radio installed and seemed to operate well on my windows 7 64 bit OS laptop but once I went to send my channels to the radio it said that the port was not opened. This was probably me doing something wrong but without any information included with the software and with very little outside information I was not able to resolve the problem. I ended up programing the radios through the menu which worked well but was a little tedious.<br /><br />Also worth noting:Decent/standard bracket, Power cord plug and fuses are standard/identical to a Kenwood, The instruction manual is obviously translated but the majority of the information is explained well. There are some places where you may need to &#34;fill in the blank&#34; so to speak.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this radio to anyone who is needing affordable communication. A very good and sturdy unit especially for the price!"
1,Excellent device!
1,Works great to keep all my devices charges
1,Great Price for 3 bands that fit good!
1,Got these for my daughter to use at school in the computer lab. The sound quality is perfectly balanced. They store easily in a small plastic bag. They are easily wiped down with an electronic wipe.
1,nice new item and fast shipping
0,"Went on easy and bubble free, however it doesn't cover the whole screen.. There's gaps between the edges and my phone case."
-1,Not to happy with this one.. item was returned.. wrong description.
-1,Not bad but not real rugged
1,Works just as well or better than the one that came with our life proof case (& we lost!) Great follow up customer service as well!<br />Recommend.
0,"It's not bad, I thought I was buying  A more secure silicone case. That was my fault. It is very stylish"
1,I love this case. The kick stand is great and like the slim profile.
-1,The ear piece receives ok but the other person cannot hear too well due to low volume. I would have to be almost yelling for people to hear me. I would not recommend this for any professionals.
1,Nice Simple cute phonecase
1,So it seems the issue with the lower reviews is some people are receiving products that aren't genuine.<br /><br />I received the right product. It works great. My only complaint is that the screen has a sort of blue tint over it seen on other reviews. I thought this was going to show up on the video file BUT IT DOESNT. the actual video clips are crystal clear.
0,okay product and worth the price
1,Great!
1,Works great!
1,Works as it should. Worth the money.
1,As described
1,Great product with great customer service
1,This is a good product. My only concern is that I won't be ale to use it when I need to turn on the heater in my car because I'm afraid that the hot air coming out of the vent will damage my phone.
1,Perfect! The lock feature comes in handy for different lengths as compared to others. iPhone camera with remote comes in handy. Bluetooth easily found and working in seconds. Other attachments for Hero / Camera also a plus. Fits iPhone 3's/4's/5's & 6's -Also 6Plus (Expandable iPhone insert)
1,Agree with previous reviews. Very nice and really like the versatility. If the material ends up stretching slightly it will be perfect!
1,Excellent results and product
1,Product slips out of car socket Replacement works very well/ changed rating to  4 stars
1,"I love this wallet case. I like the fact it is two pieces and I can detach my phone easily to take photos. Great feature. I also like the look and feel of the case, very professional appearance. Excellent overall!"
1,"The price was right, and the screen protectors installed with no more than the usual fuss and bother.  The Zune HD was in used condition so it wasn't quite perfect, but having the protector helps keep it from getting further scratches and hazing."
1,Works perfect! Arrived exactly as described with stylus pen. :)
1,"The best there is. alarm wise. It really does have great range, but up to a mile? i have yet to test that. But i can easily lock or unlock my car from a block or two away. The only cons i can think of, are 1.) the speaker is not as loud as i'd like it to be. and 2.) the remote start works great, but i noticed that it runs the starter faster than is needed to start my vehicle, after a while of usage i wouldn't be surprised if it burnt my starter out. Now i'm not 100% sure if the system is at fault for that, or the installer, but i definitely don't like that. other than these 2 issues. i highly recommend to buy this alarm, and buy a shock,tilt, and glass sensor to further secure your car."
0,"It's been a year since I had this. Ever since I got it, it's not staying in place. The rubber part of it I mean. Water gets in easily."
1,perfect condition<br />Thank You!
1,Excellent product! A+++++++++++
1,"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
1,This is ReStore SL4000 4000mAh Power Bank with Backup Solar Panel. I try to charge my LG phone with solar battery as much as possible.  I love solar battery chargers. I keep the charger on patio on weekends and let it charge fully. This charger is simple. One input for charging itself and one for charging devices. Simple and size of a smartphone. Works great in emergencies. If you are dedicated you could charge phones daily through this as well. A sample was sent for review purposes.
1,"Working like a charm for all networks in Saudi Arabia, excellent small and long battery life, Loved it"
0,"It lasted about a year and a half. It does the job, but my charging cable eventually split (idk how) and i couldn't charge the transmitter anymore. good thing you can use an android cable to also charge the device so that made it last a bit longer. eventually, the electrical issues inside just decided to break apart and now it doesn't charge. good thing it was $7. not bad, got what i paid for"
-1,I hate it
1,"So, just a short and simple review.  I have a lot of items from my previous MacBook, as well as just general day to day items that I still use that require being plugged in; this adapter lets you plug those items into the MacBook. (A little piece of me hates you Apple).  I’ve been using this item for the last week, I’ve been using it A LOT, it’s now a staple for me.  I actually plugged in a USB hub with this item, so my no peripheral (one) USB problem has now been solved. I highly recommend and maintains faster USB transfer speeds of 3.0."
1,Great buy
1,Sounds really good
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
1,"On time, no problems."
1,I was able to put this screen protector on myself. In the past I had the phone company put it on the new phone. This one was so easy and no bubbles. Just clean the phone with the solution and cloth in the package and line it up on the phone.
1,"The charger came on time, but I had ordered the wrong one. I needed the mini and went to the Verizon store to make sure I got the right one this time."
1,WORKING ON IT
1,"I bought this for a Nexus 6. I love the black bezels on this tempered glass screen protector, it makes the phone look as if there isn't a screen protector on. Installation was easy, but you have to be careful not to cover the front camera lens."
1,"This is a little more expensive than other tempered glass screens, but I think it's worth the extra couple dollars. I dropped this from around head height screen side onto a giant ass rock. There was a tiny tiny crack at the impact site. Dropping a phone onto a single point on a hard rock is probably some of the hardest force your phone can experience, assuming you're not throwing it at s***, and this screen protector took it like a champ. I would recommend this 100%."
1,Works good.
1,"Excellent item and service,we are in need of sellers with the same conduct of business as Falcon itech TM.<br />Keep it real, bless!"
0,"This case appears well made but I won't be using it anytime soon.  I'm writing this review just to say that my Galaxy S5 will not fit with the protective case (Galaxy S5 Case, Verus® [Thor]) I have on it.  Without the protective case I have no doubt that the bare phone would fit nicely but the Verus helps me hang onto an otherwise slippery phone so I'm keeping it and continuing to use other phone holsters."
1,meets my needs
1,Adhered to the screen all by itself. No rubbing necessary. Amazing!
1,"Gift for my Daughter, she was very pleased with the performance, of these headphones, and she is very picky."
1,Great sound and good Bluetooth connection skips a bit but not bad battery last about 6-7 hours. Good buy
1,I highly recommend this.
1,I have this stuck to my vans console and it is nearly vertical. My phone sticks to it with no problem.
1,Prefect
1,it is what I expected
-1,It fades quickly
-1,"Kid had it for 7 days, dropped it from a height of about 2 feet and now the screen is dark. Tablet's Wi-Fi strength is pretty weak too."
1,Love it.
1,Is very good quality  lovely :) i loved
-1,"[[VIDEOID:8f2c0fde0be1db3383e7e976147064ad]]**4/16/16 IMPORTANT UPDATE TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW**<br />After owning the LG G4 H815 for 10 months and absolutely loving it, I am sorry to say my phone died suddenly.  A few weeks ago out of the blue it shut down, and when I tried to turn it back on it starts to reboot, then dies, then starts to reboot, then dies, etc.  Some research online confirms this is a common problem with the LG G4 (called a &quot;bootloop&quot; problem), so common that the company has publicly acknowledged that it is a problem with the phone's motherboard and loose connections between some of its components.  There is nothing the user can do to fix it.  It must be repaired by LG.  They will repair phones under warranty under certain conditions, but NOT for the H815 model if you purchased it in the US.  This H815 phone is an international model that has no warranty when sold in the US.  LG has refused to repair my phone and I am stuck with a $500 loss after 10 months.  I would absolutely advise against purchasing this phone if you live in the US.  If you live outside the US, I would contact LG to see if you will have any warranty coverage before purchasing.  It is a real shame - such a great phone, but with a fatal manufacturing issue that renders many of the phones dead within 6-12 months.  Please search this problem on the internet and consider carefully before buying an LG G4.<br />*************************************<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />The LG G4 is an incredible phone.  It gets so many things right - big but not too big size, expandable storage, replaceable battery, tremendous camera, high quality, thoughtful user interface - and very few things wrong.  My video won't hit everything, but here are some highlights.  Feel free to post any questions in the comments section, I'll answer to the best of my ability.  Great phone!"
1,The item in question is working just fine<br />Nothing more to be said
-1,cheap junk
1,Love love love love this case. I truly think this is the best case ever. Highly recommend
-1,It would not line up to snap together - very cheaply made.
-1,okay
1,Wonderful product. Fits perfectly. Timely delivery
1,Was delivered when promised. Great product
1,Really Nice
1,Love it
0,"Check the kit carefully: you'll need the string (mine didn't have it but I pulled a strand out of a bike cable off-cut), the glass itself, and the roll of thin double-sided sticky tape. The rest of the kit is waste. Read the instructions, watch the video, notice how the glass in the video neatly comes off in one piece with the phone just laying there. That's not gonna happen to you. If your screen is cracked the glass will come off in pieces and the edges will try to cut the string.You'll need 4 hands: one to hold the heat gun and heat the glass where the string is, one to hold down the phone, and two to pull the string. Once you get the old glass off, you're fine, but getting it off is nowhere near as easy as their video. It remains to be seen how long the sticky tape holds."
-1,These only last a few months and then fray at the lightning connection end and stop working.   Seller offered to replace but never did.
1,a tool in the set did take off the back screw down on my watch but I have not used many of the tools from the set. they lok funtional though. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the next time i use a tool.
1,Perfect
1,"I LOVE Van Gogh's Starry Night, and I love having such a beautiful piece of art within grabbing reach whenever I want to look at it. Thank you for putting this painting on a cell case."
1,I didn't have any problems the case fit my phone perfectly. Shipping didn't take long at all. It does a great job protecting my phone. I recommend this product.
1,this is an extremely cheap case and its better than any case ive ever had before. because the inside of the case is mostly air pockets when you drop it one any corner of on its back it literally just bounces of the ground without damaging the phone.
1,"These screen protectors go on easy with no bubbles and are clear.  Some smudges but what do you expect, it's glass!!!"
1,For the price it is perfect
-1,"Came apart at the seams just over a month of use.  Basically, as other reviewers here have noted, it has a tendency to overheat, plus the head separates from the rest of the cord exposing the wires inside.  Although past the return date, it is still covered by warranty.  A quick online chat with customer service and I recieved a refund.  No need to return the defective item, as it is listed as discontinued.  A newer version of it is available, but a quick scan of the reviews shows the same design flaws.  I'll take a pass on it, thanks.<br />Seems strange that Amazon would put its name on such a shoddy product."
1,Works well for long trip but a bit heavy
1,GOOD
1,just as ordered but they forgot the ties ? but still its a great case to keep all those travel cable well organized
1,this is an awesome idea and product - perfect placement
1,"With all the USB devices, this makes a great addition to my technology accessories.  I can take this anywhere and charge my phone and my tablet together."
1,
1,My teenage daughter loves this!  Great value!
1,Very good. good seller.
1,Excellent
1,"Best one,  put on dash smooth area grips nice and easy release easy tabs, easy to place so it grips.<br />You will have to put in upside down and turn unit if you want to charge it holder covers plug in for S5 phone."
1,Price - great.  Ease of installation  - great.  Fit and performance - Great!  I'm not paying $50 for a high end brand name again.  This works just as well and if it gets scuffed or old looking it's cheap enough to just buy another.  Much easier than those not-really-a-warranty warranties the other manufactures profess to have.
-1,It is a good screen protector but in a week it cracked a little from the corners and the second time I dropped my phone it created a line in the middle.
1,worked well for the price and the amount of times I used it
1,"Looks nice, easy to put on and seems sturdy and protective."
1,"Very lovely and fits perfectly. I wanted something that gave me a little extra grip without adding too much to the size and this fits the bill. Only downside is that the design is very rough in texture. I thought it would be under a layer of silicone so the whole thing would be rubbery, but the design is painted over the silicone. The paint, however, is not chipping or wearing off. I've gotten used to it."
1,A good film for Moto X.
1,"I have had the Q-card case for the iPhone 6 for six months and it is the BEST phone case I have ever had.  I am a woman and a professional.  I wanted a phone case that would have my essential items when I slipped it into an evening purse or my pocket. I keep two credit cards, my driver's license and my health insurance card. I do not keep cash in it - doing so would stretch it so that I would always have to have that thickness of contents. When a card is removed for use it is important to hold the phone/case so that the other items will not fall out.  The material/leather stretches only according to what you put in it so if you wanted to carry just two cards it would probably be okay but only if you never put more in it.  When I need something like an Atm card with me, it does not go in the phone's case it rides separately. This is not a problem at all.  And guys, yes, it will still fit in most front pockets unless you are wearing trendy jeans, flat fronted trousers, or painted on pants, none of which have real pockets.  If you want your screen protected, get a good screen protector as well. I have dropped my phone in this case and my phone is fine but I did chip the edge of my screen protector so do use one."
0,Case looks great definitely water proof!  I am not a big fan of the front flip gets in the way for the most part.  Does not stay open so you have to constantly hold it open.  Would have given a higher rating but the flap gets quite annoying.
1,"Clever product, uses stiction and air pressure to attach the glass plate. My only quibble is with the instructions - if you only use one of the hinges to secure the plate for flipping back onto the phone face you will almost assuredly have a misaligned protector (as I do). This is only a cosmetic issue, but it's irritating. Use of two of the hinges supplied with the protector will produce a much better result."
1,Great for 6+..  Bought for song for his phone and he works outside a lot.
1,Very cute
1,Easy to install and great detail!
-1,"Very poor quality.  Case fits, but is not snug on my iPhone 5c.  Color and design is wearing/scratching off after just 2 days of use.  I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"very sturdy case, arrived ahead of schedule"
-1,Horrible. Dislike the product.
1,Works perfectly on a wide range of antennas. Always get a good 1.5 SWR or lower.
-1,The case was printed and looked nothing like the Tory burch logo. It was blurry and rough and I was very unsatisfied!
1,This has worked well for over a month charging one device or two at the same time.
1,"I had high expectations for this power bank, considering the price, and so far it's lived up to those expectations 100%. It's every bit as sturdy and tough as the description makes it out to be -- and yes, I've tested its waterproof-ness. I've charged an iPhone 6 twice and an iPad Air 2 once so far and it still shows half charge -- awesome! I'm thinking I'll be able to charge the iPhone at least 4 more times before actually having to charge this power bank.<br /><br />As for size -- it's definitely on the hefty side (length, width, and weight). But, you're not buying this to slide in your pocket -- you're buying it to keep you going in the great outdoors where anything is possible.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is one that rings true for almost all these power banks -- only one port is 2.1A for fast charging and the other is 1.5A, which is fairly slow for the larger capacity batteries on the new Galaxy phones, Sony phones, and any tablet. Other than that, which isn't a huge deal, I have zero complaints. I'm giving it 5 stars and would recommend it for preppers, hikers, backpackers, campers, and anybody else who loves to spend life outside.<br /><br />** I received this for a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This is my unbiased review. If I thought it was junk, I'd be using this space to tell you to avoid it. **"
-1,screen had damage
1,"Awesome phone. Touch works fine even with the hard glass protectant, fits perfectly, it's smaller than the otter box (more like a life proof) but heavier and much sturdier. The small piece that clips in to protect the charger port and headphone plug in may pop out a bit but it's because it's a tight fit and needs to be worked in a bit. All the buttons and controls work flawlessly, but the power button does require more pressure to depress, probably to make sure it's not accidentally turned off in your pocket since all others are effortless. I have had otter box, lifeproof, and a million others with my iPhone's and this is the sturdiest by far."
1,Great case offering that offers excellent drop protection.  Fits perfect and is very easy to put on and take off.
0,It works ok. Not able to charge my iPad and iPhone 5c together.
1,"Great price for a great product.  It arrived sooner than expected, and I am very satisfied."
1,Love this case. Easy to clean. Withstands many falls to the floor.<br />The flip-open option is neat but also needed to use with my accessories.
1,Just what I wanted when I Needed it
1,"Perfect fit, looks amazing. Doesn't pull the hair as per other reviews and as I had thought it would, May be because I have adjusted the band size for a proper fit and not loose. Easy to remove the pins for size adjustment."
1,This puppy has some heft to it. It is solid and easy to find in you bag. We all have lost power in the worst of places. This solves that.
1,Still working great
1,Nice comfortable and stylish watch wish it had a few more function's  but for the price you cant beat this watch
1,The best screen savers for my Samsung S II Phone for the price and that I have been able to find yet! 😀
-1,didn't receive any of the lens. i'm disappointed i wasted money on this. definitely recommend you don't buy this product
0,"I love the design and it is certainly good protection for my iPad, but it is a bit heavy to carry on a daily basis."
1,Finally a product that works! After trying several other manufacturers I came across Touch Charge and my charging problems with my iPhone 6 Plus have been eliminated thanks to this device. Excellent job Touch Charge keep up the good work !A charger that finally works!  Be sure to buy the case with your phone that works in conjunction with the charger it's a perfect combo.
1,"the design and colors for this case is so pretty. However, I was a little disappointed when I received the case and noticed it didn't have a front magnetic clasp to keep the case shut. Overlooked this when looking at the images before purchasing. If you don't mind the case not having a flap to keep it closed then this will be fine for you. I ended up purchasing another case with a flap to keep it closed."
1,good
-1,"Unlike every other stand wth this design, this is a cheaply injection molded plastic, not aluminum.  Don't be fooled!"
1,Feels comfortable in my hand which is always a plus
1,I've had this case for about three days now and it's great. Does what a case is suppose to do without adding bulk or hiding the iPhones sleek look. Logo is on the side so it won't show up on the back like most cases. Fits snug and has good grip when holding so you know it won't slide out of your hand
-1,I never leave product reviews but this has to be the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon. The case has broken at ALL 4 corners. I have had multiple iphones and multiple cases from different producers without any issues. I would never consider another flexion product again.
1,Excellent product!!
1,"I received the headset as promised.  They were easy to charge, program, and comfortable to wear.  So far, I am happy with the purchase.  I would say that this is a &#34;good buy&#34;."
0,Works ok doesn't charge as fast as I would like for a 2.0amp charger.
1,Good price for product.
1,Awesome
1,"I received my Asus as promised, when I turned on the phone for the first time, TALKBACK -ACCESSIBILITY was annoying as HELL. This accebility should be disable before shipping.  Battery life not so great for the price i can't complaint.  Still testing...."
1,Great fit. Best case for g stylo on the market:) if you use your phone very often ( for work) this is the right case for you;) it doesn't make your phone bulky and it fits perfect
1,"Very happy with this purchase. Unlike others, this charger works and doesn't prompt a warning message from Apple on my phone."
1,"Great product, but terrible shipping methods.  It took 10 days to receive the case, all because I wouldn't buy into Amazon's prime program.  Disappointed with Amazon's tactics of making you wait unless you buy-in oppressive shipping rates or their high priced Prime deal.<br /><br />FWIW the case fits perfectly on my Xperia Z3v."
1,Very high configuration for the price. Nice to have this phone
1,Case is great. However the plastic protective shield to cover the screen (Clear plastic) I mared up from a sticker attached to it. Looks bad & unclear in that area (top Portion). Can that be replaced? Both phones the same way.
1,Good deal...fast charge works great.  Beats the hell out of cord charging.
-1,"A bit disappointed with Lifeproof. I purchased my first case several months ago, and it was perfect. Accidently dropped it in my hottub, and it was fine. No water inside. It went through a couple drops, no problem. Then I go to the use the headphone jack, and it ripped off. Purchased my second case and it failed the waterproof test immediately. My second case has survived several drops, except for the silent button which ripped off. On my third case, and it's fine(except for the waterproof test). I'm about to purchase my 4th case. I hope it's truly &#34;Lifeproof&#34;this time. Otherwise! I 'll take a refund."
1,"This is pretty good if you just need a bit of juice, but alot of style. This is the best looking battery case out there, but not the biggest battery to charge your phone. It does not fully protect the phone. It leaves the sides and top exposed. I would recommend this for people who just needs that little extra charge without compromising design. I would suggest either Mophie or UNUcase for more battery and better protection."
1,excelente producto!!
1,So cool
1,Its cool
1,Nice and slim.
1,Awesome product. Even better customer service.  Bottom line... I broke the suction portion of the product.  They offered a replacement product even though it was my fault it broke.  They even did overnight delivery.  wow! Can't get any better support than that.
1,worked as promissed
1,Excellent. Fast charges Note 4
1,Great for geocaching via bike. Love this style. It'S secured and easy to see the screen still.
1,I have usd this cover until it broke. I have told many of my friends about the best place to find a case for your phone.
1,"Very strong, sturdy and protective! It has the phone completely sealed from any dirt and debris from getting in!"
1,I researched a ipod holder for my car for a while before deciding on this one.  It's been a good choice.  I've had it for about a year.  It is pretty adaptable so you can position both the arm and the apparatus at whatever angle you want.  It isn't super heavy so it stays in place well.  I would recommend this product.  UPDATE: One drawback - there is a styrofoam-like substance glued to the edges of this (softening the area where the ipod slides in).  After a hot summer I noticed it was peeling away from the plastic.  I had to glue it back on.  More ofa nuissance than a major drawback tho.
-1,"it was advertised as being for an I phone 5c, not true"
1,"It came on time just as promised. It is a great protector for my phone. My one gripe is also the best feature. I am glad that the phone grips the case, but that also makes it difficult to get the phone out quickly. With the phone gripping the case so tightly you know it won't fall out. With the stands to prop it up on flat surfaces that just makes this the best product for the HTC Desire 526."
1,Very fast charging.  Very well made.  i bought two for a trip half way around the word.  Worked better than advertised.  Materials are outstanding.
-1,What sicko would buy this?
1,ok.
1,Worked as advertised. Nice to have a choice of wind-shield or air vent.
1,"Easy to install, HD clarity.came with alcohol swab and microfiber cleaning cloth to clean the screen prior to apply the screen protector. This is good one to use for cell phone. I like this and recommend as well."
0,Transmit audio sounds like you are talking through a sock! Taking the mic apart and opening up the hole the sound travels through helps. Better than that is to replace the condenser element with the one Radio Shack still sells. The sad part is that the cost of the replacement condenser is 3/4 the price of the speaker mic!
1,"Awesome speaker, I love it....Sounds clear and loud enough....Perfect personal space speaker."
0,The name and picture on this posting did me in...(one buy click my ass)
1,"This is a great product! We bought this to go on vacation to Florida and it was one of the best purchases we made. It rained constantly in Florida and or course there was the beach. We got plenty of use out of this. The only thing I didn't like was how big and bulky it was, but it's definitely not a deal breaker. Great product!"
1,thank wonderful product
1,It's best cable ever I bought. You will never disappoint from it. I will buy it whenever I need.
1,Work great!!
1,Very fast for galaxy S5. CAUTION: i suggest charge your phone to 60% then let it cooled down for little bit. Because it might EXPLODE. Take care of your stuff. Bye haha
-1,"when you pull it out, it pulls the charging plate exposing the inside of the phone and wiring."
1,Sweet charger barely bigger than iPad charger but with 5 ports. Very well made
1,WORKED AS PROMISED AND DIDN'T NEED TO BUY A NEW PHONE OR PAY TOO MUCH FOR THE BATTERY
1,"A little nicer than pictured , no square hole in the back"
-1,"Love the length, the durability is poor. Unless you treat your charger as an infant then go somewhere else."
-1,"The battery flap doesn't stay down, it covers part of the front camera. I honestly want to get a different brand."
-1,The power strip is defective and doesn't work. I have emailed the company twice... waiting for a response.
-1,Lightning cable only works in one direction and the lightning tip broke off after 1 week of use. The retractable portion is also much larger than others I have. Would not recommend.
1,This is a great case with a kick stand. And alot cheaper then at the phone stores or the mall.
1,My daughter love it!
1,Does everything it is s supposed to.  No issues.
1,Excellent all-around product with great pricing and shipping time frame actions.
1,Love it!
1,I love my Up Move.<br />I decided to purchase this after receiving a little push from my best friend who purchased a different Jawbone product.<br />I was initially sold on buying another well known brand however after reviewing the differences in features I went along with her and purchased this Jawbone.<br />There are several things that I love about this little gadget.<br />First the size. Its super small and works great being clipped onto your clothing.<br />Im a nursing mom so I initially would clip it to my bra however that became more of a chore so I decided to use the wristband which I plan to review also. I love the option of being able to use it either way however the Jawbone bands design is horrible.<br />So back to this little gadget.<br />I also love the fact that it is wireless. That was a plus for me. My friend has a different model jawbone that has to be plugged into her phone however mine connects via bluetooth and that takes the work out of having to remember to upload data each day.<br />I also love that I receive daily reports regarding my activity and I'm able to track what i'm doing constantly and also compare it to what my friend is doing. We use that for a little weekly friendly competition.<br />Overall I've been very happy with my Up Move.<br />My only complaint is the battery life which seems to be pretty short.<br />I wish the batter lasted just a tad bit longer<br />My other complaint is regarding the strap that is made for the up move  ( purchased separately)<br />The strap does not stay on. The design is one big flaw and causes the band to constantly come off.<br />Other than that this is a great gadget to help you to stay on top of getting those steps in daily!!
1,"It arrived on time, and everything was just as described. Great price for a great product. VERY happy with this purchase.<br />Thanks so much! (:"
0,nod bad for the price
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
1,Works as expected.  Have apple and non apple products so it's great.
1,"Very good, work as well as the more expensive bluetooth headset. I am very pleased"
1,great case just don't care for the screen protector. its not easy to put on and u have to make sure to get it flat on or there are bubbles in between.
-1,"I typically buy only tech armor products when it comes to screen protectors for my electric devices, but I am very disappointed with this one it does not fit the phone it only covers the screen not the entire front of the phone like it should. Also it is just about a millimeter off from the screen so it doesn't completely even cover that! I will definitely not be purchasing more from them!"
1,Outstanding product and service
1,Love the compact design and the fact you can store a battery inside between use.
1,Excellent
1,great buy super fast shipping a+++
-1,"It arrived in a nice timely manner and is in good shape but the Wall charger didn't work, and the battery must be the original. The battery lasts half a day with little use. The product is refurbished so everything should work as new, just with some scratches right? The battery is the most important part of the phone. By the time I get a new charger and battery I should have just paid the extra $50 and got a new phone."
1,The best
-1,So i bought this thinking it was gonna be great! Well... It wasn't!! It lasted a week and the part that goes into the ipad broke!!
1,"Brand new, without any scratch or whatever. Sincerely, much more that what I expected. Thank you"
1,These just came in the mail and due to my other one not doing a very good job at charging my phone I plugged one in immediately. And wow not only does it work it appears to be very sturdy and is charging my phone super fast! It's a little shorter than the other one but oh well I'll take it!
1,I made my own gps mount  adapter worked grate  glenn
1,Love it! My favorite case
1,Pretty well made and my daughter loves it!
1,These things are great.  Perfect for road trips as I travel a lot.  I can see my phone at night using my alarm app.
1,"The only criteria that this product met was that it's full coverage, all of the other claims are wrong. 1. It's not scratch proof, I have not even had it for one day and it has scratches already. 2. It has bubbles all over the screen, and I followed all the instructions. thank you stealing my money EDIT: So as I wrote up here I had problems with my screen protector, but the costumer support contacted me saying that It was most likely product with factory flaws, so they sent me a replacement, and they were right, the replacement they sent is flawless, I loved it (: it fits perfectly."
1,Easy to break. Cute. Nice add to phone
1,Excellent product!!
1,"Great case looks and feels and fits PERFECTLY, if u need a case this is the one looks like I paid $100 ,it looks that good"
0,"Case is fine, but was promised it by Wed the 12th and didn't get for 2 weeks"
-1,"I just received my screen protector today and was eager to try this thick tempered glass for my newly bought LG G3. Installation is easy but my problem is it doesn't fit my entire screen. I'm disappointed, I had high hopes for this screen protector but I'm missing 8 mm for the bottom."
1,Great price. Makes a neat holder for the Apple Watch while charging.
1,"This gadget is awesome! Didn't notice when I purchased it, but hell... Had myself a phone call in the shower! All around pretty awesome!"
1,love this! works great
1,best holder I have ever owned.
1,Received them quickly and they work great with both my iphone6 and iPad Air 2 well worth the price
1,This is beyond a great case for your iPhone protection. I got my iPhone less than a month. I left the phone on the roof of my car and drove away at about 55 mph. My phone flew off and landed on the side of the road and this case did an amazing job protecting my phone. There are only scratches around the case corners and nothing happened to my phone. Thank you Spigen.
1,Perfect
0,"The ear pieces are comfortable & easy to sync, but the battery life!!! Only a few hours and the little voice in my ears starts telling me the battery is low. And once that starts it is only a few minutes before it turns off"
1,Nice flip case for Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 Fits perfectly the phone is really protected with this case on with the S View Window makes looking at time and quick messages with a breeze every port is easily accessible
1,My husband really likes it. It seems to work well with his iPhone 6 plus except for the texting features I knew were likely not available
-1,I thought it was a great purchase it look and felt nice with the soft leather. .. BUT within a week it started to peel off. Not worth it!!!
1,I love this unit.  So far I have tried every feature (except directly connecting my phone - though I've paired it with BT) and they work flawlessly.  Only weird thing is there is a slight delay from when you tap the screen and when the function actually happens.  Same thing also occurs when you first turn it on.  Mine did not come with a manual but you can download it here http://www.jensenmobile.com/mobile-multimedia/?sku=VX4022.  Cheers
-1,"Never did what it was supposed to do, I wouldn't recommend to no one😠😣😔"
1,"Product is very slim, which is what I wanted. It doesn't add much to the original size of the phone.  Won't protect the screen much though if damaged."
1,"These are awesome!  They are beautiful, well made and my daughter absolutely loves them. They sync with multiple devices, the battery lasts long and the volume controls are great.  I wish they made them for adults... I would totally purchase a pair."
-1,All 3 cables stopped working after 3 weeks of me ordering them.  All I get is error messages and I have tried to contact the seller.  However I have gotten no where.  I will not be buying again nor do I recommend these products to anyone.
1,My favorite case. I really like the stand so I can watch all my shoes.
1,Great and durable case. Super cute on my silver/white iPhone 6+ to boot. 😊
1,love it
-1,"Worked well for the first few months.  Eventually failed.  Has lifetime warranty, but there is nobody to to talk to to replace it."
1,Great quality and protection for the price
-1,"This was an awful purchase...the first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the pink x's on the water strip...the battery has water damage! I thought, oh well...maybe it will work long enough for me to charge my phone and transfer everything off of it, but it didn't work any better than my doorstop would have plugged up in my phone."
1,Solid very nice. Negative is it still doesn't make me feel safe about dropping the fun
1,Great replacement for the cracked lens on my Sprint Note 4. Pretty easy to install with the help of YouTube.  My phone focuses much better now and takes great pictures again. Haven't had a problem with it scratching easily. It's a well made product!
1,"Love it!  I already had one in brown and wanted one in blue.  I have had several compliments.  Fast service, too!  Will definitely order again."
1,Worked as advertised
1,Love it! Good quality and same As advertised! Happy with the product and it arrived right on time as estimated
1,"Works great without adding bulk to original thickness like the qi charging battery cover does, thus giving you more options when it comes to buying cases.  Works great and Chris quickly"
-1,"This buds are great if you don't move around. I talk on the phone with them and when I put my phone in my pocket, the line gets full of static. It doesn't matter what shorts I wear or if I'm inside or outside. If you just want to listen to music they do the job."
1,They work great.
1,very useful
1,Very happy!
1,Love It.
0,MAY BE OK.
1,All good
1,My new case is exactly what I had expected! I'm very pleased! It arrived quickly and was packaged very well!
1,Love it and keeping it.
1,"very good screen protector, very easy to clean."
1,"Works great, I bolted it to my hat for hunting. I sanded the ball for a smoother action. The 1/4-20 threads on my mount were fine (unlike another reviewers)"
-1,Its waterproof but that makes it hard to hear
1,"Decent product, especially considering the price.  Membrane doesn't fit tight over the edges, but brace does hold everything in place.if not for that, would have given 5 stars."
1,"This 4 foot long cable works perfectly with our daughter's iPhone 5c and our son's iPhone 6 (4.7).<br /><br />It was delivered right on time and in perfect condition. Nice fit on both, and it feel substantially built especially in comparison to the thinner plastic cables we have had. Even works just fine with the cases both have on their phones.<br /><br />If you are looking for a high quality, Apple certified, 4 foot long lightning cable for your Apple equipment, based on our kids' experience with this one we highly recommend trying this Letouch product.<br /><br />Excellent trouble-free cable so far.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from a seller, without obligation, and have decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing review reflect that testing experience."
1,Used for my Garmin Fish Finder.  Holds a charge for up to a year.  (that is with out using the Fish Finder)
1,"Easy to apply, goes on flawlessly! Very happy with purchase."
1,"This portable battery pack is perfect for traveling. I use it to charge my galaxy note phone and galaxy tablet, and I have found that I could get 5-6 full charges on my phone.The 2.1A charging port allows for a very quick charge, and the extra 1.5A USB port is a huge plus. The only downside to this device is that I have found that it takes 8-12 hours to fully charge. This is not really a problem though as I just charge it the night before its intended use. I purchased this product a little over 6 months ago and it still functions just as well as the day I bought it. I would absolutely purchase this product again in the future."
-1,Suppose to be better but still does not hold a charge very long.
-1,"Too difficult to sync. I had to return mine, Which is something rare for me."
1,"The product works really well, as long as I kept it plugged in to charge. Unplugged, there was a lot of interference. Still, that's a small problem and overall I am very happy with it. Sadly, it started acting up after about a month of use. However, the customer service completely made up for it, replacing the product without complaint. I'm extremely satisfied and would definitely buy products from them again."
1,Very good.Works in my S5.
-1,"expectations was too high, and was let down"
-1,"Not worth the price.  It works,  but its just not worth the price"
1,For the price these are fantastic wireless earbuds. I've listened to about 30 hours of audio books with them. I'm very satisfied.
-1,"GARBAGE, Absolute garbage!  Charging a premium price for a piece of junk like this is shameful. Tip completely separated from cable after second use.  I have no reason to believe this is a counterfeit, it's Belkin making a junk product.  A counterfeit might actually work better."
1,I love this case- the design and the coverage of the phone.
1,Great quality
-1,"Do not buy if you have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5. I read a review that said it worked great. It came in, the glass does not match up evenly with Samsung at the top of the phone. It does line up with the front camera or has a slot for the camera but it is too short and won't go all the way to the top."
1,"Works great, does what it says. Great buy."
-1,I like the case but the belt clip broke the first 5 minutes.  Fortunately Amazon and the Mfr refunded my purchase.
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
0,"Update: Customer service did a very good job in sending me another band. The second worked fine, but, it still doesn't fit perfectly the watch width and the band is longer than the original one. I moved from 1 to 3 stars because good service means a lot to me.  This is a product I bought to give as a gift to my son. The product clasp doesn't fit perfectly into the watch case. O, well, you should consider that the price is much lower than Apple's original one. That's still OK. However, one of the clasps doesn't LOCK into place in the watch case. You may even lose your watch if you're not attentive enough. Do I know how to handle it? Yes, I personally have the original one from Apple. I have not done anything wrong. As the full customer experience is not limited to the product functionality itself, I will update the review to let everybody know how the customer service will handle my return and my refund. The review can still be upgraded."
1,"Works great. I read a ton of reviews before purchasing. Stays in place. I've been super sweaty hiking in Arizona in the summer, doesn't budget. Phone is protected and has never come out of the casing wet. Like the other reviews say, a very thin case can fit inside. I have Galaxy 6 Ringke Slim case and it fits right in. I wear the armband usually about 4 times a week, hiking, lifting weights, doing stadiums, works well in every situation. My 1 complaint is that the little piece at the end of the arm strap, that weaves through so you can adjust the armband to your arm, is peeling back. The material has separated from the foamy armband, but just at that very end. Hopefully it won't keep peeling back and just stays right there at the end.  Had this since the end of May 2015."
1,Good
-1,THE PROTECT PLASTIC  IS BEGER FOR THE BLU PHONE. SO I HAVE CUT SOME OF THE PLASTIC.
1,Takes to long to charge
1,This is no good at all. Within a week it lost its strength and never held up well anytime at all.<br />Don't bother buy this product.
1,excellent
0,"ok , good idea but not very rugged. Broke within 1 weeks use."
1,Fits my Nook perfectly and working fine.
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
-1,"Bad fit, wish otter made case for maxx."
1,I love it
1,"I get this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am so excited to own this selfie stick since I don't have one and I get jealous on my friends. I have an iPhone 6 plus,I am so impressed  It holds my phone securely  as I take a picture of myself. The nice thing about this selfie stick is that comes up with a very nice packaging and you can tell already that this is a premium and quality made selfie stick. It is foldable and has a very sleek design unlike to the other selfie sticks I saw. It has a pouch for you to keep the stick in your purse! Loved the fact that it is easy to use.Unlike to other ones, this one is very unique! This is not Bluetooth device, All you have to do to is to plug the cord into the audio hole of your phone and Press the camera sign in the handle area of the stick and bam! Selfie   I would definitely recommend this product to everybody who loves taking selfies of themselves!"
1,Great product!!! Will be buying from them again.
1,The grip units on the back and side make it easy to hang onto.  Fits phone perfectly without adding to much to the overall size.
0,Like the case except I can not slide the mute button with the case
1,"Really good adapter. I've been using it for a few months without any issue. I noticed it works perfectly with my original Samsung cable, charges as fast as in a reagular plug. I honestly haven't try it with any other cable since I haven't had the need. Will update when I do."
1,"I am a woman with a tiny wrist, so I was worried that this watch (or any smartwatch) would look ridiculously big on my wrist. It's a bit big, but I love it! I wear it pretty loose so my wrist doesn't get sweaty.<br /><br />I love the way this watch looks, feels and functions. It charges super fast, so I can wear it all day, charge it for a bit, track my sleep, charge it a bit in the morning and it rarely goes below 50% charge.<br /><br />I found a Star Trek: TNG themed watch face that I love and looks great in the low power, black and white mode."
-1,Not too good quality sound..
1,"The red while charging and green when done works flawlessly. It is very sturdy, my phone responds every time and it is nice and long as a bonus. I plan to purchase a few more."
1,Great buy!  Good fit and easy to adjust.
-1,Bought this and it does not fit my lg stylo phone so not liking that at all. If they companies dont test these on the phones first why sell them waste of time and money
1,"I like everything about it except for when I take pictures with flash. I thought something was wrong with my phone. When I take pictures with the flash while the case is on, my pictures have an orange hue to them. So I either have to be in a place with great lighting or deal with the orange hue."
-1,Car charger and wall charger work well.  The usb one is not the same size as the others and does not fit the phone.
1,Excellent product and fast shipping
-1,"I really loved this phone case,  but after 2 months it started falling apart.  The seem on the side split open,  so now I'm shopping for a new one.  I ordered the magenta."
1,"For me this products works really good. I feel that my electronics get charged fast. I don't know if it's just me but I swear I feel they charge faster. There is no heating of the USB box. For me I didn't smell anything. Nice color and small not huge.  I can attach all my cables and everything gets charged great without interfering with each other. I feel that this USB is charged with great power I really recommend it. Works great with my iPhone 6 plus, my iPad, my table light, my little fan and my mini microphone and it all works perfect everything gets charged.  It is convenient no need to plug many charges in the outlet. This makes it more easy for me I can have it on my table and have all my USB connectors at my reach. Nice looking and has a soft touch with purple USB connectors. I know this product will last me a very long time.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion."
1,Excellent
0,"The battery is very bad, it died on me after one month. And the charger broke down won't charge."
0,"This was a nice case, just not as durable as we would have liked so we opted for an Otterbox."
-1,Front screen came out and it was hard to use the screen when it was on.
1,great battery I think better than oem battery
1,Great product
1,Great÷
1,Quick delivery and love the color!!
1,My mom was super happy with this. She still uses this case. Im so glad that I was able to get this for her.
1,"I love,very privacy,no body,see,my screen,1000% recomended,"
1,"I don't feel that the clear case offers much protection but my daughter has a gold iPhone and refuses to use a case to protect it because she doesn't want to cover up the phone case, which makes sense but  this phone cost a lot of money.<br />I was glad to get this for review, it is perfect for her to protect the finish on the phone without covering up her 'beloved' gold case, it makes me worry a little less that i twill get scratched up or broken.<br />However, we also have the black case with card holder and this case is fantastic, looks sleek and very functional."
1,I use it all the time for my GPS. Very useful. I like it.
1,"Used this for the first time today, and it was beyond perfect...<br />Exactly what I needed! Kept things simple :)"
1,Absolutely beautiful highly recommend
1,Best case I've ever seen/used... Protects in many ways and is super fancy. Love that you can see the brand on the back. Feels nice in your hand and is still streamlined enough to fit in the usual purse spot. would definitely recommend
0,"The video instructions for application were perfect and somehow I was able to apply it bubble free. I did have to use the other &#34;tools&#34; included which were just pieces of sticky tape, and sticky tabs. The privacy function kinda works; viewing the screen from the sides makes it way to dark to see unless you are directly looking at the front of the screen. However, even when looking at the screen directly, it made the screen much darker so I have to turn the brightness up in order to see, draining my battery. I also wouldn't suggest this dark privacy screen protector on a WHITE phone such as mine. It just looks funny and cheap. I am going to look for a clear privacy screen but for now, this will work."
1,"Fully functioning, kick butt sound. at a great price"
1,Worth more than the price!!!! It is very protective and its a cute pink color. Definetly ordering more.
1,Simple and great fit
1,"So I've had these for 5 months and find that they have some of the best battery life of my bluetooth headsets.  I mainly use them for audio books so cannot say the quality for music but the volume is good and clear.  I barely can use the for phone functionality though because of the poor mic.  I usually switch to handheld or say that I will call back if I cannot switch.<br /><br />I use these for 2 to 3 days listening off and on while doing chores, walking, sometimes driving (though I will pull one side off my ear to be able to hear outside better), etc..., before need to charge them.  This is hours of use, I can get through at least one book, which on average are 9-10 hours and then some.<br /><br />Little complaint- the blue light is too bright and quite distracting, especially inside and in darker rooms.<br /><br />Great headset, poor mic, great battery life"
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
1,"My original Garmin was stolen, probably when the shop detailed it.  I searched and even bought another one which had to be returned to another company.  This Garmin has worked very well plus it has traffic information.  Lifetime maps, etc.  The size is perfect.  The case I wanted is no longer made so that was disappointing but the Garmin is a great item."
-1,Bleu tooth microphone is very noisy wile driving person calling find it hard to hear me
1,Ok I pad
-1,Poor quality. Discoloration and flutter. Spent the extra money and get a quality screen
-1,"Do not buy from this company. I just relieved my iPhone case and it is complete junk. First if all, it says it's a speck case. It most definitely is not. The word 'speck' is just screen printed on the cheap plastic cover.  The picture shows impact rubber along the edges. False.  It doesn't have any.  It's literally the cheapest, flimsiest case I have seen. Do not waste your money."
1,Great case.  Great price
0,"Overall the case is great for the money with one flaw... It does not lay flat when the phone is facing up on a hard/flat surface. I understand the Moto G has a curved back but if you lay the phone down and try to use it, it just wobbles back and forth or spins.<br /><br />Ill be looking for a new case even thought I like everything else about."
1,Surprisingly good case at a great value price.
1,"Zerolemon continues to release great, economical products. In the pack are 3 screen protectors, individually packaged with a small squeegee and micro fiber cloth. Installation is very simple and straight forward. I had to lift my protector the while applying as a small dust particle was on the screen. I lifted the protector with a piece of tape and used another doubled over piece of tape to remove the particle.<br />The fit is great and covers the full face of the phone nicely. These protectors are a bit thinner than the glass shields and my clear phone case fit just right.<br />I've had the protector on my phone for right and three weeks now and have had no issues with edges lifting or peeling up. The PET protectors are silky smooth and I think my responsiveness is much better than the glass shields.<br />I have had no issues with scratching or discoloration, or haloing. I typically clean my screen once or twice a day with the same spray cleaner I use for my eyeglasses and my protector still looks and functions good as new.<br />Another great Zerolemon product!"
-1,"I got this stereo for the Subwoofer output. The output doesn't work, I'm getting no sound from my subs. Pretty frustrating."
-1,Seemed to work ok till the clip broke after about the 4th or 5th charge
1,BEST CHARGER
1,Great price. Awesome Rockford Fosgate quality. Definitely recommend this product.
1,This is a beautiful case it's exactly what I wanted. I recommend this to anyone. It fits perfectly and it's a wonderful color.
0,"It charges well using quick charge 2.0, but is poorly made. The entire unit is held together by a single metal ring up top, which has been very prone to slipping loose in my usage."
0,the shipping was very fast. i love how this case has a frosted back and the pink sides are really cute but my case broke 2 days later and it came bent sideways.
1,all good
1,"sleek and sturdy, two things I was looking for"
1,The band really inhanced the look of my stainless watch.
1,"It's perfect for charging on the go. Changing time is good too. As always, Anker my favorite electronic brand."
1,I like the style but the sound quality is a little tinny. Great deal for the price but if you want quality sound you will have to pay a lot more.
1,"I like it, only issue is that the borders are somewhat annoying when swiping pages, but I guess there is nothing that can be done as the edge of the iphone 6 is curved and the screen protector surface is flat and can not reach the curved part..."
1,"Wanted it to plug into my Mother's TV and drive  Bluetooth speaker that I could set next to her chair (she's quite hard of hearing).  Took many times to pair, but it eventually did and now have a remote, wireless speaker where she can hear the TV right at her ear (she refused headphones, so this is good).  Just wished the device came with a USB charger, so I had to buy a wall wart to keep it powered."
1,👍Im very satisfied with my screen protector. It was easy to put on. Now my boyfriend wants one for his phone. 👍
1,So secure -- almost like a suit of armor for your iPhone!!
1,Good
1,Awesome
1,This cover was part of a crazy phone covers phase that I had this week. Out of the four that I bought this one is my favorite. It easy to watch YouTube videos with the stand. It also had a futuristic look to it that I just like. I like the design and it protect well. It has hard plastic with a screen protector as well a a softer inner she'll. Recommend product.
0,"Does what it is supposed to. Links up fine, sound could be clearer"
0,It would be better with Bluetooth!
1,Good fine
1,Now I don't have to worry if my battery is low. Big help when losing power on my phone. I always bring it with me every time we go out of time. Love it.
-1,it worked well for about 3 and a 1/2 months and all of a sudden it would not charge.  When it was put to charge it smelled like it was burning.  I was so excited for this product but it was disappointing in the end.
0,"I don't know if it's my smart phone and my touch screen laptop or these pens but they only work some of the time.  The tip is a bit too wide which causes the same problems as using my finger - overlap of contact with keys.  If you expand your screen before tapping they work better, but the point was to make touch screen operation easier."
1,"Soooo glad I purchased! I bought this for a trip to  Mexico for me and my boyfriend. Super cheap way to go if you don't wanna do the whole go pro thing. We took underwater videos and they came out great! Enough room to put my galaxy s6 edge with a not so big case, money and hotel card. I put the money behind the hotel card to try and hide it. Definitely recommend this purchase."
1,"Fits quite well, and has stood up to a few &#34;gravitational incidents&#34;.  Controls are not affected, had no problem."
1,Excellent product. It doesn't slip on your arm and it fits perfectly.
0,Kinda pinches my bicep.
1,It's great I use it everyday makes it easier to hold my cards instead of taking my purse everytime
0,Good and easy to install but it breaks very easy
1,Overall I like the  cover.  The only problem with this product is the stick on clear screen.  It is almost impossible to put it on straight and get all the bubbles out from under it.  A tempered glass screen would work much better and wouldn't be near as frustrating as trying to put that darn thing on.
0,"The fabric coating worked so well at the beginning, but slowly it's worn out and ripped off from the head, exposing the inner plastic coating."
0,Tried these for my daughter who is a HUGE Iphone fan.  She did not feel this fit that well.
1,Good case
1,Yes it is a great case
1,still using it and sound is awesome with the preamp
-1,Can't but much in it:(
1,Metal. Heavyweight. Lots of adjustment angles. I use it every night when watching/listening to shows. Doesn't pull off the nightstand easily so I don't have any worries if I fall asleep with the headset connected to the phone. The edges are padded so it does not scratch a surface if it does slide.
1,"Love the WeMo switch. Works great, never had aproblem a problem so far."
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
1,I  like it
1,Great product
1,Fits well
0,Gorgeous case. Bought it at the Apple Store for around the same price but now sadly after a few months the yellow edge it's becoming detached from the case... It's coming a part little by little.
1,"This is a great little phone ,really good price for Samsung."
1,"Came quickly through the mail and is exactly as pictured. Was easy to put on and is easy to remove. Fits my Samsung Galaxy Core Prime perfectly. Cute, good quality phone case for a good price. Very happy."
1,Worked great!
0,Poor quality image
-1,I had these for 3 days and the remote to control the volume and to pause and play the music did not work the cord is very bad as well.
1,"Best car charger I've ever purchased. Both a Quick Charge 2.0 port which we all know charges capable phone's extremely fast, but also has a regular 2.4A port that also charges crazy fast! It charged a full sized laptop from empty to full in a bit over an hour. (Drive from Jersey Shore to Jersey City)"
1,Arrived quickly and just as described
1,"In terms of price vs. functionality, this is the best smart-watch currently available.  There are simply no two ways about it.  It has many features; but the most important is robust voice-command functionality.  It is also stylish; people often ask me, &#34;is that an Apple Watch?&#34;  I tell them, &#34;no; it's about a quarter of the price.&#34;  This is especially satisfying if the asker is wearing an Apple watch.<br /><br />The point of a smart-watch, as far as I can tell, is to keep you from having to pull your phone out of your pocket.  This watch accomplishes that purpose, with aplomb.  The watch includes a built-in speaker, so that you can take calls on it.  You talk, and it talks back to you.  You don't think you will ever need or use this feature... until you need it.  I swore I would never take a call on my watch; but sometimes, you find that it's just convenient.<br /><br />The built-in speaker dovetails nicely with the watch's most important feature: voice control.  When paired with my LG G2, running the latest version of Android, I can use its voice command feature to initiate Google Now.  It works, even if the phone is locked, in my pocket.  This means that I can send text messages, check the weather, look up and call phone numbers, convert weights and measures on the fly, and more, without ever having to touch my phone in my pocket.  This, in my opinion, is the best feature of this, or any, smart-watch.  I've taken to text messaging my wife during the day, while I'm working, just because this watch makes it easy; certainly easier than picking up my phone to fiddle with a touch keyboard.  It goes like this:<br /><br />Me: &#34;Text message to Scout Finch mobile: 'hi, honey; just checking in to say I love you.' &#34;<br /><br />Sykla M1: &#34;Here is your text message to Scout Finch: 'Hi, honey, just checking in to say &#34;I love you.&#34; ' Do you want to send it?&#34;<br /><br />Me:  &#34;Yes.&#34;<br /><br />Sykla M1: &#34;Sending message.&#34;<br/><br />The heart-rate function works; something I cannot say for, e.g., Zeaplus's DM360.  Alarm, pedometer, SMS, also work.  You have seven [stylish!] watch faces to choose from; you can even set up a different face for each day of the week.  Switching them on the fly is easy; most days, I just pick one based on my mood.<br /><br />Let's talk about the hardware  The build of the watch is solid.  It's constructed of metal, and hard plastic; the band is an attractive leather.  It is not flimsy; I have banged it, scraped it, and abused it in any number of ways, without impacting functionality.  The watch is truly waterproof; you will have a devil of a time using the touchscreen if there are a few beads of water on it; but, you can submerge it, and keep it under, and it does just fine.  I would say that it takes a licking and keeps on ticking, but strictly speaking, it does not tick.<br /><br />The hardware for this watch is manufactured by MIMI Sangfeida, in China; but, rather than buying direct, I recommend this version, which is rebranded by &#34;Rezilient Company LLC&#34; in Georgia.  The watches faces available with the M1, seven in total, are much more stylish than the ones that come with the Chinese version.  I typically advise buying goods direct from China, rather than on Amazon, to save money; but, in this case, it make sense, because the Sykla's better watch-faces add value, without adding much to the price.<br /><br />Nitpicky issues: you have to be in pedometer mode, for the pedometer to work; otherwise, your steps will not be recorded.  Long SMS messages don't always come through; you will see a truncated version on the watch.<br /><br />The cheapest Android Wear smartwatch right now is the LG G Watch; which, if you are a savvy shopper, can be found for around the same price as this watch.  But, it doesn't have a built-in speaker.  This one does; and, because it works with Google Now, it basically includes all the features of an Android Wear device.  Buyit.  Love it.  Gloat about how much less you paid.  If you want to drop more coin on an Android Wear watch later, more power to you.  But, this one does everything you need it to do."
-1,Broke in 3 days
-1,Unfortunately it did not work.  It feels extremely cheap
-1,I thought it was a privacy protector but people can still see my screen so I'm not satisfied with it
1,"Excellent price, excellent quality. It was not too bulky and my dad found it acceptable, which means it is great. It actually looks very sleek and modern. On regards to safety, it appears very sturdy and fits the phone well. I definitely recommend it."
-1,Cheap cheap cheap!!!! Plus it interfered with my reception
1,Very loud. easy to work. Lasting battery.
-1,protects well but kickstand broke in the first 20 mins of use
-1,Didn't work for my lg g3 at all. Screen would not activate on case was on. Case looked sturdy by was useless to me because it didnt allow my phone to work
-1,"Too tight, very hard to put the cellphone in that cover."
0,The phone case is a little small
1,"Love the case, exactly how described"
-1,i love the colors but it doesnt fit on my phone and it really annoys me so i wouldn't buy another one of these cases again
1,"I bought Liger wireless bluetooth earbuds earphones for my  gym day.I do like listening music while exercising  but  I always having problem with the other headphones Ive used if not too big or because of the wire and keep distracting me on my exercising.<br />Since I have this Liger wireless bluetooth it solved my problem.This is very comfortable,with control button .<br />I got this product at discounted price."
-1,"I have used C4 company model Q cases, and like them very much for holding business cards.  The SLITE model is cheap looking silicone, rather than textured faux leather. Also, the card slot is not wide enough to hold business cards- just credit card or ID."
1,"Very fancy, has endured quite a bit so far.  Pleased with the product."
1,Works perfectly!
1,Work great...inexpensive and seem to hold a charge very well.
-1,not good. Use original one..
0,It was good headset but don't buy if you wear glasses
1,Works well with lots of credit card and magnets hold very well.
1,"It was not broken or scratched, I've had it more a month and it's still in good condition, no cracks, even after dropping it many times."
1,Wow
1,"This product went beyond my expectations. I don't leave reviews but when I got an e-mail requesting to do so, I jumped right on it. You won't be disappointed by investing in this case."
1,Got this case as a gift...it arrived in a timely manner and the person loved it! Glad the Star of Life Defender case was finally made available for iPhone 6!!
1,The product did what I wanted it to.  No problems.
1,"When I first bought this product I thought it would be a cheap poorly made speaker but it turned out when I received it, it was already partly charged and I had no problems connecting it to my phones Bluetooth. The sound was surprisingly loud for its compact size. The suction cup on the bottom worked perfectly fine on my wall and my window. On the device there are volume up, volume down, and play/pause buttons. There is also an on/off switch and a led light indicator. Overall this is a great product for the price."
1,Really liked the size of the cover and how smooth it is. Also love the bit of bright green that doesn't seem overwhelming but fit right in to my other bright green stuff . Also protects the screen well
0,I can't get most apps I want or need!!!
-1,"Great in theory, but doesn't work well enough to rely on. Gets really hot and only charges my iPhone 1/3 of the time. Also very slow."
1,"Great case that looks good and great protection. With a couple flaws.<br /><br />1) The rubber part that goes on first is to soft and moves around, also creates a pocket grabber trying to take in and out of your pocket.<br /><br />2) The power button is hard to push. It's too flush abs you really need to push hard to use it.<br /><br />3) This isn't really a flaw but a notice to others. The orange color is close but not like the pic. It's more of a yellowish orange. Which isn't bad but I was expecting the orange in the pic. Again this isn't a flaw just a heads up for others.<br /><br />I would've given it 3 stars because of the flaws but considering this is only 7.99 with prime shipping I gave it 4 stars. Hard to beat it for the price and this level of protection.<br /> I would have preferred the hard plastic or a stiffer rubber around the top and bottom to keep it from grabbing my pocket.<br /><br />Oh and as far as size goes I would consider it close to a otter box defender. But looks way better imo."
-1,It was broken when I received it in the mail :(
0,perfect case for samsung galaxy note first generation
1,"Everything fine, nice & useful as expected & good delivery service..."
1,Love this connection it works perfectly and i have no complaints.
1,My husband loves this watch. He uses it for his bike rides and walking. It is very easy to use. Definetly recommend!
-1,It is not as slick as it looks but it s useful
1,"I got this for my car (Fiat 500c) and it works really well. I put the rectangular (not sticky, which was also included in the order) magnet between my phone(Galaxy S6) and the case. It's a very strong magnet and sticks to my phone really well, but I can also easily rotate my phone to landscape mode while it's attached.<br /><br />The car vent part was great. It holds the phone perfectly and the part that attaches to the vent is a soft rubber so it doesn't scratch. I also imagine it would fit various vent sizes. It didn't cover the whole vent and allowed for plenty of air flow.<br /><br />Here is what I thought of as a postive, but maybe it's a negative for some. When I pull my phone off, it takes the vent clip with it. I personally only use this when I need my GPS, and since my car is a tiny clown car, I hate extra things when I'm not using them. So I then pull it from my phone and store it in the door slot. I love it. It's easy on, easy off, it's perfect.<br /><br />My only slight bummer is that you can't wirelessly charge your phone while the magnet is on. So I just stick that to the vent clip and store them together. Then I slip the magnet into the case when I need it. If you don't wirelessly charge, then keep the magnet in all the time! It's super thin and I don't notice it at all."
-1,No NFC = no flagship
1,"I love this case, with one reservation: It is not convenient for holding cash. Bills must be folded more than once, and then they're too thick to insert into the case. However, other cases aren't any better in this regard, and this is the most aesthetically pleasing case I've seen offered."
1,Great fit and looks elegant.
1,"This product is very simple to install and fits seamlessly to the Galaxy Note 5. The kit comes with an alcohol wipe, microfiber cloth, 2 dust remover stickers, and 1 glass screen protector. I first cleaned the phone with the alcohol wipe, wiped it off with the microfiber cloth, and then used a dust remover sticker over the entire surface of the screen. After cleaning the phone, I lined the glass screen protector up and placed it flat upon the phone. It will gradually &#34;suction&#34; to the screen of the phone - this is a huge improvement from the sticky plastic screen protectors that you had to gradually apply and almost always resulted in a few bubbles. There was one air bubble left over after the glass protector suctioned to the screen, and I was easily able to slide it out through the periphery with my microfiber cloth. The glass protector is exceptionally clear and feels just like the phone screen. I have not noticed any color distortion with this product. There is about a 2 mm margin between the edge of the screen protector and the edge of the phone, but I did not feel this to be terribly noticeable. I think the margin is actually a perk because it prevents you from applying the protector too close to the edge, which would inevitably prevent the edges of the protector from laying flush against the screen. I would absolutely purchase this product again in the future."
1,"A selfie stick is a handy thing to have and this one is easy to use, plus the price is right. You do have to ensure that the cord is inserted all the way in order to snap the pic. The one complaint that I have about this style selfie stick is that, while keeping my phone secure from dropping, the hinged area hits right where the power button is on my Android Galaxy Avant phone so, if I'm not careful, it presses on the power and turns my phone off."
1,Works fantastic! So convenient!
1,"You get what you pay for. These can't be as good as Bose or perhaps a few other much more expensive choices, but for the roughly $100 price range they offer great value and quality. Meanwhile, if you have a larger head, these might be not as comfortable. Finally, they don't seem to isolate up to 94% or so of background noise as claimed, but still, they are good and worth the $100."
1,I own jay birds i love them but i was shocked at quality of these for price would buy again.
1,Very good!
-1,"I wore these twice, and I was very disappointed. They're heavy and didn't fit well in my ears (even when I swapped the ear bud pieces for my second run with them). The sound quality was poor, and the signal strength connecting with my iphone was disappointing. The purchase was an unfortunate waste of my money; my regular ear buds work so much better."
1,Very Good! It is really sensitive to finger prints though!
1,"FINALLY -- a long cable that works well with a Dell Venue 11 Pro.  I tried at least 6 other cables until finding this one, and it's the ONLY one I've tried (other than the ridiculously short Dell cable)) that will allow my DV11P to charge while in use.  This is not the cheapest cable out there, but I probably would have saved money in the long run if I'd just bought this first instead of wasting time trying all the others.  The green connector actually makes it easy to quickly spot the right cable in my bag, which is an unexpected plus."
1,They work great and price was great . Bought 2
1,Works as it should and seems really well made
-1,please read & take warning its a fake. sucks & not worth the money returning asap!!
0,"Stick works great.  However, the clicker is cheap and stops working within a month."
1,Can't be beat for the price
1,Works great
-1,Not Apple headset. One was broken I just threw them away. I'm very glad I didn't spend a lot of money on them.
1,"Great case.. Smooth, clean, sleek n durable.. Yes u can get a 40$ or 50$ case n get the EXACT same thing but I like $1.99 much better.."
-1,This cover cracked easily and also discolored.  Did not  effectively protect the phone.
1,ok
-1,It was really nice for a couple of days. It did make me lose service every once in a while. But after only a few days of use it no longer charges my phone. It just doesn't power on. I'm going to find a better one.
1,I love it and it fits my phone perfectly.
1,Love it
1,Worked as promissed
1,Diodes were in good conditions and functioned.
1,loveit
-1,"I was very disappointed with this watchI, I would not recommend anyone purchasing this product, I found it to be very difficult to program (usually I'm good at programming devices ) and in my opinion is very poorly made.  My plan was to see how I like it and then order a few more for my friends and relatives. Not only would I not order it for my friends and relatives I'm ready to throw this piece of crap in the trash. the only reason I gave it a one is because it wouldn't let me submit with 0 stars"
-1,Color comes off
1,I got this case because... uhm... because cats!!! It's super adorable! I love it! I love all stuff with cats on it.
1,Great
1,"Just like my headline says, this is a great product; Aukey Portable charger. Starting from the premium feel/look, to the vital function of it's Quick Charging capability, this product has charged my Samsung Galaxy S6 and my sister's iPhone 5 multiple times; $30 is a more than reasonable price-tag."
-1,It says its lifetime warranty but it doesn't work anymore it completely stopped charging anything like my phone an tablet
0,"It only works good with the fast charger. If not then it keeps cycling (charging then stop charging, then charging) which is bad for the battery. might as well connect it to the fast charger at that point..."
1,I love it!!!
-1,Did not fit well
0,"My initial review after having this for a day or so. I will update my review in about two weeks after having used it day in and day out.<br /><br />Right out of the box it's very attractive and easy to set up. I love that I can use it three different ways. Wear it as a bracelet, on my clothing or as a necklace! I work in a hospital so being able to wear it on my person is very helpful especially with all of the gloves and hand washing I do!<br /><br />As of right now it's a very simple activity tracker that appears to only have two alarms and a pill reminder. As for accuracy of the &#34;steps&#34; taken throughout the day I can't really say just yet and I will include that in my updated review two weeks from now.<br /><br />Cons: Doesn't appear to be able to sync with ihealth app (iPhone). Although, I'm hoping that since it's so new that it will be an added feature in the firmware.<br /><br />Would like more than two alarms. So far that doesn't seem to be an option but also hoping that's included in future firmware updates.<br /><br />UPDATE!!!!<br /><br />I've used it constantly for about a week and have decided to update my review earlier than I said I would.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Beautiful<br />Can wear with anything (dressy or casual)<br />Easy to wear<br />Secure and does not feel like it will fall off<br />Love that I don't have to charge it every so often<br />Easy to sync<br /><br />CONS:<br />Not accurate (steps or sleep)<br />Not able to manually edit my sleep (explanation below)<br /><br />Does not sync with apple iHealth app (yet?)<br />Only three (3) alarms<br /><br />Ok, now for the explaining! As I previously mentioned I work in a hospital so I get a lot of steps in! Sometimes about 12k (12,000) but on average 10,500 or so. The leaf has been about 2k to 3k steps off which is a lot.<br /><br />I don't like that the app is glitchy, I tried to adjust my slee since one night I went to bed at 9pm. The app was glitching out on me and would change the time to AM as opposed to pm! Strange, but I guess it's to be expected from a first generation product? I still like a lot but as far as accuracy goes I'm really hoping that the programmers will fix the bugs and fine tune it soon as well as add the additional alarms and make it compatible with Apple iHealth.oes I'm really hoping that the programmers will fix the bugs and fine tune it soon as well as add the additional alarms and make it compatible with Apple iHealth."
1,As advertised
1,i have had this on my phone for about 3 months and works great!! it's so cheap and works great! five stars
1,I love these cases because I can create my own case.  I just insert a design on paper in between my phone and the clear case.  I change this up every now and then when I want something new.
1,Works like a champ
1,"Works great and it will keep my S3 useful for another year or 2, saves me from buying another phone. And for the price, can't beat it"
1,"Yes, this item satisfies my needs and is working properly !"
1,Great case
1,Great! I love my Cellphone. thanks :D so good!
-1,"I don't normally write negative reviews, but this stuff smells SO bad that I can't even use it after the first time. I bought it for work since I'm in healthcare and we're going to a tablet based system for documentation. I figured between patients I would want an antibacterial cleaner not just the 'iclean' I've used for years for my phone. I tried it out on my iPhone upon opening it and it just smells terrible - I had to use my other cleaner to try to get the scent off but it took 4 tries over about 3 hours. It smells like B.O. and honesty like feces. And others around you will smell it too - it's strong. I really would save your money."
1,Love it!
-1,"I read all these great reviews and was excited to receive my product.  I'm not sure if I just got a lemon, but the volume buttons (left side of the phone when holding it as if to talk) on this case do not align properly with the buttons on my Samsung Galaxy S6.  As such, I can  only turn the volume up when the case is on, unless I use the touch screen.  I will be returning the case immediately because it does not fit properly."
1,"tremenda maquina,.,."
0,This case is cute but gets scratched really easy.
-1,I bought this screen and it worked but my Touch ID stop working now I have to discard my iPhone 6
1,This is a real charger not like those fake 2.1A chargers
1,So far they have been really got
1,"Sound quality and fit is good for the price, but don't expect to be blown away."
1,Where my Fitbit all the time and I almost lost if three times. I was really lucky to have found the Bitbelt. Very inexpensive fix to an expensive gift from my children.
1,"Everyone these days has a phone, but it has become a hazard to keep it in a pocket with people around who may do things like shove you into a pool or turn on the garden hose. Thank goodness I had my phone in my waterproof iPhone case by u deserve tech, because this happened to me just the other day. My husband and I were playing outside with the kids with the garden hose. It was hot and everyone was getting wet. I had my phone in it's case in my pocket, My husband suddenly turned the hose on me and laughed when I got soaked. It took him a minute to stop and realize my phone was with me and asked if it was okay or if we needed to sit it in a container of rice. I pulled it out and showed him it was in my case safe and sound. He was relieved but soaked me again. It worked fantastic. No issues with leaking or anything. A nice high quality case. Keep yourself safe from people and water. Because no warranty these days covers water damage.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND HAS NOT BEEN INFLUENCED OR ALTERED IN ANY WAY"
1,"This case is perfect.  Very thin, very flexible and soft.  The clear one shows off the Note 5 very well.  Provides secure grip.  The phone is very slippery without a case.  It would probably slip out of my hands without this case.  The S Pen is easy to grab with this case."
0,came more slowly than anticipated and the battery runs down much too soon.
1,My phone had fell on concrete and it fell on its face and it did not crack
1,Easy to use..practical and effective.
1,Perfect.
1,"I ordered this along with the 8400 model and the 24 watt wall charger.  I wanted it for power outages as well as travel.  The products arrived on time and with all the goods included. This unit came 75% charged but charged to 100% within a couple of hours.  Instructions were easy to understand and carry out.  I will keep this one at home and use the 8400 for traveling.  Both units have a sturdy, qualitative feel to them - like all parts fit like they should, with good quality materials.  I do not anticipate any issues with this unit."
1,"I love this case. It's durable, sleek, and not too big. Highly recommend. Great for the price."
1,looks very nice on my phone..
-1,"I want to rate this product 5 stars but I can't. The product will not hold up an S6 at any angle at all without falling and the arms do not grip.<br /><br />I would normally make a note that the claw is hardly one,  etc,  etc but the young lady apologized and even sent one of her new design but the arms do not hold any better and the individual pieces fall apart now.<br /><br />I am rating this a 2 star as the owner really did try and if she can fix the design I would change it to a 5 star."
-1,"I had another case from amazon on my phone but it was getting worn out from a year of use. I bought this one because of its look and thought it would be made the same as my other case.<br /><br />I dropped my phone from 18&#34; and the screen shattered which cost me $130 to get it replaced. I would never recommend this brand to anyone, the case is not slim, it is bulky and does not look near as good on the phone as the stock image. DO NOT BUY"
1,👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
0,"The case looks phenomenal, and is very durable. However, it is so slippery (just like an iPhone without a case...), that in the past 2 days I have used the case, I have dropped my phone numerous times."
-1,I have a iPhone 6 plus I used this cord about 15 times and it's now saying my cable not compatible with this cord..😕😕😕. So I would not recommend this cord for a iPhone six plus and I have a iPad Air a Two same thing won't work I'm always looking for the best cords for my phone and this is not one.
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
1,Order the wrong ones.  But will use on other stuff
0,"This case IS NOT a smart case despite the fact that the title says it is. It doesn't seem very well made either. In fact, the rubbery part that actually holds the iPad is loose, and yes, it is the correct case for my iPad. It doesn't seem to close tight because the card slot edges actually stick up. Nothing holds the case closed except its own weight. It is very pretty, though and the colors are bolder than they look in the pictures. It was pretty inexpensive, too, or it would have gotten fewer stars."
1,"UPDATE 9/27: CHANGED REVIEW FROM ONE TO FIVE STARS.<br />Tech Armor reached out to me and gave me a replacement protector with one day free shipping. I have not applied the new protector yet, but will update when I do.<br /><br />This is the second screen protector I have purchased from Tech Armor and both have not worked out for me. Both of my protectors have not completely adhered to my phone. The top corners aren't stuck down, so there are ugly half moons at the top.<br />Attempting to get a replacement from their site tells me &#34;sorry, but this happens.&#34;<br />Will not purchase again, I learned my lesson."
-1,Not good my phone fell off my hip with the clip and still my screen cracked.
1,Beautiful sturdy case.
1,Great!!!!!!!!!!
1,Perfect high quality and beefier cord than the thin wire that comes with apple devices. i would certainly recommend this cord to anyone. it works with iphone5 and ipad air for charging.
1,It charges my Windows Phone at about 1% per minute in late afternoon direct sun here in Arizona.  Good product.
-1,Super cute but the shark came off the phone in less than a week.  The words stayed on but not the design.  Really disappointing.
1,"Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Starting with the design, it’s made mostly of a matte plastic that feels really nice and is not slippery at all. There are cut-outs for both mics, the camera, the flash, the charging port, the headphone jack, the IR blaster and finally, the speaker. It comes in two separable pieces, one flimsy piece that fits the phone perfectly, then a hard shell piece that makes the case more durable and protective. Speaking of durability, this case is a great combo between thinness and protection. The corners are padded and all three buttons are protected, but still tactile; to add-on, the case is still fairly thin. The case does not remove any functionality and looks really good. Coming from an expensive Otterbox, I am very impressed with this case, they even included a stylus and a screen protector, with a microfiber cloth! Anyway, thanks for reading my review, bye!"
-1,"I had originally given this product a very positive review, after buying it in July 2015.<br />But unfortunately by November 2015 the device simply died. It had always fed the same two Nexus 7 tablets, which are still alive and well, except it doesn't charge them anymore, nor does the blue &#34;On&#34; light turn on, as if some (inaccessible) internal fuse has blown.<br />BTW the plane's voltage is monitored carefully, and even logged for each flight, and it's always around 27.5v.<br />When you click on &#34;warranty info&#34; for this product on the Amazon site, you get a message &#34;see manufacturer's website&#34;, and on that site I have been unable to find any useful warranty service info.<br />So as bottom line, assuming my experience is typical, this device may work for a while and then die a few months later, with no obvious way to get warranty service.<br />Buyer beware!"
1,"I like that this wall charger has the ability to charge 2 different devices at the same time. It does seem to deliver a quicker charge than the older wall chargers I already own. I've used it to charge my iPad 3 and iPhone 6 without getting any type of error message which is the case lately with the non-Apple charging devices I already own. If you don't use both USB ports, you can see a blue glowing light coming from the one that's not in use. But it's not bright or annoying. I would recommend the iClever wall charger. I think it's a good value for the price."
1,Very nice case
1,I love these. They're great to ensure your Fitbit stays on and the colors compliment my bands with a splash of color.
1,"[[ASIN:B013I3MGH0 Etekcity 2pcs Auto-Smart 360° Universal Car Mount Holder - Windshield Cradle for Smartphone iPhone 6/Plus/5/4S/4 Samsung Galaxy S6/S6 Edge/S5/S4/S3 Note 4/3 HTC One Google Nexus 5/4 LG G3]]<br />Impressed by the oversized suction cup footprint which makes a solid bond on slick surfaces without water. Once fastened, the mount is unmovable. There are two adjustments made with locking nuts that secures the phone solidly into viewing position. The best feature of the mount is a quick release or quick secure ratchet mechanism that locks the phone itself into the cradle and with the press of a side button, easily releases the phone for storage. Very clever and thoughtful from a user's point of view.<br />The side clips and bed are rubber padded so as to not scratch one's phone. However, the pad on the bed itself does not cover the entire surface. In the interest of economy, they've attached a large circular rubber pad that provides adequate protection for the back of the phone.<br />Overall, the cradle is solidly made within the confines of all-plastic construction. Hopefully the ratchet mechanism is substantial enough to last through hundreds of cycles of attachment and removal. Too early to tell.<br />Two units for the advertised price seems pretty reasonable.<br />Disclaimer: I have purchased a camping stove from this company and was so impressed with the quality, I became a user/reviewer. I received one cradle unit gratis in exchange for an honest review. I would recommend this unit to friends and family without qualification."
0,"I love the way it looks and the size, and everything was working fine, but it was not powerful enough, so I returned it. if you're looking to buy substantial bookshelf speakers (like these - http://www.amazon.com/Pioneer-SP-BS22-LR-Designed-Bookshelf-Loudspeakers/dp/B008NCD2LG), you'll need to spend money on an amplifier anyway. At that point, you're better just getting a normal-size/price integrated amp."
1,Very good devices got the green and black ones and both work with my iPhone6+ and Nexus6 tested with camera for pics will keep you updated with video.
1,Looks really nice with gold iPhone. Installed on an iPhone with tempered glass.
1,"Great product ,works very good !"
1,It's a lot of fun. Never thought I would buy one but super easy to use. No longer have to ask someone to take family picture.
1,Super! The size u need for iPhone 6!!!!
-1,I have tried this on three different vehicles and it did not work on any of them.  It doesn't fit in the vents properly and the weight of the phone constantly pulls it to a downward viewing angle.  Can't recommend this product at all.
1,"Charges quickly, fits well in the lighter socket.  Like the little blue light that reminds me it's plugged in.  This is my second AmazonBasics charger (lost the first one) and I've been happy with both."
1,"Works great. On a full charge, it'll charge about 3 to 4 phones. Charging it up from a dead battery to full battery takes a bit, quicker than what I would have expected for 10,000. It's a great device, quality is nice has a really nice feel to it. I use it mainly for concerts/festivals and when I go camping or somewhere I don't have an outlet. I recommend it to anybody needing a portable battery great price too"
1,Cannot wait to receive mine this would be helpful when I'm driving and use my phone for gps same time
1,Product just as advertised. Great merchant
1,Good product
-1,The feel of the material is very cheap. Gonna have to look for something better quality.
1,Just like OEM. Worked great and small screwdriver is a must.
1,"The first set of cables I got had problems but Anker support helped me out. The replacement cables work well and can accommodate a thick case, though mine is very thin. Used the cables daily at work for a year and never had a problem with the pins getting weak."
1,Beautiful case. Got my phone very nicely. Well pleased
1,"I like the case, it looks & feels nice. It wasn't what I pictured it look like especially in comparison to the pictures, but overall it's nice."
1,Walmart now has this phone for $49. I am stunned a piece of tech this advanced can be purchased so cheaply nowadays. This phone feels like it costs $200+. I broke my galaxy s4 mini and picked this phone up at Walmart. I like this phone equally as much at a fraction of the price. The screen isn't quite as good on  paper but looks just as good as the s4 mini. The camera isn't quite as good but it still takes pretty impressive pics. It handles android 5.1 like a phone that costs 5x the price.<br /><br />I am not sure if there is a way to bypass the activation screen but if so this phone is a steal without even using it as a phone. I rarely write reviews but I am so satisfied I felt I had to share how I felt and hopefully sway a few people that are about to spend hundreds of dollars to just save it.
0,Ear piece didn't fit well
1,Great for walking so I'm not holding my phone any more!
1,Great
1,Work much better than my expectations. My Garmin Nuvi 65LM fit perfectly in the center of the Nav-Mat and stay secure in the correct position.
-1,Late
1,Love it
-1,Did not like the quality of this at all!!
1,Do great this product is great throughout.  The best thing  about them is you can't beat the cost!
1,Phone works great
-1,Thin and not what was described.
1,Received the product quickly and it is as promised.  Works great and the magnet holds my Galaxy5 no problem.  The unit is compact and fits snug on my air vent.  Thank you!
1,So far so good!. I like the little multiple adapters it comes with!.
1,espectacular 100% recomendado
0,Rx Audio is a 5-star.  Tx audio is muffled.  Even the typical drilling out the mic hole and removing the splash/air membrane mod isn't very effective.  Otherwise it is OK.
1,Excellent product
1,Better build quality than Apples own plus much less in price. Highly recommend.
1,Its an amazing screen protector Iv'e dropped mine about 20 times and ive had it on for a year. Definitely recommend it.
1,"This case is really nice. It has a smooth edges around the case to give it a sleek style. The case is a made of a an impact-resistant, transparent outer hardshell and co-molded, shock-absorbing inner Diagrid, or diagonal grid core to keep your phone stay safe from dropping and safe from being scratched. This case is easy to put on and feels good in my hands. I would recommend this case. Great price for a great case. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review."
1,I ordered the case and within three days it was here! Looks great on the tablet it's not bulky at all I love it!
-1,This key board is a piece of garbage if you have a Mac.
1,as expected
1,Worked good for a while and after 3 days the selfie stck with glue came out and it did not hold the IPhone 6 plus. The company sent me a new one. This worked very well with iphone 6. With 6 plus it is heavy and unsteady but worked great with iphone 6!
1,The product itself is exactly as it's advertised. It has a leather look and to be sincere it looks like a wallet from afar. The issue I had is that the card will eventually scratch the phone if it does not have a screen protector. Late thinking on my side. Other than that the product is good to Cary essentials in a quick and easy manner.
-1,Didn't work. Got not compatible message and it didn't charge. Had to get one from service provider!
-1,All ready broken from taking my phone out to charge.  It's not built to take it in and out from the plastic it should've been rubber to stand the activities.
-1,The phone lasted for three weeks before it started over heating.  I contacted Amazon buat was told it could not be replace because it was a gift.  I contacted the person who ordered for me. They tried to do a return but was told it was too late.  The phone is only three weeks old.
1,"At 14.0 ounces and 2.5” X 2.5” X 7” this is one powerhouse of a Bluetooth speaker.  The sound is driven by two 5-watt speaker (not the usual three) with a (vibrating diaphragm) subwoofer.  The sound is just fantastic.  The functions are on the top and include a button for a light (it’s very bright), Volume Up/Fast Forward, Volume Down/Reverse and Play/Pause.  On the back side is a rubber flap that covers an auxiliary 3.5mm input for a cable, a TP Card insert (for your own songs on a card), an input USB for powering up and  the On/Off witch.  It pairs immediately with a triple beep.  It is definitely water resistant, but I would never place in underwater for more than a few seconds.  It could fall into a pool and survive if caught, but very few Bluetooth speakers are completely waterproof.  Still it’s in the proper price range for the sound quality.  Product supplied for review."
-1,Doesn't fit my 5c as advertised waste of money
1,"Hard shell that protects phone well, but maintains the slim profile. Phone sits comfortably in front pants pocket without feeling like a block of wood."
1,It was an insanely good deal and it'll charge my phone while it's charging itself. The flashlight is nifty although I haven't used it yet.
-1,The connection for the micro usb gets loose and makes it hard to charge. I've had it for about a month and have had issues. I've purchase be usb cables a d have the same issue.  there have been a couple of times I wake up and my phone is not charging. If you do get a full charge it will last pretty much all day
1,"The first one worked great for a few months, then wouldn't hold a full charge. They sent me a replacement right away and it's worked fine ever since. I would suggest they change the case to a softer material like silicone, but it sure is nice to have a battery that lasts several days!"
-1,Doesn't work right
1,"Love this case. Fits nicely and love the design, had a few people commenting on it saying they want one."
1,Love this bluetooth headset.  Wear them at work every day. Sound great and are comfortable. I did have one side stop working not long after getting  them but the company sent me a new pair and they have been good ever since.
1,"Amazing! Charges insanely fast.  So convenient to not have to carry around any other cords. Literally plug this into a wall when your using your phone then pull it out and plug it to your phone when you need to.  So simple.  Not bulky by any means.  The pouch is great and the adapters are helpful too for your non-iphone devices (though the lightning-to-30pin adapter was made incorrectly and is utterly useless for older iphones because it doesn't fit in an apple 30 pin slot).  The battery indicator light is gives you an idea about how many times you can juice up before having to recharge the pack (I've gotten 4 full charges on my iphone 6 from one full pack).<br /><br />the only concerning thing would be the location of the outlet connector.  Because it's all the way at the top end, if you plug the pack into a horizontal wall outlet it will feel like its putting undue stress on its connectors (almost as if it might bend over time if used this way repeatedly).  this is not to say it's flimsy or anything because this hasn't happened when I've done it.  I've charged it this way a couple of times out of necessity without any issues, but I usually try to find outlets with the slots aligned vertically to be extra nice to my pack and just be safe."
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
1,My son loves it!
-1,"looks cheap very disappointed, threw it out."
1,Looks good but it won't give much protection.
1,"Good buy, works as stated."
1,"it is working very good , thank you!"
1,"Product in good condition, just as advertised - thanks!"
1,"This case surpassed my expectations. It feels sturdy, has a nice, easy to grip surface, and the magnet closure works well. The only flaw is that the phone holder seems a tiny bit loose on the right side, but that could just be because it's new and a little stiff. It holds the phone snugly, so I don't think that will be a problem. I recommend it."
-1,"Doesn't fit into my Galaxy Note 4, at all. Would give zero stars if able."
1,"I was involved in a motorcycle accident, at 65 mph.  My bike slid five lanes of traffic and I slid three.  When I popped up, the phone was still secured to the mount with the bungee strap.  Very impressed with this mount that I'm going to buy it again for my next motorcycle.  Awesome product.  Highly recommended."
1,"It's def far better than the cheap craps you can found online, much more sturdy. But, you fit much in it. That is if you put a card in every pocket, you won't be able to close it ."
0,"UPDATE:  The watch screen broke about 5 months after my purchase.  Amazon is great, they have a watch repair service that covers 1 year after your purchase.  However, they were unable to repair this watch and instead refunded my purchase price.  Wound up getting another model watch phone (ZGPAX S82).  Then, a few months later, it broke as well.  I didn't do anything to cause the cracked glass in either case other than wear the watch.  If you buy this, expect it to last only a short time and remember this post about the warranty (JMHO).  I loved the watch, but the glass needs to be much more durable...  Taking off 2 starts for this reason.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Best watch phone I've ever owned and I've had quite a few.  The Google Store works great for downloading new apps.  I'm impressed by the sheer number of apps. that work on it.  Only improvements I could see, allow user-replaceable battery and microSD card with a longer-lasting battery.  Other than those few things, Perfect!  Would definitely buy again!"
0,Works as well as can be expected.
1,"Pretty sturdy, I'd buy it again!"
1,My daughter received her tablet case quickly and she absolutely loves it!
1,AS advertised
0,Does not stick well.
1,"Works OK.  The main reason I selected this model is the &#34;Locator&#34; feature it has.  The volume is too low to be heard from more than a couple of feet away.  If I am that close I can probably see the headset!  Will not always connect to my phone, requires turning the headset off/on a couple of times.  Not the quality and reliability I have come to expect from Plantronics.  This is my 3rd Plantronics bluetooth headset, may be my last!!"
-1,Chipped and broke in the bottom right corner after barely dropping my phone.
1,"Good product, highly recommended"
1,Nice
1,So far we like this watch however it did take some time trying to get it fully working with our phones
-1,Fairly disappointed. It does not seat properly in the outlet.  Some times it charges and then sometimes falls slightly loose and stops charging.  I have played with it but it just does not seem to be designed properly. Hope I can still return it.
1,It works as its supposed to but will disconnect randomly.  update : the company saw my review and sent me a new one for free. new product does not have any issues.
-1,Bought this for an iPhone 6 after reading great reviews. First time the phone was dropped (about 3 feet onto tile) the screen shattered. Otterboxes seem to protect our phones much better
1,Useful
1,Best I've been using it for days
1,ok
1,It very good thanks
1,Excellent quality product for price that should outlast other synthetic products three times.
-1,I had one before and got a new one one week after i got it the end broke half way off on the bottom were the legs slide in
-1,"The cord stopped charging my phone after about 2 months of use. I was super bummed because it's held up really well except for the fact that it doesn't charge my iPhone 6 anymore. I've tried it all- different wall blocks, taking the bottom of my case off, using it with my laptop..nothing works about it anymore."
1,Great
1,Loved it soo much I bought another one when my other one broke. Looks great with the gold iPhone. Lots of compliments
1,"Phone/batteries still gets hot, but that isn't the batteries fault. However, these replacements are working well even in the heat."
1,"No problem at all with this charger.  I needed something easily packable and light and powerful, and this fit the bill for a recent trip."
1,this was awesome!!!!! Will get another when I need one.  Well worth it.
1,"I bought this to use for the connection between my iPad Mini 2 and my Phantom 3 Professional. This cable is a perfect solution. It is just the right length. Short enough that there is no extra cord dangling around, but long enough to be able to easily connect with a sunshade on the iPad. I bought a different short cable. It created HORRIBLE pixelation of the FPV. This cable provides FPV just as perfect as the way too long Apple cable . This is definitely a must have addition for the P3. Stop looking and buy it."
-1,"The charging range seemed very small, and I had to be picky enough about placing it that it would've been just as easy to plug in a USB cable.  The plug is also very fragile and eventually broke off of mine, right before I would've decided to take it out anyway.  I'd recommend waiting until the new charging standards come out."
1,"This is a great charger….does the job in good speed, does not get hot and charges 4 devices as advertised.  Glad I purchased!"
1,So far so good. I really like the fitness phone holder. My iPhone 5S fit well in it and it was easy to put on my arm. The material kept my phone from getting damp. It arrived quickly.
1,Just as advertised.
1,"I have had ZERO problems, I have a Samsung Tab 10.1 s3, a Samsung s3 4GLTE handset, a Samsung flip phone CDMA style, a pebble wearable, and Bluetooth Bose speaker hooked up with all the correct Ufone cords.  must be the Apple... I really don't know and don't care for their style or equipment but getting Ufone intelligent cords sure does help."
-1,I bought this thinking that I could replace all of my chargers by my bedside with this but guess what? 1 of the ports died.<br />So disappointed. Wouldn't recommend buying.<br />Spent my money and time researching this product for nothing.<br />They should've made better products if they want to survive.
1,I like it but it could fit on a lil tighter. Overall very happy with it.
1,Great product
1,Fit and looked great
1,"This case is awesome! I drop my phone all the time and it protects it very well. I also like the fact that I do not have to carry around my large purse anymore. My id and two other cards fit perfectly in it. I've also been able to squeeze in money as well although its not even when you do so. Overall, I'm very happy with my buy and would buy it again!"
1,"Slim but very protective, great for a large phone that you don't want to be GIGANTIC with a protective case"
1,As advertised.
1,Still having trouble snapping it together.
1,"Great product and easy instruction, crystal clear screen"
1,Works great considering I have the galaxy S6 curve. The curved screen presents a problem for most cases. I tried 3 other cases before this one.
1,"Just as discribed. Fast shipping, just what I needed."
1,Case was just as pictured. Came very quickly even delivered on a Sunday!
1,Meet or exceeded as advertise
1,"Pretty much as advertised.  Nice cover, but would really rather have one that is less bulky.  Doesn't need place for cards, just protect the phone from pocket dials, etc."
1,Very good
1,Good
1,a
1,Extremely quick shipping. Product is as advertised. Strange thing...shipping information still says this product is still in route to be delivered on future date. Product is definitely a good buy in every aspect. Thanks!
1,It's already paid for itself. My phone survived a nasty fall without so much as a scratch. The case is easy to grip and adds little bulk o the overall phone. Plus it looks awesome.
1,amazing - love it - i never speed - my 88 year old mother tells me I am a hazard because I drive too slow. I like knowing where the &#34;hot spots&#34; are. Great value!
1,My daughter loves it! I love it cause it durable and fits great on her phone.
-1,Went out within a month.
1,Convenient. Does its job.
0,Only lasts a few months and then frays at the lightning end.
1,Feels the same as an otterbox. Great quality and protection.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for a review.
1,"This cable is great!  It's even better quality than I was expecting, and it's clearly going to hold up for a long time."
1,"I've not yet tested the answer phone/hang up phone buttons, but this thing is definitely well worth the money you spend on it if you plan on using it to listen to music from your phone/.mp3 player over your car radio. This being said, make sure your device is Bluetooth enabled. iPhones, iPod Touch, and most smart phones/devices do.<br /><br />It's very easy to install. You just plug it into your cigarette lighter, turn it on, set the FM station you want your music to play over, tune your radio into said station, and lastly pair the device you're going to play music on with the FM transmitter (turn on Bluetooth and select &#34;BC-06&#34; from the list of available devices).<br /><br />It sounds more complicated than it really is. It's very easy as long as you have a basic understanding of enabling and pairing with Bluetooth devices on your music device. Comes with an instruction booklet.<br /><br />As far as quality goes, I can hear a bit of static between songs, but as the song plays, it's exceedingly clear. Try a different FM frequency if you have issues with static. It beats listening to the radio in my area and cassettes, no doubt.<br /><br />It's quite easy to switch songs using the side buttons, and the additional USB ports are definitely sweet.<br /><br />It's possible that there are more expensive products out there that would do better. This is the first one I've personally tried. But again, for what you're paying for it, I doubt you'll be disappointed. I know I've used it pretty much every time I get in my truck."
-1,"I did receive item in a timely fashion, but when I went to check connections for the third time with correct wiring, it didn't even turn on. I hear great reviews about it... I guess im just one of the few..."
1,"I like this because it does not show fingerprints easily.  I bought a different one before this, but didn't like it at all.  This one is high quality."
1,Pairing was a little tricky but it seems to work very well now. Very important for us here in NH since hands free is the law.
1,These work great and are super cheap.
1,Love it! It works great.
1,these speakers replaced the outside speakers on my weekend warrior toy hauler.
1,Nice screen for replacement. Nice packing and extra tools. Working great.
-1,It did not fit my 96 S10 as advertised but the return was painless. Extra star for that.
1,Very pleased
-1,"This got stuck in the sim card slot on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and the slot broke while trying to get it out, basically making my phone useless. Luckily I managed to order a replacement sim/sd card slot and fix it myself (only losing the back and options key in the process), but most mobile repair shops would not even attempt the repair and others charged more than the value of the phone for it.<br /><br />Save your phones and don't buy this."
1,"The case is tailor made for the Bose SoundLink Mini.  The speaker fits snugly into the main compartment.  The charging base, wall plug, and charging cord fit snugly into the top compartment.  Nothing moves when the case is zippered; all is stable.  The case is well constructed for the purpose it serves: keep all parts of the Bose system together and protected from mild impacts and sharps damage.  If there have been tests for severe impacts such as dropping from a height of several feet, I am unaware of the results.  The case has hard walls surrounding the unit which should protect from sharp and blunt impacts, but there is no real padding to insulate the speaker unit from vibrational damage associated with being dropped or thrown off a rack or shelf.  The zipper is good quality and I like the colorful and interesting &#34;Khanka&#34; metal zipper pull.  The small strap and its attachment loop are OK for the empty case but don't seem durable enough to carry the the weight of the speaker.  This is the main area for improvement that I would advise.<br /><br />On the other hand....the Khanka EVA hard case is a good looking, space efficient, well constructed, easy to use and lightweight case. The price is excellent for the features and protection provided:  I highly recommend it.  Let your backpack or suitcase do the rest!"
1,"Talk about a &#34;Shining Star&#34;!  The photographs don't do it justice!  It is like a beautiful piece of jewelry that accessorizes my hand when I use my phone!  I love, love, love it! ~♡~"
0,"Good protection and excellent feeling in the hand. I really liked the product and would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the AUX cable. It does not fit when I have the case one, so to use my headphones or hear music in the car I have to remove the case which is really inconvenient for me."
-1,Hard to get to work. Sent back!
-1,Came damage didn't even get the chance to use!
1,"Very well built case that hardly adds any bulk to the MotoX. Almost feels like it isn't there, and it has also protected the phone from a few small falls."
-1,To big.  Don't like it.
1,This cover is such a great color.. too bad that it's not the same as the waterproof back that comes on the phone originally... I have to make sure my phone doesn't get wet with this back cover on. Still does everything it's supposed to
1,"Does exactly what it's suppose to, protect my screen"
1,"I have about three different cases for my G2, this is by far the best one."
-1,"Having upgraded from a Blu Dash 3.5, I was disappointing in the quality of this product.<br /><br />The camera's quality is that of some first generation digital camera.  This phone's camera is not even as good as the years old one I upgraded from.  The power connection is off kilter resulting in having to place the cable in on a forward angle and pressing backwards before pushing it in.  Even when pushed in, you have to make look carefully to ensure it's actually charging.  The sound quality from the headphones is just poor, low volume and a slight tinny sound it it.  Even using my own quality earbuds, the audio quality just isn't there.  The power on button is recessed a bit too far back into the case making difficult for all but petite fingers to use.  I have opened the case and wiggled it when closing in hopes that its just a misaligned board to case, but it appears the assembled parts are made this way.<br /><br />As a smartphone, it has all the features and systems in place that one needs.  It is, however, an introductory product for someone who just isn't into the need for quality images and audio, this is great for the price.  It seems a little ironic that a product with the name &#34;Studio&#34; in it failed at studio items.  The Blu Dash series from several years ago still out performed the &#34;studio&#34; aspect (sound and images) of this product.  Hopefully I just got the one inferior quality item and my results are not what other's will have."
-1,"This was the last commercial base station antenna that I'll buy. The assembly instructions are not great, but tolerable. My biggest problem, though is the claim that no tuning or adjustment is necessary. Bulls***! My antenna, fully assembled and tested at least 10 feet away from anything, including the ground, showed a 2:1 bandwidth from about 144.5 MHz to about 147.5 MHz. Not enough to cover even the FM portion of 2m. On 440, the situation is even worse. Resonance lands at about 435 MHz and the 2:1 mark is passed at about 438 MHz. In the transmit portion of the FM repeater section of the band, it's already over 3:1, so unusable on that band, and far from what is claimed.    Today, I built a \\""flower pot\\"" vertical dual band antenna from about $10 worth of parts, and it outshines this piece of crap by a landslide in terms of both usable bandwidth and on-air performance. I'm going to give this Tram to my dad and let him see if he can get it to work or use it as a mono-band antenna. I'll be homebrewing my base station antennas from now on."
-1,DO NOT BUY. WISH THERE WERE A NO STAR RATING BECAUSE THATS WHAT THIS CASE DESERVES. my phone fell out of my hand. on to its back didn't bounce just flat on its back. considering this case is only on the back I would think it would protect it. well I look down and my phone is shattered glass all over the floor. I can nearly see what I'm type on its so badly cracked. air under the screen glass missing and a bad case on my phone.  couldn't get worse.
0,"has too much static to use for very long, if at all. i received this item in exchange for a review."
1,PERFECT!!  Fits iphone 6 plus and more. Streamline design and super cute!
1,"This Galaxy Note 5 case by i-Blason is great.  It is heavy duty, rugged, and durable.  It comes with a belt clip/holster that is secure and swivels.  The black color is perfect for guys like me.  It is very easy to put the phone in the case and it fits like a glove.  I have had it on since it came to me and I even put the screen protector on after I put this case on.  The ports for charging and headpphones are easy to access as is the S-pen.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
1,Woks well
1,Have not melted like the other one I had. Have a 150 amp and a 60 amp fuse in it. 0 gauge in and two 4 gauge out.
1,Great product..
-1,Terrible quality
1,"These are exactly the same as they are described, my only complaint is the little rubber tips. Don't seem to last long before they go flat. Atleast you do get 9 of them! Lol"
-1,It got here a lot earlier than expected and it's super cute. But my phone wiggles around in the case it doesn't fit well at all.
1,it arrived quickly and it's gorgeous. i love that i don't have to carry a separate wallet. it's well made and i love the color.
1,Fast shipping and great price! Thanks.
-1,The batteries would not fit into the cell phone. They were about 1 to 2 mm longer than the original. I am trying to return it to the sender
0,"This case is &#34;just ok&#34;. I thought it would be nicer, but for 6.00 it's just ok. Not too cheap, but nothing to brag about either."
1,Wonderful product. Been looking for one for months but everything was too pricey. This is perfect and fits my watch and iPhone 6 plus wonderfully!!!!
1,AWESOME case! Really protects the phone and shows the aesthetics of the design of my 6 plus.
1,"Simple, cheap, functional and even stylish. Great gadget for the smart phone user. Getting one of the larger phones (I have an iPhone 5 in a Lifecase) into the stretched web of silicone is a little tricky if you have limited handlebar real estate but once it is secured, it is SECURE. Recommended product."
1,good so far
-1,DOES NOT FIT XPERIA Z3 COMPACT. The phone is TOO THICK to fit into the slot. It looks like you can remove the slot and replace it with a wider one. BUT THE WIDER ONE IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR Z3 COMPACT. And heck if I can figure out how to change the slot adapters anyway! Comes with no directions!
-1,Don't waste your money. Had this screen protector for less than 2 weeks and dropped my phone and iPhone screen cracked.
1,does the job
1,Love it!
1,"I had expected the case to be flexible and the glitter to flow more easily, needed slightly less fine powder, ok.  Hadn't realized the time frame for the send"
1,Good case
1,"I hooked theses up to a old MTX thunder 250 amp. They sound awesome! Clean, clear sound. Would have given 5 but I wish they had more bass. Great for the money."
-1,"wont stay closed, you get what you pay for"
1,Exactly what I wanted and the price is great.
1,this is a great device but for some reason it keeps disconnecting from my phone. the ear pieces are a bit uncomfortable but it might just needs to be broke in.
1,As advertised.
-1,"I was curious to see how efficient the solar charging element would be so I first drained the storage by recharging my smart phone several times, which it did nicely. Then I placed the charger in direct summertime sunshine during cloudless days in San Diego. Even after two full days it was not charged. I returned it for a refund and ordered one without the solar element."
-1,was not white it came in Safire blue/bk it was a gift for someone but the person kept it unsatisfied  not good
1,"I love the convenience of not having to unplug my phone anytime I need to use it, but the charging is much slower than with a cord and sometimes if it's not settled properly, it won't be charging at all.<br />Still, though, wireless charging is great."
1,"It is amazing and very helpful,, i never had any problem with it and i like that it is small so i can always keep it with me in my handbag.."
-1,"Worked for the 1st month and 1/2 and slowly the cable would stop charging my phone.I thought it was my phone so i ended up exchanging my phone because i thought it was defected. Now, its been 3 months after and they stopped working. Now the Error say this accessory doesn't work for iphone6 that i have. But now i cant even Return or exchange them because of the 30day policy.. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!"
-1,Sucks!!!! Didn't fit my tab like it says it would..
1,It powers two iPhone 6's or an iPhone + iPad on road trips w/no issues.  We have three and none have had issues.
1,"Fast and easy to install with no bubble,it was so clear. I would buy another one once needed."
1,"This is my first time buying a portable phone charger. I bought this based off of the reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />I haven't had any troubles with this device. I received it the next day after wording (something that has never happened...maybe two days later, but never the NEXT day). It came in a neat little box, complete with the device, a small cord, a dust jacket, and the instructions. I will say that the instructions are crap, hence the 4 stars (I would give it 4.5 stars). I love pictures as much as the next person, but it gave me the bare minimum on how to operate the charger. To save anyone the same confusion, here is what I know:<br /><br />- Charge the device before you officially use it in public. You hook the smaller end of the cord into the device and the larger, USB side into your iPhone wall charger. You will see an orange glow from the device - that means it's charging. The glow will disappear once charging is complete.<br />- If you do not have an android, the provided cord will not work for your iPhone. Use your phone charger cord to connect the device to your phone. Once connected, press the small button (where you originally saw the orange light) to begin charging your phone. It will turn green.<br /><br />Ok, that is out of the way. The charger itself has some weight to it, but it's still light enough to carry around. It fully charges my phone with no issues. I've recently taken it with me on a plane in my personal bag. It fits in my book bag and small purse. Overall, it is a nice, sleek, and useful little gadget."
1,Supercute.  Love it.  No jewels have fallen off and I have had this for months.
1,No problem--arrived when stated
0,"Very minimal cover.  I really like the color; however, the cover got discolored from use."
0,It wasn't the same color as shown in the picture. I wanted red and the case I got was more of a red orange.
1,I bought this for my dad..he loves it and the color. What a great buy for the work he does!
1,"It was arrived fast, but my only concern was the size of them... the corners did not stick properly, so I had to even cut them slightly to fit my screen. Still corners are not stick, maybe I have different tablet I do not know."
1,Very impressed with this phone case!
-1,All I was was a black case and a sticker on it
1,"I like this item I purchased two, one for me and another for my sister but she did not like her it was too thick for her taste however I love it and I am using it all the time."
1,My daughter is very happy with this product. She has taken underwater pics several times with no problems.
1,Very durable cable I would definitely buy again.
1,Cant wait for my phone case to come
1,Love that it has a front piece and not just the back. My phone feels safe having the rubber internal cover and feels good to hold.
0,The clips break off easily.  Otherwise they are okay but not great.  You get what you pay for.
1,"A metal stand sized for larger cell phones and tablets.<br /><br />The sturdy aluminum construction has Apple's aesthetic and will look at home in a modern workspace. Having the phone standing up lets you check for updates without picking up the phone (especially with wave-to-wake devices like the Moto X), or maintain the correct angle for photo/video (eg, Facetime). For visually-cued people like me, it also provides a convenient \\""everything in its place\\"" spot for my phone.<br /><br />[ A free sample was provided to me for review. ]<br /><br />The stand's display angle is adjustable, and it locks firmly in place (except when the hinge button is pressed). There are rubber bumpers on the angled part of stand and on the bottom to keep things in place. The stand doesn't display and branding.<br /><br />It's a good fit for my LG Nexus5, where I prefer the phone in the horizontal orientation. For phones under 5\\"", I'd worry the metal of the stand would interfere with the wireless signals (ie, when the stand overlaps the edge of the phone to any major extent). For those of you with larger phones or tablets, this stand is Recommended."
1,"So original, so cool, i love it!"
1,Really cute!
1,"Great seller!! Arrived fast, love that it feels soft and not bulky but already dropped phone twice and this case has proven worthy. Gonna buy more in different colors for friends who love mine."
1,Great!
1,great
-1,"The USB charging port cutout on the bottom wasn't large enough. I couldn't get the factory charge cable nor my Amazon Essentials cable to flushly connect. If i held it in by hand it would charge, but as soon as I let go the cable popped out. I had to cut off the bottom front trim where the port cutoff is. The cables then fit fine.<br /><br />Also the gold plastic trim is free floating. Paper money tends to get stuck in it when its in my pocket."
1,It was great
1,It was awesome!!! Worked for my Apple Tv
1,"Not a bad product,  I love the fact that it can just be worn as a accessory, and if not just clipped to bag straps.  Charge time is fairly good,  gets a little warm when charging though. lives up to the 3000mah capacity. The way it's designed however has one minor flaw in that if you wear it,  the area around the port cover kind of bends to conform with the wrist and creates little spaces where water might get into.<br />Overall still love  the product.  Would definitely be recommending it."
1,Sometimes picks up other things... Otherwise cool and nice to have.
1,"I've been using this case for the past 4 months. It hasn't been off the phone for more than a few minutes since I've got it. I love the card holder feature. I no longer carry a wallet with me, which is great. It holds my driver's license and debit card perfectly and the door opens and closes easily but only when I want it to. Haven't  had any issues with it opening unexpectedly or loosing my cards. I do construction so this case takes more than typical abuse and has stood up to it well. It does make the phone a little bulky but still better than carrying a wallet and a phone."
1,Bought a couple of these two or three years ago to replace original in-the-car video headsets. Work as well as OEM and much less expensive. Gradually grand kids have out numbered the headsets so we had to get more. Also work well with my TV sound wireless transmitter.
1,Great
1,Very handy
-1,"Purchased in January of 2014, and was used on my bike indoors once in awhile. Recently I decided to get serious about exercise, and started riding a lot more often. Starting in July 2015, I used the holder one hour a week indoors, and two hours a week outdoors on the actual road. On 8/30/15, I was riding and the entire unit along with my Galaxy Note 3 phone flew off the bike onto the road. Luckily it wasn't busy and I was able to retrieve my phone with no damage to it. When I investigated it, I noticed that the shaft of the mount that connects to holder to the handlebar had broken off!<br /><br />I took two photos, and have attached them to this review.<br /><br />If you do decide to purchase this item, be sure to use the stretch cord provided, in case the unit falls off. It's a good idea anyway, when using it on the road, because the vibrations on the road can cause your phone to come out, especially if you ride over a bump or hit a rough patch of pavement."
1,It was great
1,Cute and well made
1,As advertised.
-1,"Not happy !  Put battery in phone, charged battery, put phone on nightstand next to bed & did not even use & had to recharge less than 12 hours later. Recharged again with same result."
1,Great quality
1,So far good . if its fails after 4-5 month will let you know my dear .
1,Quick shipping and awesome product.
0,Little large
1,"Perfect! They work so well (: the one tmobile gave me broke, but now I have 2 that hopefully will last."
-1,This is so plastic that it don't even fit on my phone right
1,"These radios worked very well, the few times I needed them. Paired with a &#34;Secret Service&#34; earbud, they worked perfect for wedding videographers indoors. I never had a problem with range, because I didn't try to use them like they were a cell phone.<br /><br />I would buy these again."
1,Great product! Just as described.
-1,These are cheap Chinese junk. They will not synch with the bluetooth system on my phone. They are poorly made I would not recommend them to anyone.
1,"Gorgeous, high quality band! I love it! Lightening FAST shipping too.  Highly recommend this product."
1,Great item
1,"Good quality item. Reliable, great sound for the price"
-1,Batteries didn't last very long and only worked when it wanted to. I don't recommend this product.
-1,"The cover image is too dark, and is bad quality material.<br /><br />Ps. The face of link is cut."
1,They do a good job  !😀
1,Easy to apply. Does what it is supposed to do.
1,"I have now purchased 4 of these units , they are amazing and truly a life saver in places that have limited power outlets . GREAT PRODUCT !"
1,I love it!!!! Soo smooth
-1,I got these for my husband for a Christmas gift and they stopped working in less than a month.  And I didn't get a 100% refund for a broken item but had to have a &#34;restocking&#34; fee taken out of the price!
-1,Battery did not work. Would not take charge after waiting almost 4 weeks for it. Very disappointing.
1,Love this holder! Looks nice and works great. Thanks!
1,I mlove this case thank you!
1,love it
1,Very good for the price....I highly recommend this produce
1,Fantastic! Fits phone great and looks good!
-1,"No.....They are exactually every bit of what you paid for.. Just don't press the fake volume to many times, and don't drop them at all."
-1,"Not unlocked. Bought it for my son, so it was a while before he completed enough for me to look into the issue. T-Mobile can not send text messages with pictures. They say &#34;downloading&#34; but never do. No Internet either. I called tmobile AND HTC. After those conversations, they said the phone was unlocked incorrectly causing them to not be able to correct the issue. Sansung has awesome low end devices now, so I just went to the tmobile store instead. A deal is rarely a deal, now a days."
1,Product comes with really good instructions which I loved! We attached the cover to my son's iPhone 6 it was a little challenging but eventually we got in on the phone. It took about 30 minutes to apply. We did have a few little bubbles that we could not get rid of but after a few times of removing and putting the cover on we were able to leave only a few little ones and after a day they are all gone and now you can't even tell that a cover is on the phone! Which my son loves. We have tried plenty of phone covers this is definitely the best one yet!<br /><br />I received this product in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.
1,Great case so beautiful
1,Great low profile case
1,"Easiest and best installation ever.  Looks fantastic.  Beware, it can crack but worth it if you don't expect these to last more than a few months."
0,But backside has no roughness to prevent slippage from smooth surfaces<br />Now looking for either a replacement or a cover that is more non slip
1,"Excellent idea to add in different lenses to your iPhone 6. The frame is easy to connect (although the case needs to be removed for ours), and the lenses go on quickly and easy. This could really increase your enjoyment of the iPhone's superb camera features."
1,Great stylus . I bought this one as a back up for one I already have had for a couple years.
1,Good product.  Goes on easy
1,"Bought this for my husband.  He loves it. He carries his credit card, license, and some cash in it and carries it on his hip.  Great product because he has lost his wallet twice."
1,Exactly what I wanted
1,For the price the armband is a great buy. I find it annoying with the headphone cord but that is to be expected. I leave my phone case on and it fits but it's hard to change songs.
0,"I tried to use this on multiple objects in my room, and I ended up having it sit on my side dresser for awhile after being disappointed. Kind of thick, so if you have an outlet behind something against the wall, be prepared not to use it there or to have it sticking out a good amount. For some reason, some of things I tried to use this on was hard to plug into. Bad planning on my part and even stupidity, but for some reason didnt expect this to be 3 prongs. After having to do some cleaning and moving around, I was able to set this up to my main bedroom light.<br /><br />Setup was a little wonky at first, but it was pretty easy and painless in the long run. Thought I read somewhere that you could walk into room with this, and it would pick up your phone and turn the light on for you. Didn't see this option in setting unfortunately. Man am I satisfied though! There was some disappointed with the setup of things, expectations, and settings.. but overall I would recommend this. So far one of the cheapest routes for this type of thing for lights, and one of the few at this time that work with Amazon Echo. Love it with my Alexa!"
1,Fits better that my lifeproof
-1,"The Wildtek REPEL Waterproof iPhone 6 Case was packaged nicely, with a microfiber cloth, a wrist band, and clear instructions on how to test for waterproofness and case assembly. Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to test the case, as when I observed it closely out of the box, I noticed that one side had a slight &#34;bowing&#34; (see attached photo), thereby not making a true seal when the two halves were snapped together around my iPhone 6. In addition, the tactile feel of the plastic was a bit too smooth, and overall, didn't exude the Quality as I had hoped.  A noble effort that fell a bit short on Quality control."
-1,Product simply does not work! Bought for my wife and the velcro closure will not stay shut. She cant even use it!
1,Can't tell the difference
1,Good value to prevent opening otter box to get at jack
1,Battery was fine.  Did not fix my phone
1,"I've used this on a golf cart now for four different outings. It is the best holder I've found for my iPhone and I use the iPhone app while golfing so I need to be able to see it and know it is secure. The grip on the plastic windshield is exceptional. It easily detaches to apply to another golf cart if necessary. It grips the phone is such a way that you know it won't come loose. I use it both on the road, on the cart paths and on the fairways and rough. It is simple and inexpensive. You can't go wrong."
1,Love this. It keeps me moving. If I have been sitting to long it will remind me. I can keep track of my walking with this.
0,"Decent quality, didn't use it much Because i felt like a drop would of destroy My phone. Bumpers scratched up bad"
1,"I love it just as good as the OtterBox defender , which cost so much.....I got the generic one so cheap⭐️"
1,"Very good product, easy to place on phone"
1,Excellent case.<br /><br />Has survived many drops with no damage to the phone at all.<br /><br />Diztronic always has great products.
1,Perfect picture perfect quality
1,Super easy to do.  Knocked it out in 10 minutes.
1,"Bought mine about 18 months ago for about $90 on sale at Verizon.  Use it every day, not to power my iPhone 5S which is always charged with other chargers, but it gives one full charge to my iPad Mini.  It takes an overnight charge to get to four ****, but then fills up the iPad Mini beautifully.  Have recharged it countless times, still is reliable and compact.  There is newer and faster technology out there now, but I've been very satisfied with this powerstation duo..."
1,Very good
1,Exactly what I expected
1,"covered, protected, clear sheet of plastic , if installed correctly works great i personally upgraded to ballistic glass the installation wasn't as tedious but its far more expensive."
1,ok
1,"Very pleased and would reccomend, but dots fade somewhat over time. Many other of my bands have broken, but this one has held up. There was a slight misprint where the dots were printed on the side window area, but are barely noticeable."
-1,Useless piece of junk why does sound come out of the watch?
-1,"It has many isses with languag, and masseges sice it loses the contacts between numbers and messages."
-1,This Privacy screen guard caused a significant rainbow effect when viewing the screen.  The privacy feature on this had at least a 120 degree viewing angle which is far more than in the product description.  I only kept it on my phone until a different screen protector arrived.
1,4 stars because it cracked while I was trying to get the air bubbles out with the included tool. Good customer service; one e-mail and a replacement was on the way to me. Hopefully the new one will last longer.
1,As advertised.
1,Decent quality sound.  Decent range device to headphones.  Comfortable to wear. Easy pairing with phone and computer.  And all at an affordable price!
0,It works great with all 4-5 inch phone but little difficult for iPhone 6+ kind of phones specially with cover
-1,It was great to have a long plug in but it broke right near the iPad plug in after a couple weeks.
1,"My car has a little side window next to the windshield where I like to mount my GPS. However, the mount from Garmin does not even have an extension arm. If I mount it on the windshield, the GPS is either too far away or I need to put it above my head. I got this arm and now I can mount it on the side window again. The suction is better than my old GPS mount that kept falling off in winter time (it is very cold here in winter). This one stick well through out the seasons. The only issue is the vibration of GPS sometimes due to the long arm."
1,Love my case shipping took to long
1,"Love the Qualcomm technology.  The ONLY reason I'm knocking it one star is because it doesn't clearly state that it doesn't come with a cable (or, I'm just that dumb and did't see it) but it is great to have the ability to quick-charge my phone in house and now in car.  I'm using an old Motorola cable and it has no issues.  My Samsung Galaxy Note 4 charges in less than an hour.  So handy if you are on your phone a lot."
-1,"Had a rough edge out of package. Didnt think anything of it, except the edge developed a chip and has now turned into a hairline crack. I didnt even have a chance to drop it as Ive only had it two weeks."
-1,not as good as described.
1,Very durable
1,Good quality and excellent cost.
1,Fast shipping no damage.
0,Did not last long.
-1,it broke already on the first day. good thing it was free :)
1,When you spend as much we do on phones now days you want your phone to be protected.  This glass screen protector is awesome at protecting our Note 4.  It fits the phone well and so much better than plastic screen protectors.  The glass doesn’t take any of the sensitivity away from the phone like some protectors do and is scratch resistant.<br /><br />Installation was a breeze.  First was to make sure the phones screen was very clean and free of any dust and hair.  Then we placed the screen on the phone and it pretty much attached itself without us having to do anything.  We could actually see the air bubbles moving to the sides of the screen protector and disappearing.  This was so easy for us because we once learned a trick of doing the glass screen protectors in a steamy bathroom.  The steam weighs all the floating particles down so they are no longer floating in the air to land on the screen.  The moisture also helps the glass to adhere to the phones glass without using a card to get the bubbles out.  This method is amazing.<br /><br />I have received this product in exchange for an honest review.
-1,It came broken was very upset
1,Great case
-1,Broke within the first week😤
1,Very good
1,a
1,easy to set up and works wonderful
1,Great. I wish there were other colors.
1,Easy to apply. No air bubbles at all.  Edges not quite covered but still should give great protection
1,"Wow.  Just wow.  I put PigflyTech's Google Cardboard together as soon as it was delivered.  (Advice: follow the instructions on the Cardboard itself, the included instruction sheet is a little convoluted.)<br /><br />After ordering this I went ahead and dowbloaded a number of Cardboard VR apps from Google Play for my Samsung S5. Wanted to be abke to just start using it right away.<br /><br />The QR code on the Cardboard comes up as  unrecognized by the official Google Carboard app when setting up the app.  That is fine, jt just sets this up as the default viewer.  The app that thw Android QR reader brings up looks like the official app but in an Eastern language.  Still, can use the offical and so many others.<br /><br />This is a lot of fun, PigflyTech.  Basic VR done right.  Love the actual cardboard construction and the metal ring on the left side that works as a switch/button in conjunction with the magnet on the inside.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Please include a head strap with this, that almost made me give Cardboard four stars instead of five.  This is great stuff, it would be fantastic if I didnt have to hold it with my hands to use it.<br /><br />This feeds the geekgirl in me.  Having a great time with it in the Insidious 3 and Virtual Tour apps.<br /><br />Came back and upped it to a 5 star rating. The lack of a head strap just isnt  enough to lose one star.  Still having fun with this!"
1,As advertised.
1,Just got as a &#34;just under casr&#34; part in case the one on by Samsung Galaxy S5 should  break.  Price was excellent and shipment arrive in great condition.
1,"Very nice case , good quality , Looks exactly like the picture , and fits my galaxy s6 edge plus perfectly 😍"
1,Works as described. I use it around the house and not actually while travel. My battery pack that plugs directly in the wall and has built-in cable is better suited for travel.
1,"Yes, thank you"
1,Great product! Just as described.
0,Makes a ringing noise when I talk to someone. But it's good all together
1,Good
1,Love this phone case its very good leather the stlus has lasted a very long time i highly recommended this phone case!😃
-1,Very little adjustment  broke very easy
-1,Received the wrong color and the hard shell fell apart when removing it
1,It is a nice case.
1,"This thing JUST WORKS!  As advertised, no issues.  You take a hit on audio quality switching to BlueTooth as opposed to a wired aux jack, but it's very convenient.  A couple things they don't tell you in the information for this is that it was easy for me to route my phone audio to my car's existing BlueTooth phone equipment and route my music audio to this at the same time.  Also, you can charge it while using it.  It says the battery lasts 10 hours on a full charge (and it takes less than 1.5 hours to charge it completely) but I have definitely used it for more than 10 hours on the same charge and decided to try charging while I drove for a day.  It managed to charge completely while being used.  That's a great feature!"
1,"I've had this iPhone cover for about a month and a half now.  Love it!  Love the scripture, the colors, the design!"
-1,I didn't get a Bluetooth remote to take a picture with my selfie stick. So now I just have a selfie stick but no way to take the picture.
1,very cute but would be better if held more cards
1,Great case..  Although I was expecting the feel of a tape and not just a picture..  But I gave it to my coworker and she loves it
-1,Would like a refund
-1,felt cheap plastic
1,OK.
-1,Do not buy this. The charger does not stay in the jack and the swivel arm falls down constantly. This is a horrible product.
1,Its great!
1,Hey it wrks
1,A must have! Worth the money. Great power reserve.
1,My phone case is perfect and arrived on time. GREAT product.
1,"I bought this case as a gift for my mom's new iPhone. She loved the color and the matte feel of the case. It seems to protect her phone very well and has a nice lip around the edge that protects it in a fall. I liked it so much, I purchased myself one in white."
1,I've had this Tuff case for a week now and Love it. It comes in different color variations which is nice. Seems sturdy. Good grip. And I like how the corners don't have the hard gel case. IMO less likely to break as fast.
1,Nothing more than a fantastic case.
1,Great to have these extras around.
1,I expected more coverage on the top and bottom.
-1,I have not figured out why it falls off the dashboard while I drive. Perhaps someone out there knows?
1,Works great!  I'm using it with an iPhone 6 and Nexus 6 along with Nokia HERE and Gaia maps.
-1,This case is really ONLY A BUMPER. Found it completely useless.
1,I bought it for my teen daughter. It fit great and has survived many drops on many different surfaces!
1,Great product
1,Excellent battery case.
-1,I would give this zero stars... it broke super fast...not happy with this product.
-1,"CONS:<br />The reason I love HTC is for the camera.  This cover does not protect the camera, and camera started getting scratched in my purse in the odd times I used the Dot View.  I love SPECK cases and the quality of this cover is nothing like SPECK"
1,"Great case, very durable and covers the entire phone. A little difficult to take off but putting it on is significantly easier. Would definitely recommend!"
-1,"I got the wrong one on the mail, i got one for the iphone 4.!"
-1,Did not work.
0,Love love love it........
-1,This phone is a piece of s***. It freezes often making it unusable. I used mine for about a few days now and I was so mad that I threw it against the wall.
1,This is a useful gadget well worth its low price. It is also well made and comfortable to use. My only concern is its relatively low battery charge.
-1,The cable is too short😞
1,Charges phone very fast
1,"The first unit received may have been defective so Anker's customer service replaced immediately with no hassle and it got a brand new one.  This second unit seems to be working fine.  I'm still not completely satisfied with the charging speed but, that's just my expectation and there's nothing wrong with the unit."
1,Love it! It even came with a stylus  which was  a nice surprise
-1,Doesn't come with any instructions. So you don't know when it's charged or not.
1,The Airave Version 2 Sprint Access Point was the correct item to solve the weak signal I was receiving on my Virgin mobile phone.  The item<br />was delivered on time worked perfectly.
1,Work great with my Samsung galaxy s6.
1,Excellent Product! Ordering was easy. Shipping was fast!
1,This phone case keeps my phone safe from any scratches while inside my purse SUPER easy to use and super cute. The magnet holds nice and tight. AND it holds my ID and Debit card.<br /><br />I received this product mentioned above for free.<br />This is my honest opinion and I hope it helps in you decision weather or not to purchase the above item..
1,"Great quality,love the color combo and appears to be very sturdy .<br />Most importantly , fits my Zik perfectly ."
1,"Wish I was able to use the volume and lock screen button. It def seems to be waterproof, but I'm not comfortable enough to submerge it in water."
-1,"i cant understand why it is best seller on Amazon in its category. I have tried few others as well and it is just average. In fact I am using Anker which is bit costlier but totally worth it, and looks much more crisp display and screen looks solid.<br />probably most of the reviews are because of this company's &#34;review us and get a free battery case&#34;. not sure.<br />again, my screen protector was average. not saying its bad but for people who have not tried other glass screens, you wont know the difference."
1,GOOD.
1,Excellent!!
1,Awesome.  My daughter used it on her cross-country road trip and it both performed great and was very useful.
1,love this. white gets dirty fast
1,I'll probably order more.  I have them everywhere but leave them in the car or someone else's car.  They are just fine.
1,The item worked well and I am extremely pleased with the outcome. I highly recommend this product.
1,"I use on my iPhone6, and it fits just fine. I use the air mount, which I like because it's easy to remove whenever I'm not using it."
0,"good Bluetooth connection distance.<br />NFC is not very useful. It works when first connect to a device, but it remembers the device, and next time power on, it first connects to that device and I cannot use NFC to make new connection. Since its Bluetooth range is good, it always connect to that device first.<br />I would prefer it always to connect to NFC request, this way is closer to audio cable."
1,excellent product
1,Item as advertised. Fast shipping.
-1,Junk. It won't hold the bluetooth connection continuously even with the band on your neck and the phone on your hip.
1,Trabaja exelentemente
1,"Best case ever. Had an Otter case for my previous phone and I hated it. This one is protective, light weight and easy to put on and take off. And as usually the price on Amazon was much lower than the phone company's price."
1,Great product.
1,Excellent product
1,Bought it for my 150cc Rowdy Scooter. Very loud and good sound .  Going to get it for my Harley bike in chrome.  The only daw back is the &#34;L&#34; shape mounting brackets. I had to engineer mounting brackets that would fit my scooter. The brackets were not clearly displayed on the picture used for ordering
1,Great case. It fit well and isn't a bulky as previous defender cases
1,Nice back up camera for the price
1,good case
1,Love this case!  Makes it so easy to keep my DL and debit card with me at all times without having to carry a purse everywhere. And it is made strong and durable. Would recommend it to anyone!
1,Great
1,"not a perfect fit, but its a very nice fit"
1,"First things I noticed: It's compact and of course, fold-able. It's a bit larger than my iPad Mini when folded. It has a sturdy design (securely stitched) and the panels are sewn into the panels as well. There is no need for fumbling with any cables and searching where to plug - there is a pocket that houses a USB port that is already connected. Simply plug in your cable for your device and charge.<br /><br />The instructions are clear and right on point. (My husband and I actually went back and forth on this, because he was determined that the panel needed to charge via sunlight prior to being used at all). Not at all- you just unfold and place in direct sunlight, connect your device to the output with it's original cable, and store the device in the pocket [note: when I was test-charging my tablets, I tucked them under the flap with the pocket to keep them out of the sun, directly] The 3 simple steps would make this easy for anyone.<br /><br />Testing:<br /><br />DAY ONE: My first day testing this, it was partly cloudy. I also had placed it on the rail of my deck, which I thought had a pretty clear shot of sun hitting it. I tried my iPhone first and when a cloud passed over, I lost the charge. My phone popped up a &#34;device is not compatible message&#34; so I unplugged it and plugged it back in after the clouds had passed. I didn't get much of a charge in partly-cloudy conditions, however my device maintained it's battery level.<br /><br />DAY TWO: I was happy to have mostly clear skies and full sun (just a few intermittent clouds).  I placed the panel on my kids' picnic table directly in the sun and connected my son's Samsung Galaxy Note tab to it. The battery was at 77 percent when I plugged it in, and in roughly 1 1/2 hours it was up to 89 percent. For a tablet, that is not bad at all. I also plugged my iPad in and it charged it up 5 percent in upwards of an hour - I might add it was starting to get cloudy when I got around to testing the charge on my tablet, so I'm hoping the weather will cooperate so I can get a better idea and post it here this week. (as well as my phone)<br /><br />I'm impressed with how well this device worked in cloudy conditions here in Ohio. I would definitely recommend this product to others, but I would also recommend having a back-up plan like a portable battery pack, especially if you are going on an extended trip, camping, or are uncertain of the weather conditions ahead. My children were even excited about this charger and were thrilled that it doesn't need to be 'charged'.<br /><br />*I received this product at a promotional discount for testing and evaluation purposes in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.e so I can get a better idea and post it here this week.

1,Works great looks good love eliminating blue light while charging love the Extra length of the court as well overall satisfaction this is a great product!
1,Went on great.  Bubbles were easy to remove.  The only reason I remove one star is that there's no cut out for the front camera and sensor.
1,fast shipping and good quality
1,It is very good and it came fast. So glad!
1,Works like the original my phone came with.
1,Very impressed! I received this from a giveaway. Easy to install and very pleased with the quality. Will definitely purchase the next one. Thank you!
1,Doesn't offer as much protection as I'd like.
1,Great product! Just as described.
1,Very nice.
1,easy to apply and worked well
1,"I purchased this item because it looked like another great way to consolidate my ridiculous charging needs.  We have a lot of Apple products in our home and we're always shuffling the chargers and stands.  This stand is nice because it provides an option for you to rest your iPhone as well.  Please realize that it does not charge the phone, but it will hold it.  The stand is not an actual charger either, but rather a device that holds the iWatch cable that comes with the iWatch.<br /><br /> It is designed specifically for the iWatch because the location for the charging cable is round, just as the watch charger is.  The round piece fits in the top of the stand and the cord winds down the interior of the stand (out of view).  There are grooves to fit the cord in.  It gives you the ability to shorten and lengthen it as needed.<br /><br />This is a good deal as it is 1/3 less in price than similarly designed items, but still has the solid quality.<br /><br />The bottom has decent sized non-skid pads.  I took a photo of the bottom so that you can see the size.  I find that many electronic device stands are stingy on the rubber pads, but this one has enough to hold it in place well!<br /><br />I have received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. With the intention of helping potential consumers make a more informed purchase decision. No other form of compensation took place."
1,"after three months, they are still working~"
-1,Doesn't fit on watch face. Threw them all away.
-1,"these were actually really nice the first week. then one of the rubber pieces fell out rendering the ear bud to hang lifeless because there is nothing holding it to the headset. then one of the speakers was always kinda weak but just stopped working after a few days. for the $25 i spent, I expected a little better product considering they are marketing it as older bluetooth. not used. i'm sadder now because now the other speaker is going out and these aren't a month old yet. ugh"
1,The best budget lightning cable. No era message.  I orderd 4 more😊
0,It was kind of cool looking but all the beads went Down to the bottom  and it's a very cheap plastic that broke after a couple weeks.
1,Excellent case
1,Works very well.
1,This case works well and has saved my phone plenty of times. It's durable and also looks nice. I only wish it had more of a ridge around the front to protect the phone if it lands on its face.
-1,Not happy at all the sliding pin in the back of the click holder keeps coming off
-1,"The battery came scratched and a little dented, so I didn't chance it being a defective battery. I sent it back. My battery doesn't have XXXXXXXX on it so I assumed this was not the exact same as my stock battery."
1,Absolutely awesome product for middle and high school kids....got two of my grandkids two sets each.. ..they love them and me for getting them!
1,great
1,"These adapters are great! I tried a different set of adapters also and those don't compare to these. These are better quality and a lot easier to install and swap between bands. They make the bands look integrated and apart of the watch as normal watches do. In my opinion these are the best. Note that if you are purchasing the set for a 42mm watch the largest band size to fit is 24mm, and for 38mm watches the largest is 20mm. The design if these make it easy to use with absolutely any band because of the pin size and you are able to use different pins. Other adapters force you to use their set and the connector may be too wide on others.<br /><br />I would recommend"
1,"Very easy make your phone stand,good design! The sound quaility is also good!!"
1,"When it comes to Android smartphones Samsung is dominant and it’s easy to see why. The Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge have the quality engineering and craftsmanship to go head-to-head with the iPhone 6. Samsung has gone to great lengths to pay attention to detail and provide an exceptional smartphone experience.<br /><br />The Galaxy S6 Edge is cool, but the things that make it unique just don’t impress me that much. I’d recommend just going with the regular Galaxy S6 if you’re in the market for a new Android smartphone.<br /><br />Read the full review on TechSpective.net: http://techspective.net/2015/08/30/review-samsung-galaxy-s6-galaxy-s6-edge-smartphone/"
1,"This is a really well made little device!  I got this specifically to use to hold my iphone6 plus while filming video so I've tested it on several surfaces so far and the suction is fantastic and holds really well - much better than the tri-pod I had been using which was designed for camera use.<br />As you know, the iPhone6 Plus is a heavy phone so many of the holders just can't keep the phone upright but this Osomount 360 Grip is REALLY sturdy and doesn't tip over!<br />While this is sold as a car mount,  there are MANY more applications of use possible with this such as :<br /><br />+++Attaching to a lap stand for watching movies on your phone<br />+++Sticking to a kitchen counter top to hold your phone to read recipes while you cook and<br />+++As a holder on the desktop for use with an external, bluetooth keyboard<br /><br />Those are just SOME of the uses I've discovered for this so far!<br />I was offered a promotional discount on this holder so I could try it and give my opinion  and feedback and I'm really glad I bought this!<br />It's turned out to be one of the most helpful devices I purchased in a long time!<br />Hope this was helpful info for you :)<br />Enjoy!"
1,"Good product, highly recommended"
1,great case
1,This is a nice case. I don't know if its drop safe but all together its nice and slim like i like it
1,"I love my new phone holder, I bought an old car to leave at my vacation home so the holder is a perfect enhancement...Holds my iPhone 6 plus perfect...Very happy...Thank you!"
-1,Product came with a toxic smell .I tried  washing it but the smell would not come out had to be thrown away
1,"Very,very,happy,a love,this wallet for my z30 blackberry."
1,"Easy to use, great for the gym and work. I received this product for an honest review. Charges easily and ready to go."
-1,Very poor quality. Does not stick to dashboard.
1,The pricing on this cord was so much better than any place else.  And I can count on the AmazonBasics quality.
1,"I love this case. It has all the protection for my cell that the ad said it would. I dropped it on a cement floor three days ago and it still works perfectly. When I throw the case in my purse, I use the screen cover/belt clip to protect the screen and that's great, too. Buy it, you'll love it!"
1,Excellent!!  Charges super fast!
1,I love it becuase i don't have leave my phone sitting away from me i move with it now
1,Fits great. Very durable
-1,"Does not fit the phone well, had to order another case, waste of money. It is hard to turn volume up or down, or shut ringer off"
1,Not much more to say. I love it!
1,The stand works as advertised. though be sure to make sure that when you wrap the cable around the tower part that it's extremely taught.
-1,"I used this for awhile, but within a month the band broke. The company did send me a new one when I complained, but after that I just wasn't into it anymore. It didn't feel very accurate and because the first band broke so quickly, I just wasn't into going through that again. I ended up getting a real sports watch with a real heart monitor and ramped up my workouts that way. I'd go with a fitbit or something more substantial if I decided to go this route again."
1,Works great w a bamboo charging station.
1,"Good tracker. Like the steps, the sleep, and the tips. Not impressed with the food tracker, not easy to use. Had weight watchers tracker, hoped to use this instead.  So far it's been disappointing in that aspect."
-1,"Terrible. I am writing this review from an iPhone 4, since the video to do the replacement on my iPhone 6 was so vague. Don't attempt to do this yourself. Spend the extra money to have it done by someone who knows what they are doing."
-1,"This phone case has been a disappointment, 3days after I receive  it the stones came off,the two large on top,also the stones around it as tarter to snag my close. So, I am so disappointed, never experience this before with none of my products I have purchase."
1,Absolutely love it!!  It arrived in a timely manner and works as advertised
1,Purchased for co-worker.  They were very pleased with case.
0,It fits ok. But the only problem is that it has some sharp edges when it's on and its lifting up my screen cover. I don't know if in gonna use it.
0,"Protects my phone from fingerprints, dust, etc but after two drops, the screen protector has scratched and has begun to crack. I believe after one more drop, it will be useless and I will need to buy a new one. It's been only a month since purchasing the protector.<br /><br />On my iPhone 5, I had the same protector for 2 years and an insane amount of drops. it never had this problem.."
1,Excellent
-1,Will not hold the charge just as bad as the old battery.
0,Pro: super cute .<br />Con: cheap & rhinestones easily fall out .
1,"Fits great and is a moderate protection for the phone, it came with a screen protector but I was accidentally sent a screen protector for an iPhone 4 not for the 6."
1,This is my 2nd elago case because I like the design and cute colors available.
1,Fits
1,"Second Spigen cover I've used on my phones and I must say I'm impressed by how sleek and durable these cases can be! This cover in particular is even slimmer than the previous case I had on my Galaxy S5, but it feels just as sturdy. The included stand is a nice feature, looks a tiny bit flimsy so I don't think I'll be messing around with it much. Overall great product and excellent service from Spigen"
-1,Recived cheap knock off instead of Verizon Oem.
-1,Doesn't work
1,"I bought Vol&Bass for music. New to the wired world, I bought a SamsungSmart TV. I didn't have to buy separate TV speakers at all. My little speaker helps me hear perfectly now and it doesn't blare out into the room because I can't decipher the speech sounds -  because it 's tiny and sits right by me. I don't even have to look to read lips. From one of the chronologically challenged, this is &#34;awesome.&#34;"
1,"reasonable price, gentle wrap around the edges so it doesn't crack glass or interfere with touch sensitivity."
1,As advertised
1,Happy with purchase
-1,Not a great product !!!!! it broke a few days after ! And it's the Second case I bought
1,Works great with iphone 4s.
1,I really like this product. Holds my phone nicely. I like the swivel feature.
1,"I spent a ton of time looking for an actual waterproof case that would fit my phone. I was worried about the functionality of the bag. But the reviews on fitted cases were sketchy, and I didn't want to take the chance and trash my phone, so I went with the bag. I had strangers on the tours asking me to send them my pictures and even to take their picture."
-1,"This armband was way too big to fit my upper arm. I can't adjust the velcro small enough. I did manage to fit my phone in it, though it was a very tight fit. (I have a Motorola Photon Q with a case)."
1,Fit and performed perfectly. Definitely recommend.
1,i love my new marine tower speakers they are mounted on my jeep wrangler and they are super loud and clear!!! Thank you soo much
1,Works well
1,Worked perfectly on my iPhone 5s
1,My husband Loved it feels great and works awesome
1,"Fits the phone well and provides a much better &#34;grip&#34; than without the case. The (removable) kickstand is a nice feature to have, too. The included stylus is more comfortable than the built-in stylus. I didn't use the screen protector because I purchased a &#34;glass&#34;-type instead, but that's nice to have as a backup. I think a silver color might be a nice choice to match the phone's color, but the black works nicely, too."
1,"well constructed, fits phone perfectly, very happy!"
1,Although the back was a bit scratched it is still a very good case. It allows me to wirelessly charge which is very important.  I tested it on three different wireless chargers: 1 ring & two 3 rings.  The single ring had no problems charging the phone.
0,No instructions for how to assemble. No picture of how it is to go together until I saw this review. Initially hard to get into the case - it may work itself in easier with time.
1,"This has got to be the best portable power bank I have owned! I have owned a few of the &#34;lipstick&#34; style chargers/power banks, and all of the other power banks that I have owned don't hail in comparison to this one. It is much bigger and heavier (almost 9oz) than the other ones I had in the past, but it is still very portable. It feels like a cell phone when carrying it. This thing charges so fast and it charges very well also! I didn't receive the annoying &#34;slow charging&#34; message when I charged my Galaxy Note 3 like I did with my other power banks and chargers. I love that it stays cool with charging. There is also an LED indicator that tells you how much charge is left in the pack, but to see the indicator, you have to press the power button. It doesn't stay on. That's not a big deal for me. When I turn it on, I can know how much charge % is in the in the powerbank, so I don't need to see it the whole time the device is charging. I love that this charges anything USB! I was able to charge my phone, iPod, Bluetooth headphones, and camera with no issues. This is so convenient to have when on trips and wall outlets aren't always easily accessible. I can make sure I always have power on long car rides, when I am out and about sight-seeing, or when I can't find my product chargers. It does take a while to charge the actual power bank, but in all honesty, what would you expect from a charger with this capacity? I've needed a new one, so the opportunity presented its self to get one at a discount in exchange for a review. I couldn't pass it up! It truly is an amazing charger!"
1,"Excellent phone case! Love that it has multiple card slots and the magnetic clasp keeps the cover closed. Holds 6 cards and some cash and the magnetic clasp keeps the cover closed! Excellent product, and very durable."
1,"Great case! Especially for the price! Compared to the phone cases at the Verizon store, I saved at least 50%"
1,Great product
1,made the installation so much easier by making the connections on the bench and then just plugging in in the dash.
1,"Good product so far, bought two...we had two Newtrent products & both quit charging up, so without a charged battery to charge, they were useless & had to be replaced.  Went with a different brand because the reviews were good, the price was excellent & Anker was in the top 5."
1,"As other have said, really amazing quality and almost unbelievable that it costs so little. The arm and table clip are very sturdy and would hold up the heaviest phone completely extended. Suction cup is very strong, too. I have it mounted to a piece of smooth plastic taped to my desk. The device clip opens to a generous size and holds a Samsung S4 comfortably, could probably fit a bigger phone but definitely not a tablet."
1,Very Good.
0,Very bulky case. Adds a good inch to the depth.<br /><br />Shipped fast and arrived quickly though.
1,Good. Just be carefully when pulling them out
-1,"SORRY WRONG PRODUCT. HEEDED MOTO G, CASE."
1,These are a life saver. I've seen so many friends with cracked screens. I've not had a problem with this strong tempered glass protection. It's just like using the iPhone straight from the box.
1,It does what it is supposed to do with no problems.
1,Looks great; sturdy construct . Does its job ..
1,ok
-1,Never worked rt out the box
1,Good
-1,"It was a terrible, cheaply made case. The fingerprint scan does not work. It's to bulky for the I phone 6 plus. You have to take out 12 screws to get the phone in or out. The protective cover over the home button is paper thin. Lasted about 10 minuets. I could go on more but I think you get the point. Absolutely the worst &#34;waterproof&#34; case ever made."
1,"For the money its as good as I could expect. When I first started playing music I was using the volume button on my phone, I was disappointed with the volume with my phone set on high. Then I held the + button on the remote and wow! it is more than the speakers can handle!! After raising the volume on the remote I leave my phone volume set to about 3/4 and that is a blast."
1,Never had a screen protector with so much attention to detail!!! I love this product and the lifetime warranty.
1,It actually feels a lot sturdier then the original Apple cable.
1,Works great.
1,"This is a good case that seems to have great protection so far. I thought I would be bored with the simple blue, but it's a sleek design and how often do you look at the back anyway? Decent price in the world of phone cases, the lack of some kind of &#34;kickstand&#34; is the only critique I have. You would think everyone would have that standard by now."
1,It was great l loved it keep up the good work 
1,"convenient for when phone is low, sleek and small"
1,I love the CoverOn case for my Lumia 640 xl.  Looks and feels great in my hands.
1,"Exactly as described, at a great price."
-1,I loved this case when I got it but it stopped taking a charge after 2 months of using it. I emailed the company to let them know in hopes that they would replace it and nobody ever got back to me.
-1,So far nothing of what the direction has stated has been fact. I plugged them in to charge and the light never went from red to blue....it just went away. I tried pairing and have not been successful with that either..<br /><br />The directions are difficult to read and it appears there is no phone number for questions and help......
1,"First off Not 3 way,its 2 way but i knew that after i read all the reviews before i purchased these so im not complaining at all....Shipped really fast, hooked up and fit perfect in my 93 chevy blazer, and it sounds really good!"
0,They stop working really easily. The short length of the connection makes them very finicky.
1,Nice Watch
1,"Terrific watch band, I got this because it matches well with my watch that I normally wear. The band is comfortable and without a doubt quality, I don't see it wearing or tearing anytime soon. The leather is thick and fits well around my wrist. The locking mechanism of the connector to the Apple watch is sturdy and secured."
1,I love this case. It is a very light case but protects the borders of the phone. Very happy here
1,"Very good case. Protects phone well. Easy to assemble and take apart. Only thing is water gets trapped easily (sweat, a droplet, etc) and then you can't use touch. You HAVE to take it apart and get the water out."
1,Very compact and well made
1,ok
1,"Pretty good quality for the price.  The screen protector was impossible to not have bubbles in, but that could just be me."
1,was good untill it broke but i was rough with is so it was a miracle it lasted as long as it did
1,Charges fast. Excellent price. Works great
1,really beautiful!  Lots of compliments!
-1,Instructions suck. Why don't you give a brake down of the screen anatomy. I took mine apart according to your instruction and there is another layer your guitar wire was a bad choice as the physical characteristics tend to gravitate to the wrong layer and Your instruction says to start at the top near the microphone with knife graduating to guitar wire. When that is where the digitizer harness is. Very dangerous. Are you guys affiliated with cell phone scrap and recycle?
1,My wife likes them
-1,"This product arrived looking dingy and used. The clear plastic was completely scratched up. I definitely ordered new, so I'm not sure why the case came to me looking like it had been used and abused for a year or more. Best thing about it is that the mint color was true to the picture and is very stylish against my iPhone (though the back of the phone looks bad due to the deep scratches and ruins the whole point of showing off the lovely champagne color of my phone). If I could be assured that I would receive a scratch-free NEW case, I would use it. However, I am going to invest in a higher quality one since I can't trust this seller. Overall, a huge waste of twelve bucks. Highly disappointed."
1,I loved it
1,"Got the tempered glass, and it is THE BEST!  Goes on so easily using the hinge method, with zero bubbles, and feels like the OEM glass.  As cheap as glass screen protectors have become, there is absolutely NO reason to get any kind of plastic anymore.  Even the best of those are far inferior to tempered glass."
1,It was great thank you
1,I like this speaker the sound quality is rich.  I can put it outside while doing some project and while taking a shower.  It is convenient and easy to pair with my devices.
1,Great charger.. This is the third anker charger I've bought for myself and 5th over all.. Great capacity and best price I found. I like that I only have to recharge it once a week and use it throughout the week as needed.. Would definitely recommend
1,"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
1,"Easy to set up. Even though my GPS screen size was 5&#34;, (large and heavy) I put it up on the dash and whipped around a corner and everything stood fast.  In other words it works great!  And continues to do so after several weeks.  Oh, yes, it is very easy to take down so that thieves aren't tempted to break in and steal. I just pull the mount and screen off the dash, and lay it on the seat. I also find it easy to pull down, change the settings at the wheel and put back."
1,"Awesome,love it, delivery at my apartment do so fast. Didn't had to pay all that money at Verizon store.  Thank you so much ;)"
1,Sturdy wall charger that fit in not only the wall but in an extension cord also.  Lights up when being used so you are reminded to take it out of the outlet when not in use to save energy.<br />I use it for my Amazon Kindle Fire 2012 and it works very well.
1,Purchased as extras for travel. They stay packed with our travel bags. Will never forget phone cords again.Tthey match my phone and they work great. Very happy with purchase. Thanks!!
1,Just like the Apple OEM EarPods without the Apple Store price.
-1,"I wouldn't but it again, is nothing like the picture show, cheap material, I was disappointed"
-1,Absolutely Ridiculous!!! I wish I had paid attention to the reviews before I got this &#34;case&#34;. I don't know what it is for but it is NOT for the samsung note 4!!!!!! Learn from my mistake and don't waste your time or money!!
0,Wrong screen protector buy everything else was perfect
1,Ordered this in hopes to be able to have my phone in a spot that I could easily see where I was going if using maps. I was worried about a good fit because I currently own a Note 4 but it does fit in nicely.<br /><br />It is a suction cup mount which I was hesitant about but as long as the area you place it on is clean it actually stays in place. I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review and all views expressed are mine. That being said I am definitely satisfied with this item and belive it works very well.
0,Handy
1,exactly what I wanted
-1,"This phone did not meet my expectation, i was greatly disappointed."
1,Package arrived on time and product serves it's intended use.
1,Arrived on time with Sunday Prime.  The installation was as easy as any other iPhone model using YouTube examples for the tricks (the cables are lightly glued in three places and the prox sensor filter needs to be transferred on black phones...very helpful tips).  It's working great so far.
-1,"Product was so close to being perfect, but like others have mentioned, after 1 week, the band starts to peel away at the location it meets the watch and looks very cheap.<br /><br />I ended up going out and buying the Apple version of the identical band and it hasn't done the same issue after 2 weeks, and also has a 1 year warranty.  So close, yet lacking in perfect development and testing."
-1,Product got very hot while charging. will not recommend buying this item.
1,a bit out dated now
1,This product is perfect!!!!! It's exactly what I ordered. The exact same one that came with my phone when I originally bought it!!!!
1,"The case fits perfectly all the way around. Even the charger fits with no obstruction of the case. The rubber and the plastic combo feels good in my hands. The only negative is the kickstand which feels flimsy but it works good. Just don't put to much pressure while using the kickstand, it might brake."
1,"Good earbuds are hard to find at a great price and I was looking forward to trying these with my MP3 player and iPhone6.  It comes with 3 sizes of silicone flex sleeve so you can choose which is best fit.  I also like the MFB, one button controlling,  to use as answer/end/reject for all IOS and Android system cell phones and the play/pause/playback/previous music on all IOS and some Android phones.  The microphone works grat on my iPhone6 for others to hear what I am saying while talking and doing stuff.  It is amazing how comfortable these earbuds are even using them for a long time as I workout for 2 hours.  My ears did not feel irritated, bothered or achy after using these for my workouts.  They sound great to me with my MP3 player with a good, strong bass and blocks out sounds in background so that I only heard the earbud music and nothing else, which is great at the gym with the loud overhead music I don't want to hear.  Great product at a great price for oneself or to give as a gift.<br /><br />I received my product in return for my unbiased and honest review."
1,"Glad I got two of them, ask wife to put on phone,  I think she did not clean screen in one corner, so I took the other one to store I shop at  for them to put on. Saved money they put on for Free. Also no scratches yet!  the plastic ones scratch too easy."
-1,Terrible! I can't get the cord to uncoil and sit right when I wear them. I have adjusted the buds to try and fit my ears but they just don't fit. They fall out when I'm running and I have to charge it before every workout. The battery life is awful.
1,Great product!
1,Works great for my G37 and fast delivery too.
1,Convenient and easy to use.
-1,"Worked ok for a month battery life was only two hours, and then the week after the Amazon 30 day return expired they would not charge or turn on.  Don't buy. I had seen some reviews that they were junk but the overall review were positive so I bought a pair and had the same problem all the one star reviews said I would."
1,Stylus is slim and comfortable to hold/use. I recommend this product.
1,Lost one of my original tips on the way to the gym a few days ago.  These are exactly like the originals that came with my headphones and fit great.
1,Love it
1,Love this case! I love the shape it gives my phone. With the Droid Turbo being so big it makes it easy to hold.
1,love it
1,"The case itself is rather cute and it covers all four sides with none of the corners peeking out like some cases have. The bumpers are a bit thicker than my previous one as well, but it could definitely have a bit more padding around the edges. I do have an issue with the case though, the rubber part doesn't fit as snugly as I hoped it would at the top and bottom. I found it to be weird and it does raises some concern. Thankfully, the plastic fits around the cell and rubber case snugly."
0,"I've only had this screen protector installed for 1 week.  Yes, it was easy to install.  And the install left few to no bubbles.  I was also impressed with how it was advertised as 'scratch-proof.'  Well, that's where things took a nose dive.  Just yesterday, I had put my iphone6 (w the newly installed screen protector) in a bag with my keys.  When I reached into the bag, there were quite a few scratch marks over a a good part of my phone.  Certainly the cause was my keys.  But, this product was advertised as 'SCRATCH-PROOF.'  Luckily, there a 3 protectors to a pack.  And based on the product guide, their customer support seems to be willing to assist if I'm not fully satisfied.  We'll see how that goes..."
0,Like it but wish it was a little sturdier and tighter fitting.
1,"I received this unit as ordered and on time, with all parts accounted for.  It came charged ~75% and quickly reached 100% within 1-2 hours of plugging in.  I used it to charge up my HTC (2100 mAh) which was down to 37%, and it recharged it to 100% within one hour.  The 8400 was small and easily packable.  I bought it because of the good reviews given by other users and do not expect it to disappoint. ."
1,Easy to put on and protects the phone well. My son totally loves it. So great for the pre-paid phoen we got - the cases were not available in the store and this is exactly what he wanted. Perfect!
1,"Space gray is perfect for the gunmetal gray M9. Easy to install, use of power and volume buttons not affected. Have installed for about a month, almost no small particles have gotten under the sides or through camera cutout."
-1,Screen came with the layers separating. Lots of ghosting. Had to replace in 1 day at local place due to failure.
-1,"It doesn't fit my iPhone 4 nearly as well as an Otterbox?  I don't like the Otterbox price, but I guess that's why it was only a few dollars?"
-1,"I can't in truth describe with words how crappy this case is, but i will try. First of all the metal on the case is similar to die cast metal, like the kind they use in toys. Second, the rubber is hard rubber, so one drop and hard rubber meets metal, and say goodbye to your phone. So stupid to have a phone case made of metal. So stupid!! That is not all folks. Next, the holes in front on the gorilla glass are not covered by anything, so when you go to wipe the glass with water to wipe off the smudges, the water goes in between the glass and the phone, and you have to unscrew the back, and take the case off to clean the water off!! Lastly, the rubber piece that covers the charging port broke off after one day, because it is also made of hard rubber. This case sucks. I mean, if you buy this, you need to check your skull for bullet holes; like i did. Just stay away from this case, it is a phone killer in the disguise of an attractive case."
1,I love it
-1,It's very cheap. It cracked the first time my son dropped it from 2 feet off the ground. Throwing this away and will find a quality one
1,I like it alot! Some slight static but I'd you turn volume up on device that you are playing music from it goes away. Variety of stations to choose from if not getting good signal from a particular station. Like th remote and digital displapy. Easy peasy  to use!
1,Works Great! IPhone 5S connects perfectly and push button shutter release is perfect.
1,Good
1,"A good to have peripheral for emergency charging. Love the cable which came with it although a bit short. One con is that it is not very portable to carry on road (you cannot carry it in the pocket). However, at this price I'd take that any day."
1,"I wish it were leather.  The plastic stretches so credit cards fall out.  Leather would not do that.  Otherwise, it looks good."
1,"This case fits my iPhone 6 Plus very well. It is perfect lengthwise, but it's just slightly too wide. I have a slim silicon case on my phone, and it moves around a little in this case, so it's not a super-tight fit. The magnetic flap closes well and doesn't flap around when walking. The material is soft and comfortable to wear. Plus, the metal clip is long enough to fit securely over my wide belt. Very pleased. The case is made of good quality leather with a leather belt loop on the back and dual leather lined belt clips on either side of the belt loop, so you can either slide it securely over your belt or just clip it onto your belt for ease of removal without undoing your belt. I love the feel of the soft leather flap that secures the iPhone soundly with a magnetic closure. It accommodates my iPhone 6 Plus with the Hybrid Bumper case on it with room to spare. So it would accommodate an iPhone 6 Plus with a larger heavier case on it if you had one. All in all, it is one of the classiest phone holsters that I have owned. As a blogger I am often provided Press Sample kits by companies, just as in this case in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
1,Great.
1,Nothing goes wrong with this clear soft rubber case. I love it
1,"Good sound from both ends, does a great job!"
1,Charges my jabra clasic effectively after my puppy separated the USB plug from the one it came with
1,Isn't oke
1,looks good. I love it.
1,"It is really great , I recommend it"
0,"This case was purchased for a friend. It was purchased at the end of July and was completely useless by August 12th, because it had a short in it. She wanted to use it on a trip so ended up buying another one, and returning the bad one. The second one has worked much better. I rated it 3 stars because of the problem with the first one."
1,Received very quickly.  Worked fine.
1,"Love these cases. Had them for my s3, s5, and now iPhone 6. Very good price for a high quality case that's easy to grip and keeps my phone safe."
1,got this for my daughter's birthday looks and feels awesome. will buy another one soon for my phone
0,Trim doesn't fit my Boss double din on my 2005 Camry.
1,Bought the case and it was exactly what I was looking for. I'm very happy with the case and it was quickly received.
1,"Fast arrival!  Also, made of very good quality, strong, and beneficial."
1,Excellent
1,"Had the fitbit, but hated that it miscalculated steps on multiple occasions, particularly when I'm running errands with my kids (didn't compute the steps taken pushing a grocery cart or stroller...some days this is a lot of steps for me). So with months of researching, I gave the Vivoactive a try. Best decision I ever made!! Love the everyday look of this, but the functionality is even better. Enjoy the smartwatch capability to tell me text notifications, especially when I'm with my kids (to know if it's an important message or not). I used this watch to help me train for a half marathon this summer and it did wonderfully, even when I did cross training (pool workouts, bike workouts). Only qualm I have is that sometimes I use an indoor bike trainer for workouts (with two small children it can be challenging to get outdoors on the bike...), I find it annoying that I'd have to pay another $30 or so for the Garmin indoor bike trainer computer. Can't be perfect at everything I guess. It seems like Garmin is doing a great job of updates/improvements to their software too in the few months that I've had it now. Also I really like Garmin's Connect App. Keep up the good work!"
-1,"I had to return the first one I received. The phone would not charge in any position. The replacement will charge the phone(galaxy s5) horizontally and upside down but not right side up vertically which is ,of course, the way it needs to be if you intend to look at it while charging. I like the design but form over function will not do."
1,Works just as good as the other higher priced cases
1,Awesome deal! Case fits well and have gotten many compliments on it!
1,This wireless charger works great. Very happy with the charge speed and reliability.  Works better than the Samsung wireless charger that I was using prior.
1,It very useful
-1,"Bought 3, missing one cord!!!!!"
0,The case fit very well and was very nice. I had to return it because the case would not let it charge on the charging pad though. Very nice product otherwise.
1,I like some much
1,Great Speaker for the money for sure.  Good Quality and sound. It's not as loud as my Braven but it didn't cost $100 either.
1,This is so cute! It fits my samsung galaxy s4 perfectly.  It stays closed well.
1,The item arrived as expected and os wprking fine
1,"My husband loves these shoes. I first purchased the orange/black ones and he liked them so much I got him the blue ones too. The blue color is super sharp, very vibrant and he gets compliments on them often. They fit true to size, he wears 10.5 in Adidas and an 11 in Nike. He says they are super light and feel like he's not even wearing shoes. I will likely buy him another pair of the blue ones to have for the future."
-1,Good price bad quality
1,"This is a really simple case and was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />I swapped out my Work BlackBerry for an iPhone 5c and I swear the iPhone is made of Teflon. I needed something to counter the extreme slickness and this Caseology case does the trick while not greatly increasing they size of the phone.<br /><br />If the iPhone esthetics are critically important to you, you can still see the original phone through the clear backing. It manages to be &#34;gripable&#34; without pulling everything in your pocket out with it like some cases I have seen. The corner bumpers look like they will provide enough protection for modest drops and all of the switches are still easily usable.<br /><br />A great value."
-1,The touch responsiveness is completely trash.
-1,"Thank you for getting it to me fast, but the phone in obsolete. Just over internal storage or lack there of. Just not capable of operating correctly, can't handle apps and updates.<br />I bought it for a quick fix, when I broke my screen on another phone. Getting ready to go back to broken screen phone for the time being..<br />Waste of money."
0,Had to take phone out of case to charge because case to thick
1,"This case is adorable! I love the color and the elephant design. It's the perfect size for my iPhone, with no interference of the volume or power buttons or the speaker and charging port. Has 2 card slots which is perfect for my license and debit card. The magnetic closure is nice too. No cumbersome button to deal with. That being said, the only thing that would make this a 5 star product would be another magnet on the back to hold the cover when using the phone. Overall  a great product and the different designs it comes in are beautiful.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review"
1,good price and quality
1,great product
1,Excellent!
1,I love it !
1,Had this case ever since I bought my s5. Has definitely done it's job protecting my phone.
-1,"I just wasted my money I wish I kept bb the packaging. First is hard to use the edge of the phone I meant you have to press the edge part of the screen harder, still i decided to keep it but the worst part is it came off of my phone."
1,"The ubiquitous mobile phones have become an indispensable tool of modern living. They are expensive and fragile, and therefore they need to be protected from the vagaries of the environment and accidental impacts. This has led to the development of a variety of protective cases, of different brands, price and quality. The most expensive are not necessarily the best.<br /><br />The iSelector Waterproof case is one of the best overall such cases on the market today. It is exactly as depicted in the photos and described in the sales promo. It is sturdy, made of TPU, molded hard PC plastic and Tempered Glass Screen Protector that  works flawlessly with iPhone 6's Touch ID. The case weighs 2.51 oz/ 11.5 grams and is 0.5&#34;/13mm thick. The granular surface is slip-proof and the reinforced corrugated corners absorb most impacts. All ports, buttons and controls align perfectly and are accessible. Package contains the case, a tiny flathead screwdriver, a lanyard and user manual. Set up is easy and intuitive.<br /><br />I tested the case by placing tissue paper inside it then buried it in dirt, tried to scratch it with finger nails, dropped it from a third floor balcony on concrete and finally, fully immersed it overnight in a sink full of water. The results confirmed that the iSelector case is indeed waterproof, weatherproof, dust/dirt proof and shock proof - no scratch, no leaks, no cracks, no dirt - nothing, nada!<br />Headphone port only fits the original Apple jack and does not require an extension (contrary to most cases on the market).<br />With the phone inside the case, sound quality is excellent. No damping or muffling.<br /><br />I took my iPhone 6 (inside the case) with me on a boat ride this week-end and, for the first time, did not need to put it in a cumbersome plastic locking &#34;waterproof &#34; through which one cannot dial, answer a call or take a picture - all of which I was able to do easily with the iSelector Waterproof case.<br />I really like it and shall keep my phone well protected inside this case.<br /><br />I received a coupon to purchase this item, but with no obligation to write a review. This is not a barter deal. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees.is case.  I received a coupon to purchase this item, but with no obligation to write a review. This is not a barter deal. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees."
1,It charges fairly quick. I like that it can charge my Kindle and my phone at the same time. The only downside is that it is big and sort of heavy. But you need that for all of the power it produces.
1,SUPER cute and fast shipping. Thank you!!
-1,I get loud humming and buzzing noise when my radio volume is up. Tried multiple stations and still getting the annoying sounds. Want to return.
1,Wrong one for my phone but a nice phone clip
1,works perfect and holds my phone very snugly and no wiggling.
-1,Not good it working but the time is wrong .
1,very loud and works awesome we've had it a month or two now no problems !
1,"The larger bottom portion is easy to install, the thinner top is a bit tricky.  Watch the tabs."
0,"This watch band is absolutely beautiful!  However, it was too small for my wrist, and I have a (what I believe to be ) normal 7.5-inch wrist.  I had to have the band buckled on the last adjustment hole making the band as large as possible, but then there wasn't a lot of band left to go into the loops and didn't feel very secure.  (For reference, I have a M/L Apple watch band and secure it on the 2nd tightest hole.)  If you have a very small wrist, this will be perfect for you!"
1,Very good product.
1,I was expecting the same connector as was provided with the phone.  It instead had a standard micro USB connector rather than the USB 3.
0,"Actually i purchased this device because of being waterproof (the only one i could find among many others) however i was dissapointed since in less than 3 months use, the rubber band joint with the core device was detached hence allowing water to infiltrate inside. I'm no more using it as a waterproof bracelet, I remove it every-time i shower, and obviously i no more swim wearing it.<br />My use of the bracelet in water was like normal: under shower , and swimming once a week."
1,Great itrm
1,Alright
1,"The arm band is really small. Barley fit arounds my arm. Besides that, works great!"
1,Great
1,GREAT durable phone case!  I purchased three in different colors and my teenaged grandsons really like them!
1,Comfortable and fits phone perfectly.
1,This is a great portable charger.  I do wish it was flat instead of square but it is worth the price
1,"Great case, like it!"
1,Works good
1,I get soooo many compliments on this cover! Love it :)
1,They covered my Ipod that broke w/in a yr
1,Well made and works great.
1,"Great product. Wall/car charger, cable and pouch.  Looks slick but you have to remove the cover if your going to use the wall charger and that can get lost."
1,Charger works well on our Iphone 5 products and sturdier than the ones that come with the phones
1,Great phone. Not as fast as I would like. Still a great phobe
1,I really like this. I took a 30 minute drive consisting of sharp turns and potholes and my phone stayed in the holder the whole time. It's very secure and easy to install. Ipow is a great brand but DO NOT purchase this from Lunar Tech Deals. They have horrible customer service.
1,This is the best android phone shield I had bought. It is made well. Installation is simple and easy. Make sure to follow the instruction. With a little skill I was able to install it perfectly.
-1,"My Mpow Bluetooth does not work after 4 weeks.  After recharge, the Mpow button keeps blinking red and there is no sound.  I would like to replace or repair it.  Pls contact me for what to do next.  Thank you."
1,"If you want rigid and sturdy, these work for that."
1,Thanks!
-1,Horrible. Phone was DEF not new as described. Just the worse deal I have done on amazon
1,"The case is exactly as described and show! The color is so cute and the back is clear enough. The lettering on the back of my phone is readable. I would recommend to anyone. It protects well, but is hard to get off."
0,"Love the case...the holster is another thing. Protects better than a Life Proof besides the waterproof part. (Bought a LifeProof took it out of the package and immediately returned it. Felt like a $3 case, what a joke.) Popped out the cheap screen protector and put a tempered glass one on my phone. Had a scary drop from about 5.5ft on the corner of the case. Bounced a few times and never missed a beat, not a scratch on the phone. Great case feels like it can take a beating and still protect your phone.<br /><br />The holster is cheaply made and broke after a month of regular use. The plastic tab you use to take your phone in and out snapped off. Very disappointed in that portion of the product. The holster is the main reason I bought the case. SupCase needs to redesign the case. If the holster didn't break it would've been a 5 star for sure."
1,love it!! nice & durable to protect my phone without being too bulky.
1,I love this product. A lot of my friends have these  and day they love them. I just got my request for this product.
-1,"It didn't work and I had to send it back. I was going to have to take my case off every night in order for the phone to charge because it wouldn't work through the case I had on my phone. It shouldn't matter what case I have, it should be strong enough to charge."
1,"I do like this case, but something I noticed was that the back of the case is really hard and made of a strange feeling material. The rubber inside is also not as malleable or flexible as I would expect it to be, but it did fit my phone well. I'm just not sure of how well it would protect my phone damage if I were to drop it. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review"
1,just what i was looking for
-1,This phone case is not a good case at all. The coloring on the case peels off.
1,So far it is awesome.  The mirror is alright
1,woks just like advertised we like it
-1,"i expected thick rubber that protected the pone and had a great feel. This feels slippery in hand. the colour looks great for me, but disappointed wit finish and feel."
1,"What do I like about this product: • It is compact and light • It can be paired easily with my smartphone • It has crystal clear sound • The buttons are located on the blue tooth headsets which takes a little time to get used to but once I knew how to use them, it is very easy • It can go 4-5 hours without charging. USB cable to charge is included with this product. • After using it for some time, I forgot that I had the headset in my ears.  Additional Information: It comes with Bluetooth headset, USB charger, USB earphones (for the other ear) and ear hook.  Overall opinion: Very good  Sample received from seller in exchange of honest and unbiased review."
1,"Best device I ever bought beyond my exceptions and more,  Would recommend this to all my Friends"
-1,"If i'd reviewed this within say a month of buying it, I would have had good things to say. It feels and looks nice and the little door to store cards works fairly well. But after three months, I just bought a different case and wouldn't recommend this one. First, it got very dirty looking quickly, and I couldn't get the marks off of it. Some kind of clear coating began to rub off the corners from being in my pocket, causing additional discoloration.<br /><br />The door/card storage honestly isn't great. I always had trouble prying out the card on the bottom (often to the point of having to remove the entire case). I wanted it to keep my metro card handy, which obviously means opening it two times a day minimum, plus whenever I used my credit card. Long story short, the door started to wear out after about six weeks and finally broke off completely after three months of normal use."
1,Great product
1,"What more can you say? It does its job, and hasn't shown any signs of being defective."
1,Received on time and as described. Will use again.
1,OK. Good seller
1,"This screen is incredible!  I was so hesitant to apply the screen myself, thinking I would mess it up, but the company emailed me a convenient, step-by-step set of specific directions that were simple and easy to follow.  I had my laptop open, with the instructions on the screen, and in five minutes the new screen protector was on perfectly!  Great quality, great customer service!"
1,This cover fit perfectly...it's whimsical...cute...everyone that has seen it loves it...
1,Case showed up quickly and I love it!  Great for my work.  Fully protects phone (don't think it would survive a hard fall however) but it's NOT bulky and small enough to use comfortably.  Well done manufacturer!
1,"I love this case.  At first, it seemed to block the power button on the right side, but the phone and I are new to each other, so maybe I was just doing something wrong.  I have had the case a month now and I put this phone through hell.  The case is PERFECT.  I'm so happy with this purchase.  I only wish there was a way to attach the stylus."
-1,It eats the battery
1,They work.
1,"Good quality case, more durable and better than the last two cases I've gone thru."
1,Great.
1,Love this!
-1,I've had this case a little over a month and the most important part of the phone case broke off. I noticed it while I was trying to get my card out. One of the notches that keeps the flap closed is broken.. Very disappointed I loved everything about this case until that happened. Also sad that the case gets &#34;stained&#34; by jeans...
1,What can one say but WOW- Got his a few days ago and it works great. Charges the iPad / iPhone fast. It does get hot even when charging the iPad alone. But WOW it does it perfectly.
1,good one
-1,Didn't protect the glass
1,So far no problems but has some features that are not that easy to understand since I am not that cell phone smart. I hope I can figure out the issues that I am having.
1,"Great case!  It's slick looking, easy to put on, has padding on corners, and little tiny &#34;feet&#34; on back to keep it from sliding off slippery surfaces.  Kind of wish it came in other colors than it did (and there were several to choose from), but I just didn't care for those shades.  But I definitely liked the silver.  Sold and happy!"
1,"It rocks! Honestly if you need to keep your cellphone running all day because you work all day and you use your smartphone so much, dont think twice about it. Get Anker! It holds a lot of power and the price is more than fair ! Charges phone super fast !"
-1,Advertised to be an LG G3 But it was not.<br />Very disappointed and then they wanted me to text them in England to make arrangements to send it back.<br />I am not wasting my money on these people ever again.
1,Great camera worked very well .Thanks.
-1,I really like it but it looks like one corner is already coming loose and I just have it for two weeks.<br />You can see the pictures and compared with the other corner and see what I mean.
1,"The LG battery I ordered for my cell phone works perfect. I am very pleased with the product, price and service."
-1,I accidentally dropped my ipod touch and now it is shattered not to mention my ipod slips ou of the pocket that is supposed to hold it tight. It is also extremely bulky and should not even be called a case. This leather pouch is terribly fit and was an extreme let down DO NOT get it.
1,👌🏽
1,Great product
1,Good product
1,Enjoying this case. Very pleased.
1,"fits most USB cables, and is convenient and design is what I like."
1,"I LOVED THEM! Yes, LOVED, I lost them at school a couple of days ago, it hurt so much I actually had a dream where I found them. They looked nice, and had a great sound for the price, definitely recommend them, it's a shame I lost them, excellent quality for its price."
1,Great sound and great support
1,"Works well. Same as previous, Battery is difficult or impossible to replace."
1,Fit perfectly
-1,not good for me ..
1,I love it...
1,The screen protectors fit perfectly and they are great.
-1,Started to tear the first time I used it.
0,"Just got the product, seems to be working okay."
1,Great
1,"Verizon tower is about 15 miles away from our new acreage home, with complete radiant barriers in roof and walls.  .  One or two bars or -105db.  After installation, 4 to 5 bars.as low as -74 db, at least -88db.  I left transmitting antenna in attic or it would probably be even better, because I couldn't bring myself to drill holes in my new walls.  Glad I got the directional outdoor antenna.  Easy to install."
0,Great sound for a small speaker. Blue tooth range a little short.
1,This was exactly what I needed to mount my cell phone holder to the dash.  They arrived on time and met my expectations.
1,Really solid.  Love the look.  Quality product.
1,"I just figured out that this is rechargeable!  I used my Kindle cord and it worked. I also noted that it is important to turn it off when finished, as that drains the battery."
1,"The screen i ordered didnt come with adhesive, so i ordered this adhesive which came quickly and worked perfectly.  The included tweezers are excellent and youll have enough leftover to do many other future devices."
-1,Stopped charging after only one month.  Very disappointed
1,Works great
-1,I hate the Zagg invisibles girls HDX - HD! It's rubbery surface collects every piece of dust that is in the air and it is very hard to clean. It is also hard to drag your finger across smoothly. What I did like was Zagg's eagerness to have a satisfied customer and and to offer me a solution to the problem.
-1,This phone was a disaster.  It would not go into 4G mode when 4G was available.  After searching the web I learned that there was an un-fixable bug with the RAZRs and 4G.  I lived with it for two weeks and then the speaker stopped working on the phone.  At that point I returned it.
1,Item as specified.
1,Great product for the price
1,"I use this as an auxiliary battery for my iPhone when I'm running Road Bike Pro, which between GPS and Blue Tooth sensors (heart rate, speed, and cadence) can run down the phone's built-in battery pretty quickly.  This extends my usable ride time by hours.  I love the %charged readout!"
1,Perfect fit looks great
1,Good!!
1,"I have to say this is one of my favorite cases! Ive seen alot with the glitter but none with the rhinestones. It fit pefects. Looks amazing. I love the little bow on it! Great touch!! Its very durable. Ive had no problems. I have dropped my phone with this case on it, and it didnt crack the case or my phone. It doesnt leak. Its all around an amazing, beautiful case!! I was given this product for a discount for an honest review! You will not be disappointed if you buy this case!!"
1,I love these chargers.  I have ordered more than one in the past.  I got them on a lightning deal.  The price is right and I don't get that annoying message on my phone saying that it doesn't support this cable/accessory.  My phone charges fast.  I have a cable at work and one at home.  I highly recommend these chargers. You
1,great case but nothing to keep it closed
1,Fast delivery and works perfectly!
-1,Product does not work.
1,Connects immediately. Turns on and off by it self. Couldn't ask for anything more.<br /><br />The only minor complaint is that the adhesive for the magnetic disc doesn't stick in the heat. But I can't hold the 100+ degree heat against it.
-1,Won't pair with my phone...
1,Really Nice
1,Great product
1,Fast charger.  2 ports 4.8 amps. I would recommend this. Good price. I use this often. I like and use this a lot for my ipad 3
0,It is OK for the price.  the magnet does close and open well.. the way it is bound together isn't strong and will probably wear out.. but it was cheap and attractive..
1,"It does the job alright and it's cheap (price wise)  Buttons are kinds stiff to push, meaning you have to press hard for them to work, my original Jeep remote that worked was more accurate feeling and just the right pressure to push, but it works."
0,"I would give it a 5 if it used the same charging cord as the iPhone 6, I believe it's called a lightning cable.<br /><br />This is the second case I've owned from this company, and they're great for the most part.<br /><br />I cannot figure out how to contact the seller, but my case has suddenly changed from a silicon feeling to like scaley cracked (and I have not dropped it)."
1,"I LOVE my wallet/iphone 6plus case!! It arrived on time, as proimsed and in excellent condition."
0,Power cord way too short  About 1.5 feet
1,A great 2 in 1 cable this is one of the best I had. I love that I can use it for 2 charging electronics. Comes in a nice box for protection. It is attached good. The plastic cable feels great quality and I know it won't break easy.  I really like that it is reinforced on the ends of the cables where the plastic tends to break easy. Cable is soft but great quality. It is easy to interchange the head attachments. I have used it in my iPhone 6 plus and on my iPad and it works perfectly.  It also works to charge other items. I can also sync with no problem or issues popping up. Really good cable. Worth it various product uses. I recommend it. Great plastic quality.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest option.
1,Got my case on time. Love it
1,Perfect for slim fit protection.
1,"Great product, delivered early. Easy to install and bubble free as stated. Crystal clear like there isn't a protector at all."
1,I love these blue cables...Long and they are a very good quality.  Now when I'm looking for a cord to use to recharge my phone I just reach for the blue cable.
1,easy to use. clear for me and the other person.
1,"Fabulous!  Such an easy, inexpensive fix for my expensive Bose docking station, which has been sitting in my closet for several years since it ceased to pair with my iphone."
0,screen and sound quality on the 5 inch truck car gps 560 is not so good it does not compare to the Tom Tom or the Garmin Nuvi.  Xgody should have preformed these tests so there GPS can compare to them.
-1,Not what I expected
-1,Don't waste your money! It was supposed to come with 2 tempered glass covers and only came with one! The best part was the one it came with was waaaay too small and not cut for the 42mm Apple Watch. It didn't cover a large portion of the watch face. I hate when people sell stuff under a description that isn't true! This is one of those those items on AMAZON. Don't waste your hard earned money even its only a few bucks. This was a total waste of a few bucks!
1,Great fit for my samsumg note
1,"The kit looks nice in the car. Although the instructions are pretty bad. And the piece that is supposed to replace the lcd screen doesn't fit at all. Took me a long time to figure out that two of the brackets that came with the kit actually are used to put the lcd screen back in (note the instructions say nothing about it). After I figured it all out I was a very happy guy. Before I figured it out, very aggravated. Overall good product"
1,Really durable.  With toddlers at home this case will definately prolong the life of my phone!  Cute design too!
-1,Lasted a month. Started to crack at a corner and went all the way through. Had to remove because I didn't want my phone to get damaged. Clear bumper starts to yellow too. My mother was not smart and paid retail. SIGH
1,"Great sound , about 3 hr battery life before needing recharge"
1,Fit and works great !
1,This seems to work pretty well!
1,Great!
1,It is working good
1,I bought 2 over 3 years ago and they are still stuck in the same place.  Never came loose or off.
-1,"I bought One case from such seller,but water entered on my cell,and my phone was not working any more,but the seller did nothing only pay for the money of the case about 35.99 $!"
-1,I totally agree with the previous 1 star reviews. This battery will not hold a charge for even a day. I switched back to my nearly year old OE battery cause this on lasts only about 6 - 7 hours on standby.  Junk.
1,Husband uses this does not have blue tooth in his car.  Works great!
-1,"Good: The sound quality is OK, but is a bit &#34;tinny&#34;. The fit is a bit unusual, but once you get used to putting them in, it's not so bad. Very lightweight and easy to use.<br /><br />Bad: Something has shorted out in my set within the first few days of use. Whatever blew out partially MELTED the controller next to the &#34;volume down&#34; button and has left the unit smelling burned and completely non-functional. I'd give it a lower rating, but I know that this might not be typical for these products. Still, it clearly tried to catch on fire, so that's not something I'm particularly happy about either."
-1,"When it received a product, it was abandonment very much that a hook had been already broken."
-1,Disappointed in the phone
1,Case exactly like picture.  Was delivered rather quickly
-1,strange looking shell for an external drive; I wonder where the usb cable is located at; maybe under the cap.  I did not know that pvc welding adhesive was conductive for electronic use.  :-)
1,prefect.
0,"I have used this unit and I like its telephoto/magnifying feature.  Although GPS would be nice, the night vision feature has proven useful.  With many products to choose from, this one is decent for the price."
1,Really easy to install! The YouTube video was very helpful!
1,Excellent way to mount a phone.
0,Well the box is well built. Worth the 60.00 just for the box. Didn't last too long. Pyle of crap... But box is worth the cost. Put a Kicker CompR and sounds great!
1,"It has an amazing battery life, I can use it while I charge it, and as long as I leave my phone's bluetooth on, I just turn it on and it automatically connects."
-1,No good
1,Protects my phone really well and I love the colors of the case
1,Omg! Where has this been all my life?!?!?! Totally in love!!! Gym time just got more exciting!!
1,Good
1,Love this amount of pens.  Like another reviewer said these are great for the office where we also have a problem of pens growing legs and walking off.  Gave 100 to the interns and about 50 to our admin office for the sign in books and still have enough for the family if they need pens or we are scrambling for something to write with.
1,"I've had this for a while now and I'm very happy with my perchace, I had looked into many different power banks but I know I needed it to be very big, I decided to get this one and have been very surprised with the size, I'll charge my iPod and phone and many friends and families devices including iPads and other tablets and it felt like I had to try to kill the battery! It is large, that wasn't a problem for me because I just wanted a lot of power but it could be a problem. The only other concern is there's been 2 times (out of probably 30 or 40) times when I plugged it in and I wasnt able to get it to start charging, id try again later and it worked fine but it may be a concern but I'm very glad I perchaced this and if your looking for a big power bank id recomend it!!"
1,Good quality. I have had two other chargers that got really hot when they charged items. So far I am pleased with it's performance. It does not overheat and I now can plug all my items in at one location.
1,The first transmitter I received worked for about a month. A replacement transmitter was sent out right away and works perfectly.
-1,Broke and plastic is cheap and scratches
1,Perfect
1,"I had a previous version of this radar detector and loved it. The only issue was that there were many times that it would receive a radar signal from a car passing by with collision avoidance system. This product has an updated system with a lesser amount of nuisance alerts and 90% of the time, there is actually a cop detecting radar when the alert sounds."
1,Great value. Comfortable and never fall out of your ears while working out.<br />Buy these.
0,"Recommend for short term use and if you change cases often. Very bulky but protective, design/pattern looks cheap in person, good purchase for extra items including screen cover and stylus however screen cover scratched and did not last more than two months but good temporarily."
1,Love my selfie stick!
-1,Battery did not work. Purchased another from another retailer and worked just fine. Thanks
1,Bought several cases at once and really liked this at of all. It is not bulky at all and I've dropped my phone about 10 Xs already and it is fine though it always scares me because it isn't a bulky protector type case but it has worked like one so far. Hopefully I don't drop now and it breaks since I have a great review. 😉
1,indestructible and will not come off of your belt. fits the galaxy 5 snug and securely
-1,I do not recommend this aux cord. This is my second time buying one that retracts and both have had static and make weird noises.
1,Great case! Very nice.
1,"Fits perfectly, have to press hard to operate the touch screen especially getting close to the edges."
1,Same good quality as always
1,Fit was good...kickstand a little tough to pullout..
1,Great armband. Just know if you are a small girl with tiny arms it may not fit you. My barely stays snug on my arm.
1,"Seriously, if you don't have this on your $600+ phone you're making a mistake.<br />I slapped on of these on my mom's phone and forgot all about it.<br /><br />She freaked out after dropping her and cracking the screen<br />and I reminded her about the temper glass screen protector.<br />I peeled off the cracked screen protector and behold! The iPhone screen was without a scratch!<br /><br />Spend the $5 and just get it!"
1,good one
1,Exact as it shows came in 2 days love the product
-1,"Buyer beware. I loved these AT FIRST.  Slowly after a couple of months, the pairing became more difficult.  I'd have to forget the headphones and restart/reboot my iPods and iPhone every time.  This becomes frustrating.  It's shortened my workouts because sometimes it takes 15 minutes.  Today, it's been almost 30 minutes.  I threw them away in frustration.  Sadly, I bought my niece a pair right before all the problems.  I hope she's one of the lucky ones.  Is it worth $20 for something that might only work 3-4 months? Your call."
-1,Broke fast
1,"This LCD protector looks very cool on my phone, i will recommend it if you want your phone's face to look like a mirror"
1,Great great Great great Great great
0,Not bad
1,Product as described.
1,Really good case. I like it.
1,"excellent value I have used this on my Motorcycle,as security camera in my home (we caught the thief) ,batter will last all day+"
1,case fit perfectly.
1,"Easy to install, no issues at all."
1,Great case just what I wanted.
-1,I got this product and the instructions that go with it are not clear.  The pictures are too small and the instructions are written for someone who already knows how to repair iphones.  I was unable to install the new screen.  I had to take it to a mall kiosk where they told me that the screen provided in this kit is not an actual iphone screen and is more of a replica.  I am not sure if that is true.  I don't recommend this product for the price.
1,Excellent
1,"van for holder window, thank you<br />Horace"
1,Worked well. Simple an inexpensive.
1,Did not fiphone. To big.
1,very superior Case 5 Stars
1,"Very nice and cute, the staff also helped me change it to a six plus case!"
1,This cable is great! I've had it for over a month without any problems at all.  The extra long plug allows music to be played via Life Proof Case covered smart phone. Keeps mom and teenager both happy lol
1,works
1,"Really nice to have around.  Charges phone quickly and lasts a long time.  Does take some time to charge,  but totally worth it."
0,Good product
1,"Perfect fit! Great case, better than otter box."
1,"So far so good. No screen sensitivity issues. Installed very easy. For a $16 tempered glass screen protector, especially for the 6 edge, it's a great product. I recommend."
1,It's very cute although it's extremly slippery. I ordered it a month ago and it's still not here.
1,Does what its supposed to. Fitment could be better... but it is pretty inexpensive.
1,I love the credit card holder! The color wasn't my favorite but I love how well it works as a wallet and phone case.
1,"Nice, light weight, convenient, gives an extra charge to my iphone (note that you will need an adapter to be able tu use it with an iphone as this comes with a micro USB plug)."
1,very nice for the price daughter and husband loved these. Very comfortable.
-1,Stinks
1,Works awesome so far!
1,Great protection for phone and went on easily
1,"I've owned otter box, spigen, etc.<br /><br />This is the best case I've owned."
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
-1,This battery lasted a day. I was very disappointed. I would have returned it but my husband threw out the paperwork.
-1,Second hand and dirty
-1,You get what you pay for.
-1,"I was going to buy these but noticed a lot of bad reviews with similar complaints.  Mostly that they are uncomfortable, slide off easily and are not water proof as advertised.  Thanks for the heads up!"
1,Very kewl watch case covers for my new Apple watch. The price was super and quick shipping. I recommend this seller.
-1,I thought this case was an extra battery plus provided doe protection. Nope I dropped my phone an it cracked. Plus I'm charging the case way too much. Mophie doesn't deserve even a 1 star.
1,Good.
1,Excellent
1,My granddaughter loves it...
1,Just what I ordered  Held at 100 MPH
-1,"Awful. Hard to get on,  doesn't protect. Waste of money"
-1,goodjob!
1,"It's perfect,best screen saver I ever purchased"
1,"Works well, synced fine and I'm not tech savvy. The band is comfortable. It seems to be more secure than my polar F4 that I bought about a year ago. I did use it a lot though so it just kind of wore out a little. Update: 8/30/15 I tried to swim in my endless pool today and it didn't work so well. It didn't keep my heart rate like my polar does. I'm going to try to tighten it next time or see if I can use it with my Polar strap and see how that works. I like to do high-intensity interval training so if this doesn't work with my polar strap and this is getting sent back. I simply have to see my heart rate while I'm swimming. I took away a star for this."
1,I like this case a lot. It fits well and protects the phone. My only complaint is that I dropped my phone and the case easily dented. My phone was ok but the case has some damage but still functions.
1,Love the arm band. The material is soft. It is very comfortable on the arm. Fits like a glove on my phone.
1,very good item good price too
1,Worked nicely!!! Easy to use and well made. Just what I needed to install and after market radio.
1,Good convenient size for a briefcase. Wish the lighting end was a bit smaller so it wouldn't interfere with my case.
1,"Synced to my watch and cycle computer very quickly. Comfortable to wear, I don't even notice it after a few minutes."
1,"This is a great item.  I use my phone as a scanner.  It usually goes down very quickly.  I can attach this and it charges the phone back up.  It is remarkable for such a small, inexpensive item."
1,Awesome case. Very protective case without being bulky.
1,Nice and minimal. Good grip
1,"Easy to replace, worked perfectly."
1,I love this!
1,Really nice charging cable. Feels thicker than my apple one that came with my iPod touch and it has metal connectors so it should last.
1,Thanks!
1,Takes awhile to get here but I love the design and bumper but it's not waterproof tried it on my old iPhone 5c and it stoped working but it's an awesome case
1,It was very handy the mother in law is happy. The shipping was fast and on time
1,Delivered fast!  Super easy to install and only got one tiny bubble which came out easily. Can't even tell the film protector is on the phone. No stickiness to it. 5 stars for sure.
1,NICE
1,Good
1,Unu's super pack was given to me for review purposes and I believe they make some of the best products especially for the iPhone and iPad. This little external charger is great for anyone on the go and doesn't have access to an outlet to plug in the phone. Right after receiving the super pack I noticed that my phone battery was low. Down to 20% so I plugged it in because it came charged up and ready for use. I was able to get 1 full charge within less than 30mins. This thing charges your device quickly and is smart enough to know when your phone is fully charged and stop charging.  I love the fact there is a push button switch to turn it on and off and led lights to show you how much battery is left in the charger. I will be bringing this external 5000mah battery pack with me everywhere I go just because of it shear size.<br /><br />UNU has always made great products and this one doesn't fall short. It is one of the best external chargers I have use. Better than morphie or any other knock off brand. I will be recommending this to anyone who is always on the go because it's small enough to place in your pocket.
0,Ok will buy again
1,"great for small arms, doesn't slip when I get sweaty like other armbands I've had."
-1,"I received the phone quickly. It was in passable shape but after one day the screen turned yellow. Upon further inspection, there is a small crack on the inside portion of the top right screen. We have tried to reboot the phone to no avail."
1,"This scanner ROCKS!been using it for overs month now and I am extremely pleased. Get a different antenna though. Other than that, love it!"
1,Works great as a transmitter to my Bluetooth earbuds for watching TV late at night. Does not work while USB charging.
1,"I've tried many different bands and have had an allergic reaction to the metal on most of them, even Apple's $50 sport band.  And other leather bands aren't genuin leather because they crack as soon as you bend them.  This band is amazing!  No rash from the metal clasp and no cracks in the strap at all.  I bought the red and was so happy I went back to buy the black.  Only wish they offered more colors."
1,An excellent auxiliary cord that doesn't crackle when moved around. Very pleased with this purchase. Extremely pleased with the price considering I paid about $15 at a retailer for another cord in my wife's car. Highly recommend this product
1,Good item. I am happy with it.
-1,Case was cracked when it arrived and pieces have been falling off it already ordered another case from otter box
1,"If your phone supports fast charging thanks to the Qualcomm 2 chipset, you needed this yesterday. It charges amazingly fast. My HTC One M8 will go from near death to 100% in about 20 minutes, which is incredible to me. Got one for the car also and it also charges super fast. I would dock it a star for being such a plug hog in the wall, but it's the right height, and displaces it's size in width, leaving room for another plug."
-1,The male end for plugging into the device is too long. Doesn't stay in.
0,"Cheap, light, adequate player. Bluetooth functionality for external speaker link only, Not for file transfers. 8gb built in memory, micro SD slot to expand. Can only access your files on one or the other though, not both at the same time."
1,Worked just like it should. As expected
1,"This device was the perfect solution for listening to music in my car.  My car came with a factory-installed iPod cable for listening to music through the radio, but after 4 years it no longer works. It would have been $445 to repair!  I started looking for a cheaper alternative, and this is it.  I am also happy that since my car has both a USB and auxiliary port, this little device charges itself as I drive.  I'm also happy that I can use my iPhone 6 with a Lifeproof case on it without having to worry about a headphone adaptor for the case, since I'm now using the phone's Bluetooth.  Also, I'm not sure if this applies to all phones, but I can still receive Bluetooth calls through the car's system, and it will just pause the music Bluetooth on this device.  Easy to install and easy to use!"
1,"For me, the most impressive feature about this device is how quickly it charges.  I plug it in just before I head out for the 15-minute or so drive to the local metro station and by the time I arrive, my phone is fully charged.  Also, the second port has proven to be a surprisingly convenient feature. My wife uses her phone quite a bit when she is in the passenger's seat, so she keeps her phone plugged in while mine is also charging.  Of course, it isn't just capable of charging mobile phones.  I've used it to charge a bluetooth headset and a tablet with equally good results.  Finally, the compact design is great for maintaining the car's interior aesthetics as it does not become a hulking plastic eyesore protruding into the cabin.  All said, this is an efficient, effective device for what has become a near necessity these days, which is the ability to recharge our electronics on-the-go."
1,Nice & sturdy. Fits phone well & kickstand works great
-1,The case itself would be great if it would fit properly and if it didn't have excess platick around the edges wich is sharp and is not suppose to be their.... Every case needs to be checked to make sure its made right because mine was just horrible..  Would not recommend this product
1,"Me & My wife have matching phones and matching cell phone wallet cases and we love it, works great fast speed, a lot of space on the phone to save and store data."
-1,It looks really cute but within a day the rhinestones fell off and within a week the eges started to look frayed. I'm going to have buy another case and i've only had this one for a little while
1,"great and all, but collecting dust under it already"
-1,"Got this to replace my FitBit Flex that had bit the dust for the 2nd time.<br /><br />If all you are looking for is a pedometer/exercise tracker, then you may like it.  If you are looking for something that will work with other fitness apps, forget it and keep looking.  The S Health app from Samsung leaves A LOT to be desired, especially if you are accustom to My Fitness Pal or apps like that.  It doesn't even come close.  From what I've been able to find, I'm not sure it will ever work with My Fitness Pal.<br /><br />For my money, another FitBit would have been a better investment."
1,For the money you won't find a better case for your phone.
1,They work well
1,"The case on amazon was the best price I could find and it came really quickly.  It came all intact and everything as stated.  Love how sleek it is.  I bought one for my iPhone 6 plus, this one is on my husband's iPhone 6."
1,"Everything is right with the holder. color, adjustable, size. Like it a lot and it goes well with my bike !!"
0,Don't come with volume control
1,Good
1,"Fast service, the case is really nice and strong. Would purchase again from seller."
1,Have had one of these for 8 months and I dont even notice that its on my phone. Recently dropped my phone on its face and the screen protector cracked but the phone screen underneath is perfect. I believe it did what it was supposed to do. Will be ordering another one.
-1,"Worked great and comfy for the price, until my iPhone 6 fell out and cracked! Since this case is made for multiple phone brands, it doesn't fit the iPhone 6 &#34;snug&#34; and has room to wiggle when not completely tight on your arm. Now I have a cracked screen. At a minimum, I would expect an armband to HOLD your phone until you manually remove it, especially if its going to be used during exercise (moving around a lot)."
0,The belt clip broke after a week of use.
1,"Great product, GREAT experience!"
1,Good for short term use but will not last long if used every day
-1,"Does not work at all. Went to a water park and put all my things in there, from cell phone to money. Everything got wet. Thank goodness my phone didn't get damaged because that would have been a big problem."
1,"The box is amazing 2.0 charging is perfect , but the cable , not so much. After the first 2 days , so 2-4 charges in , it stopped fitting into my phone. It fits in , but falls right out , as if what should be holding it into place broke. I really want to blame my phone , mostly do , but still the durability factor of the cable isn't the best. So for the box 5/5 , cable 2/5"
1,This case is great
0,"The product installation was flawless and easy and withstands fingerprints and the like. I do like it, unfortunately one corner in the lower right hand side has broken off, I just noticed today so I'm going to have to order a new one. :( other wise a lovely and easy to use product."
1,I have bought several of you screen protectors and they are the best.
1,Works very well for a quick and easy sound system. Can worknfor any application. Have had it almost 2 months and works excellent. Several friends are buying one for there utv's & atv's.
1,"I have never had any lucky with these screen protectors, always bubbles, always aligned incorrectly, etc. I did not have much luck with this one either, but I chalk this up to user error. The great thing about these protectors is that it comes with THREE protectors. So if you mess up the first one, you still have 2 others to try and get it right. It also comes with a great full size microfiber cleaning cloth as well. So these are great bonus for the great price you are paying.<br /><br />It says bubble free, but when I tried to put this on the first time, I had a ton of bubbles. I have not yet tried the other two protectors yet, so I am hoping by the third try I will get it right. I also had a tiny hair that somehow found its way between the phone screen and the protector, so that drove me nuts, but again, this is all user error.<br /><br />I recommend watching the instructional video that they publish and to put apply the protector in an area that is dust and hair free, or as close as you can get to an environment like that."
1,"Excellent, great look but really protective also"
1,"*I received this product for free solely for the purpose of testing and reviewing this product. All unbiased opinions are my own.<br /><br />With this case, I now have convenience, and great protection all in one case. The wallet comes handy to store a credit card, while keeping the case thin. The only downside is, it holds only one card, and that may be a problem for some people. It also does not hold cash, which is another downside.<br /><br />The case itself is really tough. It is only made with 2 pieces, a hard outside and a softer inside, which are stuck together and make the case extremely shockproof. Pressing the buttons require a little more work, but not an extreme amount of pressure. The only thing that irritates me is that the volume on/off switch is recessed in the case, so you have to stick your finger all the way inside to access the switch. Good luck if you have grown fingers and little nails.<br /><br />Overall, I only took off a star for all the disadvantages, but I feel that the main points have been said in helping you find your next case for your iPhone 6 Plus."
-1,Bad case. The case kept coming out for no reason. And I  can't return it according to the seller. Waste of my money.
1,Works very well
0,"These headsets were great out of the box and had lots of sound bumping out of it.  I was surprised at how good these headphones were when I first used them and I had used them for my workouts.  I didn't do anything terribly intensive just jump roping, running, squats, burpees, etc.  The headset has great battery life - I used them about 2-3 times a week and only had to charge sporadically.  It would've been nice if there was a battery indicator of some sort.  My main gripe is that these things didn't last that long.  After about 4 months of use, the right earpiece no longer works."
1,This case fits great and protects the phone pretty well. We accidently ordered the wrong size of iPhone case and we were able to return with no hassle. We are very happy with the product and very happy with the service.
1,"It works, just not very strong, could have been made out of some harder plastic.  but like i said, it fits and works like a charm."
1,Locks securely into cup holder.  Very stable.  Does not allow my 10.1&#34; tablet to move on its own.
0,"I like the phone so far, the only problem is that the lock screen only works sometimes. I hate that about it because anyone who picks up my phone can access it."
1,"This phone case is great! I got it as a Christmas present and it has protected my phone amazingly well. I have dropped it a lot (hence my needing a high impact case) and I've dropped it on hard surfaces like concrete (even accidentally dropped it down a flight of stairs) and it has held up really well.  My only complaint is that the case cracked in the corner after about 6 months and now gapes open (but that's just as much my fault for dropping it so often). I've been lazy and haven't gotten a new case yet, but even with the break, it still protects my phone! I dropped it on my tile bathroom floor just a couple of days ago and even though the case actually flew apart my phone was still okay.  That's one bad thing that happens with this case - if it drops really hard the case will actually come open a little bit, but it's not a big deal, you just snap it back together and it's fine. I would definitely buy this case again!"
1,"Ok, so the original unit I got had some problems, I had trouble with ports randomly not charging a device, but I found I could swap two devices and charging would resume...  I posted my experience on Amazon.  Anker customer support actually contacted me by e-mail and phone, and sent a replacement unit.  Changing this to 5-star because their customer support is fantastic."
1,Five stars because it does exactly what it says it will do. I had to buy both this and the<br />Metra Reverse Wiring Harness 71-5600 as the previous owner of my truck was mentally ill when he wired his aftermarket deck. Great product.
1,I get s lot of compliments for my case.
0,they look good feel great in your ear sound quality is decent but the battery life sucks 6 months later and I'm buying a new pair of headphones and I bought two and they both went out they need to improve the batteries on them.
1,What can I say?  It works.
1,"Love this case for my phone.  My otter box was so bulky I didn't like it.  The service  was superb and fast, and the cost was terrific!!!"
1,"After taking a few days to research the current crop of smartwatches and reading what others had to say about their smartwatch experiences I chose to give the Moto 360 a try and I'm glad I did.  None of the currently available 1st generation watches are likely to fit everyone's tastes but I found the Moto 360 to be a beautiful and functional watch and as it is currently on sale its an exceptional value.  Out of the box the watch is easy to set up and prompts you to update to the latest version of the Android OS, Lollipop.  The watch paired easily with my Alcatel Tracfone and sends timely notifications and e-mails conveniently to my wrist.  I love it!  For those that feel variety is the spice of life you will find many watch faces available in the Google Play store.  Some folks seem overly concerned with battery life on these watches.  I put my watch In the wireless charger before I go to bed at night and its ready to go in the morning.  Even with ambient mode selected and with moderate use the charge lasts me all day.  When I bought this watch I wondered if I would find it useful but after wearing it for a week I know that if I didn't have it I'd miss it.  I'm happy with the Moto 360 and would buy it again without hesitation."
1,Everything is there except a manual.  This installation is tricky because the button transducers hang by thin plastic.  I severed the on/off button and don't think I can recover my phone.  The screen does work as before.  Showing the phone charging.
0,"I don't like how it does not have a solid protective front cover like the defender series.<br /><br />It just uses a stick on front cover that you can get from any store or company.<br /><br />I love otterbox, but would like to see better frontal protection on this model."
1,"I have only used it for a couple weeks.  It seems to hold a charge as well as the previous battery, though it does get hot as the previous one did.  My original battery swelled to twice its original size so I purchased this as a replacement"
1,Magnets are the same quality as the original ones that came with my imagnet phone cradle. Great deal for such a cheap price!
1,My wife likes this product a lot so far it has been perfectly protected! I would buy another one for a different phone version.
1,good item & good price
-1,Stopped working after about 5 hours of use. Clicking noise unable to read disc.
1,I love solar power and the ability to harness some of the sun's power to use for my devices. 
1,Great item!!
1,Works like a charm!
1,More than enough for the big three
1,Great
-1,2 of the 4 corners did not stick. This is a 2 pack and same thing happen with both. I still wore my watch with the screen protector on and dust got under the 2 corners and caused them to lift more and it just didn't last.
1,"Love it, the color is vibrant. I do wish that the inside color was a different color its very pink. I've had it for a few weeks and so far its holding up great. The cover is nice and snug the material is sturdy and the stitching is tight."
1,As expected
1,I could not use my smart phone with out one of these.  The best part is that they fit into the phone so you do not keep looking for it when you need it
-1,Did not fit my iPhone 5 as it said. Would not purchase
1,Awesome
1,"UPDATE!<br />---<br />Customer service contacted me and sent a new battery that had no issues. The battery IS compatible and so far has been good. Steller customer service.<br /><br />----<br />I had it for a week. On two occasions, my phone died when it was at 40% charge. Then it gives me an error message when I start charging. This is very unreliable. I am going to send this back."
-1,Not as I think
-1,Disappointed. I chose this one even though it was more expensive than some other options.<br />1. The glass was extremely thin.<br />2. It did not cover the entire watch face<br />3. It was chipped and then cracked by the following morning after applying it. I can't imagine what I bumped into that would have caused enough concern to check it.
1,Love it
1,This case is so great!!!! It is such a great quality phone case at a great price!!!

1,"I was quite excited to get a wireless speaker because I use one every morning at work.  I am currently lugging around a rather large speaker because most smaller ones aren't loud enough and/or sound rough.  I don't want to invest a lot of money into a speaker that may get broken at work.<br /><br />Upon arrival it was in a nice thick plastic case.  The accessories, a charging cable and a cable to plug a device directly in, were hidden beneath the speaker.  I immediately plugged it in to charge and was surprised to hear it announce that it was charging.  I like this feature because sometimes I don't know when a device has connected to my speaker.  It also announces when the battery is getting low.<br /><br />A nice feature is the ability to put an SD card in.  I don't always have the battery on my devices to use up so having a back up SD card filled with my music will come in handy.<br /><br />The speaker does get a little distorted when the volume is maxed out but taking it back down a bit helps.  I find this to happen on most speakers but it still is very loud for it's size.<br /><br />It was rather easy to use.  I didn't need to read the directions but the only downfall is that the battery only lasts about 3 hours.  That is a big difference to the 10 hours that it claims to last.  I don't mind on most days but if I have an overnight shift this speaker wont work for me.  The price point is exceptional for the quality and it's a durable speaker.<br /><br />I recieved this speaker in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,"I was really surprised how much better the tempered glass protector felt over a plastic protector. Since applying this product to my screen, my phone did take a spill and got a hairline crack in the middle, but the phone's screen is fine. The glass is much easier to apply as well than a plastic one and you don't have to worry about dust particles (you still want a clean surface of course) like you do with the plastic. Overall, I am very happy with the product and feel it's well worth the extra cost to protect your screen."
1,I didnt expect much when i ordered the case due to the low cost after receiving it I am very happy with the purchase.
1,"I just got my RAVPower 15W charger. It works great! I live in sunny Arizona so there is plenty of strong sun here. I'm also a big fan of using solar energy as much as possible! I wanted a solar charger that I could take on my kayak camping trips out in the wilderness. I have a small tablet, flashlights, and batteries that I want to keep charged during my trips. The RAVPower 15W seemed perfect for that situation. I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I ran a test of the RAVPower 15W charging my HP Stream 7 tablet. (You can see the pictures here.) I found the following result:<br /><br />Charging Time: 45-minutes starting @ 11:15am<br />Sunlight: Full sunlight in late August at 33 Degrees North - device was laid flat<br />Device: HP Stream 7 Tablet (turned off)<br />Battery Type: 3000 mAh Li-ion polymer<br />Charge Result: 57% to 90% battery<br />Battery Change: +33% (~1000 mAh in about 45 minutes)<br /><br />Here is my take from the device so far:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very fast charge for tablets and cellular devices<br />Better results than expected<br />Nicely Packaged<br />Material is high-quality<br />Well-built<br />Excellent customer support website with warranty registration<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />Charger gets VERY hot in the sun (maybe they should use white material for the cloth instead of black)?<br />Make sure you cover the device you are charging to protect from sun.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed with this charger. For less than $50 I have a great power source for my kayak camping trips!"
1,"Works well, but key hole is small"
1,This is a fantastic external charger it charges my Samsung Galaxy S4 very fast. I highly recommend it.
-1,It was horrible it has all type factory faults will never purchase another phone ever again
1,Cool colors for my S6 Edge. On time delivery. Product description very accurate.
1,The best service and best quality
1,"Reliable adhesion to the windshield, different angels for display. Like it!"
-1,I have had these cables for about a month with normal usage and one works while the other barely connects. 2 stars for one still working. Cannot return since it was a third party seller.
-1,"Have had tech Armor covers for other phones and loved them.  This cover installed well, but when I put the case on it started to loosen at the bottom edges.  I've only had the cover for 2 weeks and yesterday the bottom shattered.  This was with normal use.  I had not dropped or bumped the phone.  The case is a slim Vena case, but must have caused pressure to the edges of the curvature, to cause the break.  No wonder tech Armor will not warrant this cover as they do the others.  I will buy a different brand that is not edge to edge.  The case will protect the edges anyhow, so probably don't need entire face covered anyhow."
1,My son loves it
1,"Looking for a protective case for the Ultimate 2 is not disappointing at all for the many styles that are available from several different suppliers who have just about COVERED all possibilities in how to protect this phone. ICE-CLEAR even offers several different two-piece hard or some soft rubber styles, and this slip-cover style made of one piece of soft silicone rubber probably offers the least amount of protection out of all of them. But it is not without its own merits. I particularly like the ability to quickly remove the cover so I can slip the phone onto an old desktop charger purchased for a GS3 that I don't use any more. Concerns regarding protection from dropping the phone are rather nil for me since I seldom ever carry a phone with me, and in all this time have only dropped two phones, both times the impact of the fall being broken when hitting my foot and then sliding harmlessly to the floor. Both of those phones were wearing silicone rubber covers similar to this one, but of better quality and not so easy to remove as this one. I would still think in the same situation this ICE-CLEAR cover would remain in place during a fall, thus helping to prevent the phone from splitting into a thousand pieces that scatter into tight and inaccessible places. So don't expect that this cover will offer any protection other than that. ICE-CLEAR even throws in a protective screen shield and a metallic blue stylus, both of which I didn't need. But as is, it works just fine for me because this case provides a more positive grip whenever I'm holding the phone."
1,"I love this case, does it come in other colors?"
1,Like this case!
-1,Stopped taking a charge after 8 months. Now it's just a paper weight. Waste of money. Don't buy.
1,Lovee it!! 5 Star rating
-1,Garbage case. Phone fell out twice!<br />I returned it before it broke my phone
1,this is great
1,Overall the case is pretty good quality<br /><br />It doesn't perfectly fit the standard droid turbo with a little headroom at the top. It also feels a bit slick which worries me sometimes because I feel like I am going to drop it.
1,This case looks great and my galaxy 6s edge fits perfectly!!
1,Perfect!  Thank you!
1,Holds the iPhone 6 plus perfectly.  It would work with many different cases too.  Worth every penny!
1,this worked as it said its a cute plastic thing it looks cheap but did work so I'm happy
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
-1,"Spent hours and hours researching slim wallet cases for my new Iphone 6 and decided on this one.  Was particularly excited because it had a gold color option.  Alas, many of the reviews were true about the sliding door being difficult to open.  I had to push on the door so hard to open it, I thought I was going to break my phone.  I even gave it a try for a 2-3 days hoping it would loosen up and it didn't.  Returned it and now I'm back to trying out a few other case options."
1,great
1,Works
1,Protect your iPhone at all costs! Lol!! It makes the phone seem a bit bulky but worth getting. Matches the color of phone exactly.
1,"Love it, and it's easy to use."
1,I love this case.  This the 2nd one I have.  1st was for my note 4 and now for my note 5.
1,"I love this phone case, so smooth!"
0,"The text feature has no instructions in the manual. You will need to download MotoSpeak  to get it to work. It will verbally read the incoming text weather you have the headset on or not. You can turn the app off if you want, which I do if I am not wearing the headset. The big disappointment to me was it will receive the text but you cannot send a text. The headset itself is pretty good. Background noise does not interfere with your call as much as others I have used."
0,Bubbles formed and can't seem to get out
-1,"[[ASIN:B00Y9WQM6G Mpow Streambot Trapezoid 3.5mm In-car FM Transmitter Radio Adapter for iPhone 6 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 5G 4S 4 3GS 3G Galaxsy S6 S6 Edge S5 S4 S3 Note 4 3 2,HTC One M8 / M7 / Mini]]<br />It reproduces mono sound that seems comming from distance. I'll have to get a different product of better quality.It's not worth for most of us who are used to now of stereo sound."
0,Purchased for two Nexus 6's.  A bit small and doesn't quite make it to screen edges. One shattered after several weeks starting at the edge for no obvious cause.
1,"Was not cheap made and I was expecting it to be because of the price. Overall super cute, great material and worth it!"
-1,One of the three cables already stopped working and iPhone message says that the cable is not certified... Do not buy this brand  Updating 09/10/2015 - 2 of the three cables have failed. Don't waste your time or money on these. They are obviously NOT CERTIFIED or just CERTIFIED TO FAIL!!!!!!!
1,Everybody thinks it is a book! I love how solid it is around my Surface Pro. I also like how it hides the fact that I am caring a computer.
1,Need one for my AssendMate 4
1,"Works great, simple to install.  Just take your time and watch the video."
1,Good value for the price. Protects the phone o.k. I've already dropped it and it stayed in the case. Easy to access the buttons and the charging cover. I like it.
-1,"DONT BUY THIS CASE ON AMAZON!!! Buy it from the Apple Store. I bought this case from the Apple Store and it was great, very protective. But when I bought this from Amazon it was a cheap flimsy Chinese knock off. It's not the real thing!!!!"
1,IPhone 6 fits good  everything is working good so far but only have had it a week  armbands a little small could be a little bit bigger but it's working for me  and I'm not a very big guy
1,"This phone case is really handy.  It's perfect for carrying your phone, debit/credit card, driver's license, and money without having to take your whole purse.  It has a small hole in the top corner that you can attach the wrist loop to.  It works just fine without it too.  It fits the iPhone 6 Plus perfectly.  The phone isn't loose and all the holes line up well.  The card slots hold my cards securely too.  The case closes over the phone and has a magnetic strap to keep it closed.  This case is great for anyone on the go.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review."
1,"I LOVE this screen protector. I recommend buying two of them. I drop my phone a LOT and actually I'm on my second one. The one I have on my phone now has a crack all the way through it from me dropping it but it's barely noticeable so I haven't replaced it yet. I drop my phone almost once a day and it never cracks any more and my screen is still perfect. I've never had a screen last this long. The screen protector is also totally unnoticeable when it's placed correctly. It goes on easily with no bubbles, and you literally can't feel or see that it's there once it's on. I would buy this product over and over again in lieu of a phone case."
1,If you want to have your iphone safe just use a screen protector! My phone has dropped many times and with the glass it everything alright..
-1,"I purchased two of these, one for each car.  Unfortunately, the magnet does not seem to be strong enough to hold a phone steady.  In portrait mode it works decently well, but will eventually pull to the bottom of the ball.  This mount will not work in landscape mode with either of my phones (Samsung s6, note 4).  When trying landscape, the weight of the phone rotates it.  On a positive note, I had no problem getting the ball to stick in either vehicle."
1,Everything oke
1,"Very convenient.  Best professional packaging I have seen in a long time.  I am very pleased with this product - it is clean, attractive and works beautifully!"
1,Bought these to go with a new iPad. My grandma prefers them to her finger. Worked as she needed them to.
1,Works to quick charge a phone.
1,"I used this Ram Mount yesterday for the first time. It works really well in the car. I drove on a washboarded dirt road and despite the high vibration, the phone stayed in its place. Also, the mount will work with a variety of phones which is nice. Good versatile design that works."
1,Works well
1,Arrive on time.<br />Very Happy.<br />I Put myself in my phone and everything is perfect.<br />Tks...
-1,I would not recommend this protector to anyone who wants a protector that covers the entire screen area. There are gaps on both sides of the screen because the protector is too small. I have attached pictures showing the issue.
1,"Cheap, nice, works."
1,Works fine.
1,"I have only used this once, but it's a perfect fit for the LG Ultimate 2. It gives a perfect grip when on the phone and it looks nice too."
-1,"I bought this and it doesn't even turn on.  5 solid blue lights when it's plugged into the charger, but NOTHING.  I can't even charge a cell phone with it, let alone start a car!!!"
1,"So far, so good.  When I go on daily bike rides, I make sure I keep this in the car in case I need to recharge any of my phones or accessories while I am away from a power source.  I can charge items a few times before this battery pack needs a recharge.  Time will tell in regards to durability but so far, it is working nicely.  I am actually using it a lot more than I thought I would."
1,"Very nice portable battery with a sleek design. I take it with me almost everything I go. I have a 6 plus so this is a must + if you're a heavy user like me, you'll definitely need one. Great price and way more powerful than battery case."
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
1,Great product
1,Came in on time and looks fantastic!
1,"This is an awesome device for the price I paid! I previously purchased a more expensive one & it didn't work at all, yet this one really owns up to its description, it works! Not to mention that you can charge 2 gadgets at the same time, I love it!!!!"
0,"Not too bad. Definitely louder than phone speaker alone, but not really too impressive."
0,"This is OK when i go running, but sometimes it feels like its not super secure on my arm. The phone is EXTREMELY secure feeling in the case, but it's not really comfortable."
1,"Short:<br />Charges my Note5 fairly quickly, though not as quickly as a Fast Charge charger. It's cheaper than most others and works well.<br /><br />Long:<br />Charges my Samsung Galaxy Note5 just fine and the pad is almost exactly the same size, which makes alignment quick and easy - just set the phone down and squeeze the sides / line up the bottom edge.<br /><br />Sitting with the charging pad about 3 ft from me, I can hear a quiet, steady 2 bps (beats per second) high-pitched noise - surely the electronics &#34;pinging&#34; for device discovery to begin charging. While audible, it is quiet, steady, and is a tone that doesn't cause me any annoyance.. after a while, I forget it's there, like a fan or other white noise. I probably wouldn't sleep with it on a nightstand next to my bed, but any other use shouldn't be problematic.<br /><br />It's extremely light, which isn't necessarily a good thing. I might prefer some more weight to help anchor the pad in place. The bottom has four tiny corner bumps and being made of relatively cheap materials, the pad isn't absolutely perfectly shaped, so it wobbles from corner to corner on a flat surface ever so slightly. Both of these points are minor and essentially inconsequential.<br /><br />The top isn't non-slip like some others. There's no rubber or sticky silicone on top. That said, I've had no problems and it actually turns out to be a good thing given the way I align my phone as described above. Easy sliding means I can quickly lay my phone down and squeeze the sides to align, as opposed to have to line it up correctly prior to setting it down.<br /><br />The LED is on the &#34;front side&#34; (the bottom, i.e. the side of the pad that faces you) and is bright enough to see, but small enough that it's not obnoxious. It's a steady read and turns steady green when charging. When my Note5 is fully charged, the charging pad remains in charge mode with a green LED. Not a real problem, just pointing out it's not as sophisticated as some of the other chargers available.<br /><br />It charges my Note5 about half as quickly as Samsung's provided Fast Charge wired charger, which is to say this pad actually charges quite quickly compared to what I'd expect for wireless charging. I just set my phone down now: at 65% battery, the phone estimates 60 minutes to 100%. That would be roughly just under 3 hours to go from 0% to 100% if the curve were linear. Samsung's own Fast Charge Wireless Charger claims 0% to 100% in 2 hours, so given that the TechMatte pad is &#34;normal&#34; wireless charging, 3 hours ain't bad at all."
1,Wife loved it a stylish but suttle replacement for the OEM option.  Ordered second one for other family member.<br /><br />Same sizes and quality as original band.
-1,"It's a cute case, but when I received it in the mail the gold part of the phone case was not attached  to case. It's cheaply made and doesn't fit completely on one side of phone. Company reached out to me for feedback and told them same story. No one responded, not even for an apology. Needless to say I will not buying any future purchases with this company."
1,"Great case, my daughter loves it!"
1,"Excellent battery replacement, worked very well."
0,Worked well for a few weeks. Now it doesn't hold anything. But I got use out of it for a few rides at least.<br />Perfect idea for geocaching via bike.
1,She loves it. She did say that it required her to remove the back of the phone - then it snapped in.  I think that should be noted on its details
-1,"Bluetooth keeps disconnecting,"
1,I love this ipod cover.  It snaps shut and fits perfectly. It is small and secure.
1,Bought this case for my friend and she absolutely adores it. Great contrast to her black galaxy.
1,Love it! Extremely recommended.
1,"Battery life is great with this product. Doesn't take forever to charge like previous products I have had, and will last all day with HEAVY use. I can get 10-12 hours screen on time with this in a single day.<br /><br />The back the comes with this does feel a little cheap and that's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. It can pop off really easy if you're not careful. It does make your phone about 3/4 inch thick and significantly heavier, but it's a good balance between the smaller capacity batteries and the REALLY big ones."
1,I like it
0,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
1,Great!
1,Works great
1,Went on pretty well but I should have purchased the one with the replacement home button.
1,thes good
1,"This is one of the nicest screen protectors I have ever seen. It is thin but thick enough for protection. It's not easily scratched and it fits like a snug. My sister who has a note made me give this to her. I guess she needs it as much as she drops her phone lol. When we opened the box, it was so nice and sophisticated in the box. It was well packaged and it is very sleek looking. It comes with a alcohol pad and a cleaning cloth. Everything you need to get you started. I ran my fingernail across the screen to see if anything would pick up and NADA...that was nice to me but the best thing of all, no air bubbles. I have air bubbles and there's no chance of any getting inside. I am very pleased. I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review at a discounted rate. I would gladly recommend this product. Great Great Great screen protector. Great investment!!"
0,comes apart to easy
0,"It's kind of bulky, but very protective and awesome design!"
-1,"Really cute case, but it was super cheap looking, and it would not close correctly. Definitely would not stay on phone and/or protect it."
1,Love how it fits the phone
1,Have a few of these. They are much sturdier than the iPhone cabels and last much longer
1,"Perfect fit, and it comes with a anti scratch film. You can also make and cut your own design."
1,fits right
1,durable.  doesn't peel.  good protection.
1,Holds all my credit cards and more. Looks great too!
1,Great product!
1,best charger cables I've ever purchased. Charges phones quickly and is very durable. I will buy more of these soon.
1,"Nice compact charger for Apple watch. Watch cradles well and really can't fall out due to design & MAGNETIC watch charger hold watch in place. There's really not much you can say about the simple concept charger, SIMPLE &  works well."
1,Love it great phone!!
-1,Was very glitchy and I had to return it
1,Arrived quickly. Perfect.  No need to say more.
1,"Excellent case. I was a bit puzzled at first how to open it, so a little slip of paper saying &#34;push&#34; may have helped! But so far, ii has been great. Tough, good looking and strong!"
1,It works great.  So nice to have a longer cord.
1,Very bulky but fits well.
1,Fits perfectly. Good grip.
0,"Runs small ... probably great for women, but for an average sized male it will barely fit.  Also, there is no way to control volume, etc. when wearing it.  My last arm band was made out of a silicon rubber and it had preformed impressions for volume control, etc.<br /><br />This product isn't bad ... it's just not that good, either.  It provides decent weather protection."
1,Versityle Selfie Stick with multiple options for hieght standalone and mobility modes
1,Excellent value for the money
1,"They are cables, and they work. :)  They feel premium not sure what else to say."
1,thanks
1,Great case works like it should. Only con was that there was plastic I the way for the charger to fit. Fixed it with an exact o knife and works great
1,Good
1,I have a few of these and they are rugged and good quality cables.
1,love it
-1,"The 1 star rating is because of the poor battery life.  As others have mentioned in their reviews, the batter will drain in 3-4 hours even without use.  If you use, it will drain even quicker.  I also have had trouble making calls--sometimes takes 3-4 tries to connect a call.  I've had several episodes where my phone just dropped the call in the middle of a conversation(can be extremely annoying).  On the plus side, for a prepaid phone it surfs the net reasonably well; it's do-able.  Overall, very disappointed."
1,Nice and durable
-1,"Let's start with the packaging - a tin, sliding case, lots of plastic, and cushioning wrap for something that doesn't break. It's not &#34;glass&#34; in the regular sense. It feels like plastic. That's not why I sent it back. Mine was cut a fraction too small, so that if one side lined up, the other side had a thin strip of screen exposed. It shows up fingerprints badly as well. I'm returning it and going back to thin, plastic film covers. I had one for my iPhone 5c and never had to use the other three sheets for almost two years."
1,"Good product, fast shipping"
1,I use it to power my GPS and it works beautifully. My old one would die after about 4 or 5 hours. This one will go for 2 or 3 days without recharging. Great product.
1,Needed them and they arrived fast
1,Love and keeping it
1,"Very timely delivery and exactly what I needed. The best part? The very next day after I put it on my brand new iPhone 6, I absently left it on the hood of my car and drove off. After realizing it, I drove back and another car was parked where I previously was. For the amazing part.... My phone was face-down and under the tire of an SUV!!!! The only thing that happened was the plastic screen protector I had on it was slightly cracked. That is it! I have always swore by OtterBox's and now I am both awed and a lifetime user."
1,Good!
1,Love the case. Durable nice and strudy
-1,Was disappointed when they wouldn't connect with Siri on my phone.
1,Great product for getting a nice clean signal to your amp. I especially like the adjustable gain knobs.
1,Good

1,Great for Run
1,2nd one great stuff
1,Holds a charge great

-1,"My cable, when connected to an iPad or iPhone it clicks endlessly at times. It requires that the label face front, otherwise it will not change. Garbage Do Not Buy!"
1,These are AMAZING. First off they use a micro USB as a charger so I can charge them on the way to the gym with my car charger that I use for my phone. They also charge really quickly and will last 8 hours. I even like the voice because it let's me know when they are actually totally off. LOVE THEM. GREAT VALUE!
-1,"I am disappointed, frustrated, and upset!  I watched the getting started videos repeatedly and had no trouble syncing the Myo.  However, it has not responded to any of the gestures. I am hugely disappointed because I ordered it to wow the audience for a major presentation. It is totally useless! I contacted tech support via email as there is no phone number and they were super slow to respond and still have not offered to troubleshoot or information on returning it!!!!! The Myo and tech support in my experience was an epic failure! Until they get the kinks out and provide better tech support, buy a traditional presentation remote and save your money."
1,I couldn't get this charger to put my note edge in fast charging mode until I Googled and realized you have to make sure cord snaps into charger (push hard). It was charging but not in fast charging mode until that point. Now it's perfect!
0,Good thank
0,"Case is good but has no grips on the side, therefore is slides out of your fingers easily."
1,Great solid mount in our lexus is350 also holds a note 4 in a shock absorption case well designed!
-1,Unit did not work (would not charge) out of the box.
1,"Awesome, quick charger works just like the one that came with my phone for home charging.  Galaxy S6 Edge.  Super fast free delivery, arrived earlier than estimated time."
1,Great case!
1,Perfect fit
1,"I wish I had bought this sooner.  The Anker Charging Station has done an excellent job of reducing the clutter on my night stand. I currently have it charging an IPad 2, Kindle Fire, IPhone 6, IPhone 5, and an external battery.<br /><br />The included 40 watt - 5 port charger matches the charging station and does an excellent job.  This is my second Anker charger and I am very happy with the quality of these devices.<br /><br />So far I have only 2 complaints:<br />1. The slot furthest to the front is wider than the two behind it.  I wish this was reversed as it would be easier to charge the iPad in a thick case and be able to access smaller devices if it was located in the back.<br /><br />2. I wish that they offered this in black."
1,Love it
1,Perfect for 500 watt amp. No more over heating wire
-1,"I'm sure the speaker would work great if it was the one that fit my phone.  The speaker in the picture is not the same speaker that I received.  The speaker I received has a thin plastic piece sticking up about 1/2&#34; on the left side.  (outside of speaker facing you).  I did see the speaker I received in pictures from other companies.  If you need this speaker, cross your fingers and order.  I wasn't upset about the price, so I'm not going through the trouble of returning it.  I'm more aggravated that I have to wait another month for another speaker from a different company.<br />I did get this speaker about a week before expected date.  Good luck!"
1,Great wire I am using mine to put with my portable charger battery pack.<br />Works great no problems so far.
1,"I have had the adapter for 5 days...<br />Paired, played, talked, and tethered with this adapter 3 ways to Sunday.<br />Besides the bad reviews...(It breaks, muffled sound, repairing, or it just plain stops working) at this point I can say that it is worth a 3-4 star rating.  Lets be honest with each other....<br />There are only a few reasons why you are reading any of these reviews for a Bluetooth receiver.<br />1. You are too broke (like me) to buy a newer car that has Bluetooth capabilities.<br />2. You are too cheap (like me) to buy a newer car or stereo that has Bluetooth features.<br />3. You are looking to rid yourself of cords and use that fancy smartphone of yours (like me).<br /><br />I have two cars (that are paid off...did I say that I was smart and cheap?)<br />04 Honda Accord with a broken CD player (who uses those anymore huh?) no AUX, and no USB.<br />04 Toyota Carola with tape deck (who even has tapes anymore huh?) no AUX, and no USB. Been using a AUX Cassette Adapters for any phone that has an AUX."
-1,The reason I gave this such a low review is for a major flaw that it has. The charging cable does not line up flat with the hole where the watch rests. This decreases the magnetic connection strength and ultimately causes the watch to fall off and lose its charge.
1,Fit my new phone perfectly! I've had it a couple of months now and it has performed exactly as described. I am 100% happy with my purchase.
1,"Off to a strong start.  Only had this a week with light use, but my initial impressions are positive.  For the price point seems well enough made.  I like the metal rotating belt clasp, hope it stronger than plastic clips, which can be the weak link in other holster type products.  I will update in the future if my opinion changes.  Main reason for writing a quick review is just to let people know that my Galaxy S6 with a Spigen Slim Armor case fits perfectly, maybe a touch tight, but I think the holster may stretch a bit over time and honestly even if it doesn't its not so tight that it can't be used, but takes a bit more force to pull it out, not a big deal, don't let that dissuade you from buying this case.  Between the case and holster this very expensive phone investment should be a safe as I can make it."
1,Love it!
-1,"Doesn't hold a charge for Long..  When I charge it all day, then it doesn't last 2 hours and it won't hold a charge on stand by. Yes it works but I don't recommend it."
1,The battery bank charges really fast and it charges my cell phone really fast too
1,Great screen saver and easy install.
-1,you need to have a case for the edge plus !
1,Great price. Prompt shipping.
1,I've dropped my phone a few time snow and it's held up like a champ.  Now I can be clumsy and not feel guilty.
1,Good product.
1,This case is amazing. Saves my phone with every drop haha! Lasts for a long time.
1,"As someone already mentioned, this case is so slim and matches the gold color of my gold Edge+ so perfectly that it's difficult to tell that it even has a case on it.  Well done!"
1,Great
1,This product is awesome! Charges all of my devices very fast. I love it!
1,Just what I was looking for
1,My sister in law loves this!
1,bulky and unfashionable but the best call quality on the market.
-1,"Left Speaker was Buzzy at loud volume, and Buttons failed first day, Returned after less than an 2 hours use... Very Bad Build Quality on a decent design..."
1,Great screen protector!
1,Wasn't expecting much from this cheap amp but it hits pretty hard!  Right now I'm just using it to drive one 8&#34; Kicker sub and it more than does the job.  In case no one else has mentioned it here - in order for the little remote to work you have to use this amp on the low-pass setting.  Cheers.
0,"I bought these for my boyfriend. If he is somewhere with background noise, I can hear it. It is very annoying."
0,"I like it, although when I turn my head it interrupts the music"
1,"Amazing!  The case it very sturdy feeling right off the bat.  The screen protectors go right on beautifully and easily, and the case has incredible fit and finish. The case removes the issue of the phone being too slippery as well. This is probably the best case that I've used in 10 years of running smart phones. The note 5 is a great phone that deserves a great case. Excellent value."
1,"Absolutely LOVE these.  Not only are they weight-sensitive on-off, they are great for an added boost to the height of the seat in winter to see better. LOVE 'em!"
-1,Does not work with my radio. Gives me call numbers for the radio that the radio does not recognize. Completely useless device!
1,Fits and protects peferctly
1,"Are you kidding me?!?!!! I couldn't pass this up!  I can charge, sync and use the cord for a kickstand to watch videos. Throw in the discount I got and call me one happy guy!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00SNVC416 LABC - Cable & Ultra Protection Case - Apple Certified MFi Lightning Cable in Case - iPhone 6]]"
1,really nice layout - so many of the outlets are configured so that you can't get to the usb outlets. comes with adapters for different phones
1,:) Great screen protectors.
-1,did not fit on boat returned
1,really like them have given a lot to friends
1,Great product - and price was good
1,"I purchased this to make nail polishes, and it works GREAT!!!!! It's just the right size for nail polish bottles."
1,Very nice soundbot
1,Its easy to use and usable.
1,Works as advertised.
1,Works better then I thought! The voice offers so many tip durning the directs
0,"Good bluetooth headset for the price I paid on Amazon ($20), but not what's Alec in the stores  ($100+) Since this is a headset made for the S5/Note 4, I thought it would do more voice operation to control my phone.  The only thing it does is auto stops/plays music when you connect/seperate the two magnet earbud pieces together.  This is a nice option, but I wouldn't pay hundred just for that.  Sound quality is ok."
1,Functionality is great followed by a great design. Card slots are a little tight at first so they need to be broken in. Some stitching is a little weak but doesn't cause any problems. Highly recommended
-1,"This a restructure of Samsung Note 4 instead of a new model.<br /><br />The reason this phone got a 2-star instead of 1-star was that it had great QHD display and slightly better rear camera. However three great features were taken away from the previous model.<br /><br />1. No removable battery, which meant once your phone's battery died in two years or less, your phone became useless unless you find a technician to replace a new battery for extra $100 or more.<br /><br />2. No memory card upgrade, which meant you have to spend $100 more to upgrade from 32 GB to 64 GB. In contrast, in Note 4, you could upgrade to 64 GB for $15 with a mini memory card on Amazon.<br /><br />3. Shorter battery life, since the phone's new features used more battery than previous models.<br /><br />With these disadvantages, this phone is worth no more than $250 with no carrier contract."
1,Very sturdy
1,"This is completely clear so you can see your phone through it. It does not block any of the ports and all the openings line up perfectly, which is a plus. This snaps on easily and isn't bulky. It basically fits your phone like a glove. I really like clear cases because I can customize them to however I like. It goes on quickly & seems to be moderately durable. I'm not willing to drop my expensive phone to test out the case to find out.<br /><br />I received this product for free or for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion"
-1,Don't buy. Nonexistent customer service. Bought in July 2015 and used  3 times. Only use when at beach.  The cover for charging port fell off and small metal post that supposedly secures the cover was lost. Tried to return to Amazon but beyond their return window. Case has 1 year warranty for return but can not find manufacturer contact information despite thorough web search.
-1,"The texture of the case is nice and firm, a good feeling. but that&#34;s it. the case gives the phone no protection what so ever.<br />My son dropped his phone getting out of the truck, into a pebble garden. A PEBBLE GARDEN, and the screen cracked.<br />If you want this case for looks then get it. but if you want protection, find something else."
1,I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. It is a nice case and good quality but not very protective. It basically decorates your phone. It's nice for that purpose
-1,"it does not work well, very poor quality, product already returned."
1,It was great and I loved it
-1,"Ordered 3, 1 worked."
1,"I got this to review, and I requested with a friend in mind. I gave it to him and he loves it! He said the only thing he'd change is at the bottom where you charge your phone it's rubber. He said he would have preferred it hard cassed all around.<br /><br />But he was over all happy'"
1,"great case, has a manly matte black finish !"
1,I love the design just not sure how long it will last
-1,"I bought 3 of these because through a series of unfortunate events I lost/broke my other cables. I use one at my bedside and it works if i don't touch the phone. If I pick up the phone it starts buzzing on and off like it is dancing in my hand. The same happens with the one I use in my car. And the one I use at work. All three work most of the time, but if touch the cord any it disconnects and reconnects.... so I am just waiting for the day when these cords don't reconnect anymore..."
0,It's okay. It started chipping the next day
1,"Great Quality Product. Case fits like a glove. Not bulky like those Fisher Price looking Otter Box Cases! If you don't work in construction or jump out planes,then this case is for you.  It's very  similar to my Spigen Neo Hybrid Case for my Samsung Note 3! Note: Spigen Cases are nice cases as well. VERUS design Lab you have just won yourself a loyal customer. Really like the attention to detail, great craftsmanship, superb work! Nice snug fit, doesn't make my phone feel bulky at all. Thank you VERUS design Labs!  👍👍 😉👊"
-1,"no, no impact at all after I installed this filter<br />useless for my car."
1,I bought this for my wife and she loves it.
1,"Finally, a GPS mount that really works !"
1,Sturdy cable works nicely
1,So nice and pretty too.
0,"I absolutely loved it, BUT after the first time I dropped my phone the top of hard case part broke. Also The back design started pealing after two weeks. :("
1,"High quality, protective cover. Very convenient for carrying along ID, etc. Love it!"
0,"Nice case, fits great."
1,Yes it meet my expectations. Thanks
1,"Wow, amazing guys it can't be better then this. If you have a S6 edge and looking for a screen protector plz don't waste your time just buy this. Thanks a lot for such a product"
1,I like this product but i think that the cable are a little thin for a dash board camera
-1,"Everything about using these screen protectors was disappointing.  I've used several other brands in the past, and never had the problems I've had with this one.  The cloth that came with this was the lintiest (if that's a word) cloth I've ever used.  This is the only screen protector I've used where my phone always looks filthy.  And it's not just the fingerprints (each one stays forever); it just looks dirty.  I haven't had any problems with it sticking like some others have mentioned.  It just never applied well and it's useless to me because the screen looks like such a mess all the time."
1,It worked fine
1,Have a Galaxy Note4 and after ready some of the reviews was afraid it wouldnt fit when it was in the case. Pleased to say it fits just fine. Makes it easy to position so map applications are easily viewable at a glance
-1,"What a great idea, the Pyle PLCM7200 Backup Camera & Rearview Monitor Parking Reverse System.<br />My truck has a built in reverse camera which is dead on for hooking up the trailer.<br />The trailer has a 350 gallon water tank and is wider than the truck so backing was a hit and miss gamble on narrow<br />mountain roads.<br />I bought and installed the Pyle 7200 on the back of the trailer and tested it out in the yard, it worked perfectly.<br />Not needing to make a water run, I left it parked for several weeks. During that time it rained several times.<br />When I needed water I hooked the trailer up and was off to get water. I couldn’t see a thing behind the trailer.<br />When I examined the Pyle 7200 I found it nearly filled with water from normal rain. I removed the camera, dried it out,<br />sealed it  with gasket goop and it worked again but only until it warmed up, creating a condensation over the lens.<br />It does that every time I want to use it now. I would like to replace it with another that has never been wet, or even another<br />12 volt camera that was made to be outdoors. You would think a backup camera would be weather proofed for outdoor use.<br />THL"
1,none
1,Everything is alright. I like the phone and the back leather. Also nice camera
-1,Did not work on my Galaxy S6
1,Everything was as promised.  Thanks!
1,Flexibility plus! Now I won't have to figure out how to plug in all the different chargers. And it has enough juice for anything I throw at it.
0,Not enough protection for screen.
-1,Very nice case but did not fit my cellular.
1,Came in super fast looks brand-new for other viewers you could come in a Ziploc baggie but it's brand-new it's awesome .<br /><br />They shipped really fast I hope they ship all the time out this fast thank you
0,This item got mixed reviews and I really hesitated on buying it because I was worried about what my experience would be.  I'm happy to say that I'm more than satisfied with my purchase.  I bought this for my 2013 BMW 335i xDrive and it fits perfectly behind the rear-view mirror (closer to the passenger side).  I bought a 10 foot USB Mini B cable to power it and I needed all 10 foot by the time I tucked it behind the roof/door panels.  Note that it does come with a 10 foot 12V car charger but I was already using the receptacle for something else and needed USB instead.  The instruction manual isn't great but I was able to figure out most of the functions by just playing with the buttons.  I bought a class 10 mini SD card (Sandisk Ultra) and have not had any issues.<br /><br />UPDATE: 01/27/2016 I'm now getting a &#34;Memory Error&#34; when trying to use the camera.  This worked fine for a long time so I'm a little annoyed that it is not working anymore.  I guess you get what you pay for.
1,I bought this for my husband because he's a truck driver and this headset is exactly what he needed; in case of emergencies of course..
1,Works great
-1,It ceaps on turning off when the bass hits
-1,I loved this case until a piece of the plastic case broke off. The plastic case broke in 2 places. It cracked at the earphone port and charging port. The gold coating is also rubbing off. This case is flimsy. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this. You are better off getting an all rubber case. Disappointed.
1,Used this to repair a cracked screen in a Asus Transformer T100. I've replaced a few screens before and this product is/was exactly what I needed. Put a line on both inner and outer edges and you are good to go. Always warm it a tad to seal the deal. Literally.
-1,dont stay on as well as i want and is cheaply made.
1,Would have been great if I would have paid attention and gotten one that fit my tablet. They don't make them for the LG7 yet 😔
1,great except how long it took
0,Pros: It was very comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Cons: ...SURPRISINGLY unreliable...<br /><br />Unfortunately I can't rate this any higher. Dropped connections to my Samsung Galaxy S3 after just a minute or two of talk time. Ended up throwing it in the electronics recycling at Best Buy...<br /><br />If you get a headset that WORKS...I'm sure it's great. I'm rating it 3 stars even though mine didn't work because a single star likely wouldn't be representative of anything other than just my experience this time around. It's got decent reviews otherwise.
1,I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Syncs perfect with your smart phone and looks like this watch costs me hundreds.  My husband is literally obsessed with his new gadget.
1,"I had never owned a battery case so I was very curious to how I would like it.  When it arrived I was very pleasantly surprised.  It is very easy to install in the case, very easy.  It fit my iPone 6 Plus perfectly. It adds some weight, which I expected, but not so much weight as to make the phone difficult to carry in my front pants pocket. I'm sitting here looking at the battery case, holding it in my hand and I honestly can't find anything wrong with it, it fits my needs perfectly.  The availability of the extra better charge has already come in more handy that I had anticipated. You will like the robust nature of its manufacture (its well made), the ease of use, and the appearance. Well worth the purchase!!"
-1,Was not appropriate for my needs
1,"WOW!  This is a spectacular high capacity portable charger.  It's an amazing 20,000 mAh and can charge your phone, ipad, kindle, computer or any other electronic device!  It has two dual charging capacities:  1 amp and 2 amp.  It can charge multiple devices without running out of juice.  I have used 8,000 mAh's before and it can charge my phone probably twice.  But I love that I can charge two devices at the same time and it is just as quick.  It does only come with one usb cord, but that's okay as I have plenty of usb cords and ac jacks.<br /><br />It is small enough to fit inside your briefcase or purse.  It is a bit heavier (almost one pound) and larger than my other chargers, but I gladly exchange the capacity of this one with my other smaller, less capacity portable chargers, despite its weight.  Taking this portable charger on my overseas trips will be an immeasurable benefit.  Even my other higher capacity chargers run out of juice if I am taking photos all day long with my phone with no opportunity to recharge.  There is also a neat little flashlight on the end of the battery pack.  You can use this flashlight to help plug in your electronic device in the dark - which helps immensely.  I highly recommend this charger for your portable needs!"
1,"Love simple sturdy, covers the  buttons but unlike other box it's thin enough that. I know I won't press extra hard"
1,Did the job
-1,Nah
1,"I love this holder! Secure and holds my phone very tight.  I have the Samsung Note 4 with the Otterbox case, so it's a large device - and this holds it perfectly."
1,"This is a great case, true it makes the sleek iPhone a little bulkier, but it is so practical and cool looking that none of that matters. The case can also double as a wallet, which I wouldn't do every day, because my wallet is stuffed with crap, but for going out it's perfect. You have your phone, cash, ATM card, ID and bus pass with you cleverly disguised as a little book. I put it in my front pocket which fits nicely and (I think) helps deter pickpockets. The material of the case feels great, the phone clips in easily and securely and the whole thing seems to protect the phone beautifully. It ships with a cloth to clean your phone (nice!) and a weird little stylus thing (meh). The price is right and I highly recommend it! I included a photo with my wallet for reference, my wallet is not included in the purchase."
1,"This product works exactly as advertised! It is the best solution for everyone's needs to if you're on the fence about it, just know that you won't be disappointed."
1,ok
1,This works well and has kept me charged up over some multi day hiking trips.  But for some reason recently just one charge of my iPhone drains the battery pack almost completely.  Not sure why that's happening.
0,Working fine for now
1,Love this item!!
1,Love it!
1,Works as it should.  No problems.
0,Amazing case ..very sturdy! Go for a darker color the cherry blossom stains easy!! I have yellow stains from I don't know how?
1,Great headphones.  So far the battery lasts a long time.  Sound is good for videos and music.
1,Looks good. Blue tooth is very good
1,I like it.
1,Very clear sound.
-1,I filled up the card slots with 6 cards and put phone in it and it wouldn't close. The magnet has now ripped off because I tried to stretch it a little and close it.
1,"great kit. I bought both the Metra and Schoche kits. Although the Metra kit had better plastic, the Scosche kit fit much better and allowed the head unit to come further forward. overall satisfactory for the price."
1,Nicer than pictured
-1,"I don't know what kind of a piece of junk they sent me, but I do not have a charging port and it will not pair with my iphone6.  I also have a little cord that plugs into a port on my phone, but that seems to do nothing.  I am very disappointed in this selfie stick."
1,Perfect replacement for the one I lost.  Thank you!
1,Great three in one charger.
-1,"US Cellular prepaid is just a sham.<br />They only activate over the phone or in person at one of their seven stores located in  Buttkeep Minnesota and AssherHat Iowa.<br /><br />They demand a credit check even acknowledging &#34;yepper, its a prepaid but I gotta check it&#34; and even with a 760 FICO score, still want a security deposit.<br /><br />These were brand new sealed phones from Amazon's stock, not &#34;Fulfilled by&#34;  not some toilet dropped wiped off brick from an Amazon Marketplace scammer but true, actual new phones and making them work is a fantasy."
1,I love the case and the shipping was very quick!
1,Awesome... very cool looking and sleek.. gets the job DONE!. .. a little heavy but that was expected.. will Def buy again if I need another
1,Just what my phone needed
1,A very useful product. I take it with me when I travel and it charges all my electronic devices.
1,So far so good. Hope it lasts
1,Having the place to keep debit/credit card and ID makes life so much easier. Love this case.
-1,Very happy
1,I use with two 8 inch in a ported box wired in 2 ohms. This makes it sound much much bigger. Amp never complains!
1,very good item good price too
0,I got these stylus's to use with my samsung tablet and found that they are very light weight so theywork at times and at times they do not. They do fit esily in my hand which makes them easy to hold and use as well. I say do the research and if these work with your smart device then good for you. They are nicely priced so they are a good deal to be had.
1,"Very satisfied. Fits snuggly, design in good condition, has not worn off."
-1,Doesn't work!
-1,"Bought it for an apple iPhone. for Virgin Mobile. Did not work, it was so frustrating that Virgin sent me a free sim card. Very bad experience."
-1,Piece of crap.  Already not working and I bought it 3 months ago.
1,Got it before actually  :) lol and it looks awesome on my galaxy! I bought it because Im majoring in forensics so I like that stuff.
1,"This is a cute power bank from Sentey. I got this in pink hoping to keep it away from my husband as he has took some of the other ones I had. It worked!<br /><br />This little power pack is not the slimmest thing, but I am still able to fit it and my lg acesss into my back pocket, though I do have to remove them before sitting down, where I  could normally leave my phone in my pocket. I got this hoping for something to easily put in my diaper bag and change my phone on day trips. This is light weight and fits nicely in a bag without taking up too much room or adding tons of extra weight!<br /><br />I love that this power pack also has a built in flashlight! Never know when your going to need one. Also I can change two devices at once, as long as I have my own cords. This power bank does have an on and off button and lights that help you to know how much charge is left in it.<br /><br />Overall this is a decent power bank and is nice to easily take on day trips. It seems to charge my phone about 2-3 times before dying. Considering my battery is 2440mAh and I'm generally using my phone while it's charging, I would say it puts out about what it's supposed to. This isn't something I would recommend if you needed long term and a fast change, but it is nice for when needed on a day out!<br /><br />I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
1,Works good and sound quality very good.
1,Love it!
-1,"This product does not fit the LG G4, which it is listed on Amazon under the search LG G4. When I received this cover in mail I opened it and realized it doesn't fit. I intended to return it but decided not to due to the fact it would of cost more for me to ship it back to Amazon and have a new one shipped to me. Extremely disappointed."
1,its great
-1,"Came scratched, doesn't stay on, not metal, hate it!"
1,I ordered these from BOOD. They came extremely fast and I received 6 instead of the 5 that was listed. They are quite a bit longer than the stock cord that the iPhone comes with (why doesn't Apple think to give longer cords?!) which helps with mobility while charging. I have only used one-- and I am hoping that it will work for a while. I will try to update this review once the first cord dies... Which hopefully won't be for a while!
1,Great price quality delivery
1,Works great.
-1,Unit failed after 13 months of very light use.  The output side does not supply enough voltage/current.  Devices connect to it will not charge showing the X sign over the battery icon.
1,"[[VIDEOID:95879b2fb18a0f936c31fdf7711179ba]]I have seen several type of these cases that have the kick out so you can stand up your iPhone 6 either horizontal or vertical but this one by Collen is far superior then others out there. The material and the construction are great quality and vibrant colors. The fit is perfect. The instructions did not state if you kept the two pieces together or not. We found it easier to separate the \\""gray\\"" hard backing from the silicone \\""green\\"" piece. As you can see in the video it is easy to install on your iPhone 6. All of the phone buttons work perfectly with the case on and it is very stylish. It does come in several different colors but I choose the green/gray since that is one of my husbands favorite colors. He drives a Jeep and there is a perfect spot to place his iPhone 6 with the kick stand horizontal so he can use his GPS in his Jeep it sits perfectly. He too is very impressed with the quality of this iPhone 6 case and he has used at least 10 different cases. I received this product for a discounted price for my unbiased and honest opinion."
1,Excellent
0,These headphones get the job done for a decent price. If you are buying them for the gym you may find them lacking in the low end. For running they are perfectly fine. They are light weight and they stay put.
1,"Like it a lot, but have to agree with an earlier reviewer who mentioned that the groove for propping up the tablet is a little too shallow to keep the tablet upright securely.  Minor point.  The stylus is handy at times."
1,Great
1,Worked nicely!!! Easy to use and well made. Just what I needed to install and after market radio.
1,"After some experimentation I'm finding that vertical, nylon holsters work best for me and this is an especially well made one.  The horizontal leather (or leather like) holsters I've purchased have fallen apart at the belt loops or elastic.  I didn't want the hook & loop closure  on this one but it is more secure and a good trade-off.  Plus my Galaxy S5 fits well even with a protective case on it."
0,"This product did fulfill the requirement of protecting the phone. However,  lacks ease of use while putting on and taking off. The top portion is made so thin and flimsy, that it broke after just 2 removals.  I was not impressed, but thankful after dropping the phone and the case held. If you are one to place a phone in its case and never take it out, it would work for you."
1,"Great product, got this for traveling when I need gps/waze in a rental car. Easy to put on and take off. Holds my phone very solid doesn't fly out and the whole piece stays on well. Would have given 5 stars but I can't get it to stick to dash board only the windshield ."
-1,"Save your money. The cut out does not match the Note 5. The sides are cut crooked, the top and botom is cut short so there are lots of space. Very poor quality. Very disappointed since their Note 4 screen protector was well cut."
1,"This battery is excellent. It works perfectly like the original battery, more than 8 hours without charger and full use.<br />I recommend it, Great purchase!<br /><br />Sorry for my poor english. Im from Venezuela!<br /><br />Grettings for all!"
1,works great
1,"When I bought the phone, I loved the leather curve to it. But qucikly found I needed a case for it.  But this particular model with the curve is almost impossible to find a case that works and looks good without being bulky and difficult.  This works perfect and is very slim looking"
1,"Excellent product the sound is great! I specially like the bass definition, by the other hand I ware it to run out and gym and it´s quite confortable with good fit, I definitelly recommend it."
0,This phone carrier ended up being to bulky and the stand wasn't that convenient
0,"Price good, like the clip.  But won't accommodate plugs with larger plastic base."
1,Best screen protector I have ever bought.
1,"Love it, it just needs a place for  a stylus."
1,"Purchased for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it arrived yesterday.  It charges quickly has a very clear display. Nice design but you need to push the spring loaded adjuster (right side of battery) mechanism all the way out and it creates a ton of resistance on the springs. The plastic cover feels like it's going to snap off. If they would have designed it 2 mm wider this wouldn't be a concern.  If you don't have a wide battery, I would give this serious consideration. Pic posted for S4 owners with OEM battery.   I'll post back after a few months or when it breaks :-)"
1,"This portable charger is very good. It charges up my iPhone 6 to full really fast and keeps it running on my long journey from work each day. Otherwise the journey on public transportation would be hell without my phone and this Superpak keeps the power flowing.  The quality of the product is nice and durable. I've dropped it a couple times and noting broke; it keeps on working. The white color is fantastic with my iPhone and other accessories.  The small size and awesome  charging capability is why I really like this device. It doesn't take up much room in my purse and how light it is, I don't even notice it there.  I received this product from UNU's review program in exchange for my honest review."
-1,What a terribly messy product with excessively complicated application. Buy the new &#34;glass&#34; screen protector instead. This is not a good alternative.
-1,Breaks easily. Rubber cover gets dirty fast & don't protect phone really well. Screen protector that comes with it is okay.
1,"I purchased this for my 13 year old grandson and this is his review:<br />Hey guys. I have had this charging case for about two months now it's been great. I love the colorway it comes in(white/gold or black/silver). Also, so far it has been a very durable case. I have dropped it accidentally a few time and there has not been one scratch on the phone. Also if your phone is dead you can charge it back about 70-80% up. But the reason I wouldn't totally five stars this is because the case battery takes up an extremely long time to charge completely. I'd say your phone will last a whole day. Thx"
1,Perfect Fit!!!
-1,It did not fit as advertised. If you have a note 3 from verizon it will not work.
0,"The case fits perfecly. However, the case is not grip when we hold."
1,If charges my phone. Boobies.
1,Very nice upper mount for my tripod. Expanding clasp holds my iPhone 6 tightly. I highly recommend this.
-1,Worked once. Was hoping I could rate it with no stars.
1,Seems ok so far after 1 month of usage. I did have other 3rd party replacement batteries that went flat very quickly after 2 weeks of usage. This is a quality product that I will not hesitate to recommend.
1,"The clear Ringke Fusion case is stylish and functional. Raised edges keep the back and front of the phone from coming into contact with flat surfaces, and buttons remain easy to press. I especially enjoy the headphone port cover, as it gives the case a more finished feel. One minor compliant is that the TPU sides of my case have started to yellow, most likely due to UV exposure. Additionally, the thin strip of TPU above the micro-usb port cover is fragile, though it has not broken on my specific case.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good value case, this is the one!"
1,Perfect! Keeps my phone safe and i bedazzled it to give it a bit more pizazz
1,"Great case, I love the strap and the magnetic closing, it is very secure. Inside there is room for 3 credit cards and money etc."
1,Fdo
-1,its ok
-1,Don't waste your money. Design peels off the first day of owning it.
1,I bought this for a friend so I'm not using it myself and can't really review it.
-1,"I have had this pone for about two to three months now and I am very disappointed. The camera quality is terrible. The battery life is even worse. I find myself having to charge my phone a few times a day. Also, when I am texting the phone will close me out of my app for no reason. It'll close me out of my internet as well. All in all I'd give this phone a 0 out of 10. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Pricey but worked fine on recent trip to China.
1,Very cute colors and perfect fit!!
-1,"So it does only give you privacy but with a high cost!!!<br />1) A privacy screen should stop people from seeing the screen, not me! I had to have full brightness on to see anything on my iPhone. this drains my battery much faster.<br />2) the screen protector pushes buttons on the screen.<br />3) it peels off quickly.<br /><br />Returning this right now!"
1,I love this cable cord.  It works perfectly.  I use to charge my Samsung tablet and phone.  It gives me plenty of length to be able to charge and use my tablet and not be next to a wall.
1,"I used a few sticks before but there were always technical problems after a short time of using. I was sceptical during ordering this one but after one week of intensive using I am really satisfied. Good material, great connectivity with my iPhone 5s and those amazing tips in eBook? If you are planning to get a selfie stick I really recommend this one."
1,Gift
1,"So far good, still trying to get used to the set up. Does work better than my old unit"
1,Just as described
0,its okay
1,"Sturdy, super cute"
0,I had a hard tiem to attached the screen protector withour bubbles. I finally used water/soap spray and it worked but not after waisting 4 of those screen savers trying to apply them without liquid.
1,Works well
1,good cover
1,Nice
1,awesome product. fits my phone perfectly. thank you for a speedy delivery
1,Super smart watch. I love the notifications without having to check my phone. Great for meetings or when I'm on a job site.
0,"Picture quality is great and it has the largest screen I have ever seen on a portable player. HOWEVER, it is not the most solid construction. The door to the DVD holder busted after about 8 uses. It has a MUCH harder time reading a scratched disc than our regular dvd players. I would have loved this player if it was more durable, as the concept and image is awesome. Just need a higher quality construction. Now I cat return it, and I am out the $."
1,its so useful
1,"I have been using this in my car, at work and at a home.  It works just like the official Apple charger."
1,Was exactly what I ordered. I am quite happy with my cover.
1,Working like it should.
1,I love enjoying using solar power electronics. I never thing about to get portable charger.
1,Absolutely LOVE it
1,Much better than Mpow Streambot Oval FM Transmitter Wireless which I brought earlier....!!
1,It's simple enough and works .
1,"Amazing came earlier than expected, it was exactly as explained"
1,Great quality case for a great price. For a case like this at a mall you would pay SO much more.
-1,Not worth the money. Buy otterbox!
1,easy to snap right on to the flip phone and stays on fits perfectly
-1,"Decent case at first. Relatively thin for a case with a stand, good shock protection.<br />Case stand broke within a few months of buying it just from normal usage, sorta just have it taped down so the stand doesn't just flop out constantly now.<br />Rather flimsy stand to begin with."
-1,"DO NOT BUY THIS CASE. I bought it early June because I was going to the beach for a week with some friends and needed to keep my phone charged. It worked great over the summer and my phone was always charged. However, last month the charger for the case got annoying and I had to situate my phone a certain way to charge it - got annoying. And last week, my phone started to randomly power off then signal that I needed to charge my phone, so I would turn on my charging case, and my phone would turn back on but be at 50% or higher (it never really needed the charging but it just said I did). And last night, my phone completely turned off and did not turn back on. The only screens I could see where the charging signal when I plugged it in, the apple logo would flash, and then a black screen. Today, I went to Verizon after numerous phone calls with Apple and Verizon, and after putting my iPhone in recovery mode on iTunes. Verizon told me my battery had probably died, so I went to a local computer store to ask for more help and they told me that my battery and circuit board were FRIED. Why? Because of this case. Non-apple chargers will DESTROY your phone. My phone did not like that charger, and so after these months it ruined my phone. My 5S (that I've only had for a year) is trash now - all because of this case. I suggest not buying this case or ANY off brand chargers because your iPhone will NOT like it. If you do buy this case, only charge when needed. Not everyday. I had to end up buying a iPhone 6 (taking my dad's upgrade) and it was NOT worth it. I am warning you - DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
0,"Deceiving description! Have to return. Didn't read further into the description that this is for the 6 Plus. Doh! It looks as pictured, but can not review based on functionality or durability. I suggest the item be renamed to say iPhone 6 Plus in the first mention of it in the description."
1,Shipped fast. Description was accurate. I'm happy with purchase.
1,great~~
1,Perfect condition works great
1,"Everything you want in an iPhone charger!<br />1. Fast Charging<br />2. Unbreakable<br />3. Long<br />and looks nice especially if your iPhone is gold (Y)<br /><br />I bought two other chargers, and this was the best one for the price."
1,Excellent buy for the price . it's a great product
0,Only down side  is the cleaner that they send with it doesnt quite do as good of a job as you would like so you still may end up with particles under the shield
1,This does fit my JAX S1360 just fine. It is a pretty rich purple color not pink at all. The makers don't say it fits the JAX but it really does just fine. I snipped 1/8 of an inch off at the bottom front (notched cutout edge) so it would not overlap the bottom keys. Otherwise it works well and makes the phone much less slippery and much easier to handle. This phone is the one that Assurance Wireless customers get through state Lifeline plans.
-1,The worst Bluetooth ever. Wouldn't charge fully. Battery sucks. Noisy.
0,The case was great but it's the holster that comes with it  is too tight. You can't take out or put the phone in the holster with one hand.
-1,It stop working after one  (1)
1,So far great. We have old worn out car jacks. The average converter doesn't make contact well so tried this one it looked larger. It feels larger and better made. I've tried it in two of the worn jacks and it really works great. Constant contact better charge.
-1,"This case isn't worth the aggravation. It doesn't fit properly and constantly (and when I say constantly, I mean CONSTANTLY) pops off, making it absolutely worthless. Whatever money you intend to spend on this case, just take it and use it as kindling to start a fire or simply throw it in the trash. You'll get more use out of your cash that way. This was purchased for a &#34;DROID TURBO 32GB in Metallic Black&#34; and not the ballistic version.<br /><br />We purchased Aero Armor for some other phones and were so satisfied that we thought these would be of the same quality... they aren't!"
1,As described
1,Worked like a charm
1,"This thing kicks butt. Major upgrade for my phone. I didn't use the included screen protector. I bought a 3-pack of JETech plastic screen protectors and they work flawlessly with this case.  Even though it doesn't have a kickstand (my only complaint with the design), this case fixes several issues with my S6. First, it provides a non-slippery surface for what is an ultra slick glass-backed phone that slides off of pretty much anything I leave it on. So now my phone doesn't careen off the center console of my truck like an air hockey puck while I gently glide up the driveway. The buttons and both parts of the case feel very solid, and neither flimsy nor manufactured with excessive tolerances. The case clipped together perfectly flush over my phone, and it looks really great and makes the phone just a tad beefier, which is nice because it makes it easier to keep a grip on the thing. I'm confident if I dropped it getting out of the car or while walking down the street, my phone would be safe even if the case were scratched/dinged or popped apart on impact.  Second, it provides amazing versatility as an extended battery. This was my biggest gripe with the S6 - subpar battery life with no way to buy an additional battery to swap in as necessary, or (my typical choice) a bigger extended battery to keep the phone going strong for up to a couple of days of regular, non-heavy usage. This rechargeable case elegantly solves the problem and does so flawlessly. The button is flush with the case and cannot be easily depressed on accident. You press and hold it for a couple seconds, and the case displays how much juice is left in it and immediately charges the phone. I was satisfied with the speed with which this is accomplished - I went from 65% to 100% in 40 minutes. This is precisely in line with the advertised 0%-100% full charge time of 2 hours.  Finally, the forward-facing stereo speakers are extremely loud and sound great, very clear. Definitely an upgrade from the bottom-mounted mono speaker the phone was designed with. Listening to tunes or playing games on the S6 without a Bluetooth speaker or headphones has never sounded so punchy and detailed. You can actually hear the stereo separation, and each track in the mix comes through pretty cleanly. I was impressed with the clarity and volume of the speakers.  One more downside to this case is that standard 1/8&#34; stereo plugs can't reach the headphone jack on the S6 when inside the case because the case is so thick, it prevents the plug from reaching the jack. Luckily, Alpatronix ships a small 1/8&#34; stereo extender with this rechargeable case, and I just leave it attached to the end of the aux cable in my truck. I guess if I used headphones a lot, it might be annoying to have to bring this little adapter with me everywhere I went in case I wanted to listen to some tunes, but since I only listen to music off my phone when driving, it is a negligible issue and was solved by the manufacturer rather reasonably.  Overall, I'm stoked. This was precisely what I needed."
1,"I originally purchased a black one for my Samsung Galaxy Note Edge based on my experience with the one I had for my prior cell phone. I loved it some much, I purchased a brown one. My requirements were that it had to be slim, protect the phone from scratches, easy to access, attractive and offer a way to carry it in & around the straps of various size pocketbooks. The pouch has 2 different loops for attaching it to a belt, purse or around the neck and came with a ring and a long string. Unfortunately, neither of these items work very well, at least for me. So I bought a foot of  small link chain from Home Depot , strung it through the inside loop opening and closed the ends with a ring used to hold keys. Now I can slide one end of the chain off and attach the pouch around the straps of different purses. With the small loop on the back, I attached a  3&#34; belt ring to hang it around larger straps or briefcases.  If, in the future I want to carry the phone on my body, I would buy a longer length of chain along with jewelry clasps and hang it across my body or on my shoulder. And finally, it fits nice and slim inside a larger purse just buy itself."
0,It doesn't charge my phone all the way and it over heats and the case dies fast and its flimsy
1,"Good unit at a good price. Multi layering of the rubber clamp inserts makes it adaptable almost ant handlebar diameter. Holds your phone rock solid and the rubber security net is a great addition. Put this on my Harley and have used it several times with no issues whatsoever. Only complaint is that the pinch bolt is WAY too long. I suppose it may be necessary for a wider diameter handlebar but for my application I could use one about 1/2 as long. For the price, an excellent buy."
1,I love the color! Very light and sleek. Not bulky like a lot of cases.
1,"The colors are great and they fit the Samsung Galaxy S5 pretty well, although I wish they fit a little more snuggly so they didn't come off so easily. The piece above where the phone gets plugged in is a little loose."
1,Fits great! Arrived on time. Thank you!
1,Good item
1,Great
1,good cable.
0,"It held my phone pretty well, but it's entirely made of plastic. Mine broke off when I slid out on my moped, for the price I won't be buying another one."
1,works
1,It was steal and more sturdy than I thought too bad I got turquoise instead of black
1,"It's good and look nice. It fits well too, but cards slots are already cracked or ripped off and in fact that not much card on it."
1,A+
1,Works and looks great.
1,"We have a bazillion cords all over out countertop and this has wrangled them somewhat....we still have all the cords, but now I no longer have to switch them out after charging bc they can all plug into this on base. I've had NO problems of overheating like some people mentioned, and I keep this plugged in ALL the time."
-1,Clip fell off the device the second day and was lost. So disappointed to have wasted money for one day.
1,Works great!
1,very strong and robust car charger. great product
1,"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
1,I really liked this phone case until the lining for the cardholder started to fall apart
1,They fit!!!!
1,"Perfect kit. It has everything you need to repair your iPhone. You have to put in the labor, but it is well worth it for the price and knowing the repair job is performed by you!"
1,Very good.
1,"Durable. Have not had any issues. Dropped my phone in this case and no cracks, breaks or anything. Would recommend it. Like the sleek professional look of it as well."
1,Great product! Just as described.
0,Box dimensions fit my application perfectly (5 stars) but the cutout was off center (minus 1 star). Also had a two screws that won't tighten (minus 1 star) wood stripped with minimal torque.
-1,"The space for cards is not big enough, resulting in broken after two months."
1,A great phone holder
1,"I'm not sure if they are discontinuing these ear buds, but they're the best by far! They are comfortable, and provide good bass. I've had about 6 sets of these because I always ruin them but it's my fault. I've put them through the washer several times and they still worked. I've had beats ear buds but they come nowhere close to the 50/50's."
1,It good
1,"Great price, quality product, and arrived way ahead of expected delivery date. Yay, Empire!"
1,Best case on the market. Fits perfect:)
0,hold the phone just fine but don't really like to use both hands to stretch open to insert the phone into it. Too much force.
1,It works great!
-1,Not as expected
-1,Cheap quality! Started leaking on second day of usage!
1,"Very nice straightforward chargerss. I wanted something small and handy to use for plugging in my extra electronics for charging. I keep running out of wall outlets for usb plugs.This 2 pack Wall Charger set was perfect so I can carry both with me when traveling as well. I am always looking for an extra plug to charge my phone. They work for mobile phones, tablets, and the other smaller devices. They look really sleek and shiny and the plastic is by no means thin and it can handle a little tossing around just fine. I can charge my Samsung Galaxy S6 and my external battery pack without any issues at all. These wall chargers are way better than the original wall chargers that came with the products, and they charge both products faster than the original plugs. I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest."
-1,Piece of crap. Didn't even fit my phone and the back fell out of it. Guess that's what you get for only spending 5 bucks
1,"I bought this for my wife she love it,  its really beautiful and the rocks are good quality"
1,"great case, quality price and very durable"
1,Exactly like it was said
1,Was delivered early and tastes great! Works well for me since I have stopped smoking cigarettes!
1,"Love it! Came quickly, fits my Note 4 perfectly and looks great!"
1,"Works great, protects well. Great design to help keep hold of it. Only downside is the top and bottom are loose but not a major issue. Easy to remove and clean."
0,"The description is misleading, because I believed I was receiving a white case, but received a black one. Other wise a fine product."
-1,First week into owning this junk and the holster dropped it a dozen times and broke the screen on my brand new phone. Took it off and trashed it. The design of the holster is poorly engineered and relies solely on the retention of the plastic nubs to hold it in place. One little jolt and it tumbles out right onto the ground. Steps down from equipment ladders are what matched the wits of the designers of this product.
1,Its a cord. Works or doesn't. This one did.
1,"Very thin case. It can fit in my armband case with this case on. Gold color matches the phone color almost exactly. Most people think I don't have a case on. Thankfully haven't dropped my phone yet to see how the case would help. A very small corner piece on the bottom left did chip off somehow, but no biggie. Purchased the end of May 2015."
1,My little sister loves it!!!
-1,Bad quality.  Fell apart.
1,Works as needed
0,I like the idea of having a backup camera on E 250 cargo van.  Gives you a sense of security of not hitting the subject behind.  The wide angle is nice  and installation was just about one hour due to removal of panels. Display could be better quality and once hot it flickers. It is very light sensitive and the license plate light blurs the screen.
1,"Not quite right die cut, but close enough.  Price is right."
1,The six foot Anker cable is well made and should give years of service. Great price for it and the packaging for it is good considering it's just a cable.
-1,This is a very sturdy looking retractable charging cord. It retracts really well and the flat design keeps it from tangling. I bought it based on all the wonderful testimonial reviews. Especially from owners of iPhones. Imagine my disappointment when I first plugged it into my iPhone 6 and I received an error message saying it's not compatible with my phone.
1,"I just received the black and gold case and I already LOVE IT!!!!!!! Looks really elegant with my iphone having a black face. It was very easy to put on, lightweight, and I also ordered a screen protector from Amazon to protect the top of my phone. This case feels so comfortable to handle and I love the idea of the cutouts not to interfere with the charger, etc. I've owned two LifeProof cases. They are extremely durable, nice and light to handle but ended up throwing them in the garbage. I had problems with the Life Proof case after owning it for around 6 months with volume being turned down, phone being on when I shut it off and draining my battery so many times. I cannot comment on how long the finish will last on this case but hope it holds up well. This case is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!"
1,Works great
1,Just what I needed
-1,the material is very cheap
1,Extremely nice case! The build quality is excellent and the feel is superb. Truly a nice case.
1,Thanks...
1,Love it good quality
-1,"Very durable, affordable case. My only issue is the plastic is very slippery to grip."
1,"Fits perfectly and is exactly like the original. You will need a very small screwdriver to install, like the kind used for eye glasses repair."
1,Replacement battery for a 2.5 year old Samsung Galaxy S3. Works very well and keeps the phone charged for more than a day with minimal use.
1,Came faster than I expected for a shipment from across country And it works great in the sun!
-1,This isn't what I got in the mail! I specifically ordered the one without the window on the front. The one I got was very similar but has a plastic window on the front of the book case.<br />Also the one I received in the mail didn't have the small flap that comes over the side to hold closed.<br />The picture isn't right either. The color of the case is washed out blue! The one in the picture is very blue and the one I got is almost not even blue. The harder part of the case that is that baby blue that holds the phone it's self is blue in the picture. The one I got was black.<br />It wasn't what I ordered. I don't want to hassle with sending it back. I'm just going to give it away.
-1,"Actual phone cover is strong and fully protects.  Unfortunately, the holster broke immediately upon first try at using stand function.  Glued the stand on permanently so lost that function.  Then, 3 days later the clip broke.  Right at the hinge where a flimsy design (just like half a dozen I've wasted money on) results in conplete failure of last feature; the belt clip. . Don't waste your money.  I'd give it lower rating but the actual case is pretty sturdy, especially if you used lots of Super Glue to hold the stand undeployed, which is a drag."
1,This has worked very well for my new iPhone 6 Plus and everything else I need to carry.  I just hope I don't get up and walk away without taking it along with me because it is definitely new for me not to wear my wallet and phone.
1,Great
1,Excellent earphones + data cable.  I wasn't sure if these wouldn't cause the dreaded &#34;voice control&#34; error with my iphone that non-oem earphones tend to do.  They haven't and work like a charm.  Another pair that I bought at the same time that was a bit cheaper and seemed just as reliable weren't and occasionally cause that annoying problem.  The cable seems reliable as well.
1,very long lasting charge...thumbs up
1,The only thing I was a little disappointed in was that it wasn't as bright as I thought it would be like in the picture.
1,great product
1,Really Nice
-1,Soft case no protection here and a sloppy fit around the edges And whatever you do  DONT GET THE WHITE.After an hour in my soft case I wear on my belt it came out stained with black scuff marks.and they don't come clean up.
-1,Not the greatest sound.
1,Great my son loves his new case
1,"One of the corners doesn't completely close, other than that, it does what a shell should do."
1,Perfect fit for the S4!
1,Purchased as a gift for my husband and he loves it! Was describes very well and even came earlier than expected!! Would definitely but from you guys again
1,I love it !!
1,This is a very light weight retractable Micro charger cord. I love the retractable cord I tem because we usually have cords going EVERYWHERE in our van. This makes it a lot easier to keep cords from tangling. Cable length is approximately 90 cm or 2.9 ft. I really like it has a usb port because that means I can charge my phone and so can my husband without fighting over who's phone will charge first.<br /><br /> I received this product at a discount price in exchanged for my honest and unbiased review.
1,"Fit the phone well, easy to apply, seems to provide good protection."
-1,"It's cheap, and it works to play my songs from my ipod in my car, but not for long."
-1,"When I first got this in the mail I was very happy with it. I order 4 more. But after using each one for a couple of months I found the became loose and difficult to use. One by one I had to give up on each one. I had to by a moe expensive charger, but it is still working..."
0,"I can envision occasions in which this case could be preferable to a regular &#34;shell&#34; type case. For instance, we travel a great deal (both for work and pleasure), it would be fantastic to have this case for the airport since you can tuck a credit card and an ID into the little pocket. Likewise, I can see it being that perfect party-night phone-case. When we go to Vegas, I always have a little wristlet in which to carry my phone, a few bills, and a credit card. So, here, this case would make that a bit easier and more compact.  As for everyday occasions, I find this folio style to be cumbersome and frustrating. The top flap is more burdensome than I imagined (and is so much less convenient than I imagined). For me, this will not be my everyday case (but will keep it for special occasions).  As always with OtterBox, the quality is outstanding and the look is quite nice. The black case is slightly nicer in-person, but this is still very nice. (The brown here has a bit too much red in it ... if it were darker, it might translate as a bit more professional).  Finally, this frustration-free packaging is a great alternative to the plastic clam-shells that these are usually shipped in (here, you can just recycle the cardboard. Nice!)  So, it all depends on what you need and what you find most comfortable. What doesn't work for me, might be your ideal!"
1,"Excellent quality, feels a little awkward to wear but not uncomfortable, mute works well, have not used with Skype, noise cancelation is great."
1,Excellent portable charger don't have 2 go inside and charge it
1,Excellent case same as the picture 😌
-1,"Wish I could give it zero stars, as the product fit too loose on my Galaxy S6 Edge and wouldn't charge. The second time I tried to connect it, it just plain didn't work anymore. I'm returning this asap."
-1,It's not how it's presented and the charger doesn't work at all. It's a waste of money.
1,Does it's job perfectly on my iPad
1,Arrived with 2-day free shipping as promised.  Inserted my Cricket SIM and I was up and running in 5 minutes.  Nice size sharp 7&#34; clear screen.  Movies and videos are crisp.  Great value.  BLU products are changing the marketplace with quality low-cost competitive products.  I am normally a Samsung customer but BLU is starting to change that.
1,Quick and easy to install!
1,"I was looking for something that I could easily carry that would give me definitive control and allow for using my finger print capability of my iPad Air 2.  I had read some reviews on other products similar to this and found that it was not unusual for the rotating fame to  chafe the back of the iPad leaving a ring on the back of the iPad but this product provided sufficient clearance while allowing for 360 degrees of rotation.  the only thing that was not perfect to me is the strap on the back where you put your hand.  It i velcro but does not provide for an aesthetic presentation.  It has a retractable stand on the back that is quite nice allowing for set up of the iPad when I set it down and want to monitor the iPad, this functions perfectly.  Although I would redesign the hand strap,I would buy this again."
-1,Not what i wanted
1,Works great in both our cars. Adjustable for different vents. I can see the screen when using my GPS and its hands free.
1,"Fast charging on two ports, normal for others. Other than that, great product, use it for travel too."
1,My daughter loves it i would buy more if i had to
1,I like the mesh tipped stylus.  They are much more sensitive than the rubber tipped ones.
1,Selfie stick is an AWESOME product. Highly recommended
1,Good
-1,Sound quality is horrible
-1,"Good cable that seems very robust, it's pretty thick but the head that plugs into the phone isn't any larger that the OEM cable so it still fits phones that have cases.  Edit 9/7/15: I seem to have reviewed a little early. Today I noticed that the head of the cable is separating from the cable and exposing the wire underneath. I contacted Amazon support and over the course of 23 minutes (on chat) got the same as others: the cable is more than 30 days old and can't be returned, after explaining (3 times) that I wasn't trying to return and that I wanted it exchanged I was told that they would create an &#34;exception&#34; to allow me to return it. I then told the chat rep that I would pick it up later with phone support. I offered the option of upgrading me to the &#34;fixed&#34; version of this cable and I would pay the difference, but was rejected.  I'm not sure if even updating this review is worth it as it looks like this product is no longer available, but I'll update it just in case it does become available again.  Amazon, get your issues sorted out on Amazon Basic warranties. You are the &#34;manufacturer&#34; and dealer for this product, you should be able to get this figured out. You as a company also need to get your reps on one page with regards to this issue."
-1,Extremely cheap. Doesnt stay on the phone. Design is great though.
1,"Outstanding product! As with any screen protector that has adhesive to adhere to the screen, placing it on the screen can be a bit of a challenge. However if you do it properly the result is a great screen protector...one of the best."
1,I just received this charger and it's great. It works very well. Happy with the service and product.
1,"Perfect case for my phone.  It protects while providing a slim, classy cover."
1,Saved my phone!
-1,Slips out of my hand way more than any case I have ever had. This is the first time i have shattered a phone screen.<br />Battery works when needed which is the only reason that I gave it any stars. Its starting to not always respond when i press the button. not sure if this is due to dropping it too many times.<br />I wish the back coating wasnt so slick and had a little more texture to grip to. I will probably be getting a Mophie instead
1,"Hello out there! This review is credulous and fortunate for me; this item took 35 min to charge, 15 sec to pair one phone and turn it off,<br />15 sec to pair second phone and turn it off, turn the main phone (default phone) on first pair in 8 sec, turn second phone on and it pair in<br />10 sec. It plays music right away or you push on/off to stop. If you want the music to continue just do nothing until a call comes in. Also I left my phone on the table and walk outdoor about 25 yards away &#34;the music continue and another time I received a call while out at the mail box &#34;it was clear and the caller could hear clearly too. YES I SAY TO YOU BUY IT"
1,Excellent case.  Very sturdy but light weight
1,Excellent protection for my Droid Maxx. Slips in and out of my pocket easily.
-1,Dropped it once and it broke
1,"I went to the Bahamas for vacation and participated in Pat & Tina's Snorkel Adventure in Freeport, Bahamas. I read about the FRIEQ Waterproof case prior to ordering based on customer reviews. I was ecstatic about this item since I'm a photographer in my own right take many pictures and selfies within a days time. I. really wanted to capture the essence of photos on and under water without damage to my smartphone. Well I must say I highly recommend this product it is all that and then some. Very easy storage and use of the smart phone while in the case. I snorkeled with the case around my neck connected to the lanyard and all I had to do was click away. My photos on my Samsung Galaxy were clear as a bell. The video recording was authentic underwater when recording. The only thing I had a problem with while underwater...when I pressed the button to record, it didn't recognize the command underwater, so I just pushed the button above water and recording was in process while I proceeded to go under."
0,"My husband likes the fact that his phone is protected, but doesn't care for the fact that it makes the phone so big and cumbersome....wish he would keep it on though!!!"
1,best case i ever owned
-1,"It's too big for my ear, and there's no way to adjust it! Very disappointed."
1,I dropped my phone a few times with this on and it really saved it from cracking. The only problem is that its hard to press the volume keys with iyt on
1,Used it for my studio LTE 5.0 had to make modifications on buttons and charge port.cut new opening for charge port and widened volume button hole on the hard case.works great now
1,"Bought the Geekout 1000 a couple of weeks back. Boy was I blown away. it may seem deceptively small but the sound it produces will blow your mind. the moment the geekout is plugged in, it makes the entire song come alive and one can be lost in the subtle nuances of the music forever. best DAC I ever had."
-1,Tried to disinfect my phone once with a rubbing alcohol wipe. Basic Isopropyl alcohol. It DESTROYED the protector with scratches and swirl marks. How am I supposed to clean my phone after lab??
0,I love the case but at the first day the metallic part got scratch is not a lot but i thought it wouldnt scratch
1,"This far exceeded my expectations of the quality for the price!  And the seller shipped extremely quick.  It has a built-in screen protector that I worried wouldn't be as responsive as a sticky film protector, but it has been great.  My eight year old has been the one using this, and no complaints from her either.  The stand stays out of the way pretty well, but is also removable (and can be used on either side) and since it wasn't a feature she was using, we just took it off completely.  The silicone is thick and durable with extra padding on the corners - I think it should protect it from most drops.  The color is a true red and very attractive."
1,Just what I needed. Great value.
1,Great product to organize all of my cords.
1,The same as the $40 one in stores just nicer on the wallet. I'm really rough on phones so I keep one in reserve so when I break it I can switch it out. So far they've lasted longer than the ones I've payed full price for
1,I am in the process of ordering this device and I am saying to myself oh what would we do without our gadgets.
1,"Update to original review.  My concern was that without extension nibs the plugs would be hard to remove.  As it turns out, they are very easy to remove even with a thicker case.  No problems at all."
1,"When reading reviews on this band, one stuck out &#34;not a want, a NEED!&#34;  I decided to take a chance, and I won!! LOVE this band, ridiculous fit, form fit to the watch, and quality material. It looks and feels expensive, a perfect partner to the watch. If you are even kind of thinking about buying this, GET IT.<br />Only thing, the pin remover that comes with it for removing band pieces is a little cheap. I bent the pin once or twice while trying to remove a link. No biggie, used a screw driver and pliers to straighten it out."
0,I Like it. Its usefull. But dont give every bit of power ! sad.
1,Phone stills works after 2 years.
-1,Stopped working after about 2 weeks.
-1,"I purchased 100 of these mounts to hold 7&#34; tablets for our company vehicles.  We were using the tablets mainly for a push-to-talk app in places of 2-way radios, so there was some pressure on the tablets from pushing the screen.  In less than the course of 1 year, 90% of the top and/or bottom bracket pieces broke in half at the bend.  Most tablets were mounted vertically, so the brackets were stretched out to the max.  If you were to place a tablet/phone horizontally, there would be less pressure on the tabs and they might hold up better.  However, we did not and almost all the bracket tabs broke.<br />I will say that this bracket is very adjustable and was easy to screw into the dashboard area of our vehicles.  The base is small enough to fit on lots of areas of the dashboard but it still wide enough to be very stable and secure."
-1,did not last 6 months
1,I mean it's great but I thought it would cover top and bottom more but I really enjoy it
-1,"The screen protector have a grid of dots, as per the seller it's meant to improve the response to touching of the screen, but for me this is bad and I didn't get to use it at all because I just hate having to see those dots on my high quality screen colours. I wish I knew about this before buying it!"
1,"Fits snug, looks good. I would suggest getting the black case with the black edition and the silver case with the white edition, but that's just preference in my opinion.<br />Pros: easy to install, stylish, protection from light drops, and not easily damaged. Also allows clearance for camera and front screen when set on table<br />Cons: none that I have experienced yet"
1,The old battery would not hold a charge but this new one has worked great .
1,Great!
1,"Have older car so this is perfect,"
1,Item as specified.
1,Good produt
1,"works well, great price"
1,It was exactly what I wanted!
1,"Can't have too many charging cables these days.  My iPhone is my life.  I charge it at home, in the car, and at work.  It's also charged when we travel.<br /><br />Yes, I could take the same charging cable with me everywhere I go, but why?  At this price point it's work keeping one where you need it so it's always there.<br /><br />I've had no problems with these since purchasing them and am very happy with the quality."
-1,The phone glitches when it is plugged and you are using it. Not good.
1,"I'm pretty new to Anker products but so far every time I have purchased from Anker I've been very satisfied. This is the best car charger I've owned. I've used up to 3 ports at a time and it works well all the time. I'd recommend this to anyone. If you're not sure, I say just go for it. You'll be satisfied! Even if you aren't... Anker customer service is the absolute best."
1,love it
1,Great case. easy to pop on but stays put. Love the red and black. Received it fast.
1,Very nice. Hooked this up to dual voice cool infinity subwoofer 2 ohms and bridged it to one ohm. You can hook this to your stock speakers for signal. For the price you can't beat it! Use this on stock stereo for some extra thump. Not recommended for someone trying to beat the did off or competition but my infinity has plenty of power shakes mirrors and everything but doesn't dim the lights
0,"I am a die-hard &#34;review reader.&#34;  This was highly recommended by so many iPhone users that I gave it a shot.  The only issue I have (and I won't take more stars away), is that the sticky part that holds the green tab that allows you to pull the plastic away, still stays sticky and you can see that spot when you mount the protective cover properly.  There is no way (that I'm aware of) to get that stickiness away, without ruining the entire cover.  I will not pull it off for fear I wouldn't get it back on properly.  Obvious, I'm the only one who has had this issue and I will wait until it's time to change it, then go with another brand."
1,Worked great and lots of compliments!
1,I have two of these in a 94 camaro on 30 00 watts @ 2ohms an it's so loud I can be herd 3 blocks away I love them an I'm about to buy 2 more to add to it awesome sound an really durable I have them way overpowered an still they hold up great sub!!!!
-1,"It worked for a little while (a few months), but then I'd have to hold the cord in place for it to start charging. Sometimes when it would start charging, the phone would pop up a message that said it wasn't supported by Apple and wouldn't work at all."
0,It's okay. Too big with all my cards in it so I am not using it any more.
1,Great find.  Very happy with this purchase.  Very useful for travel.
1,"Works well ,not too bulky"
1,"Omg I love this case . Seriously the absolute best best best best case ever. The only thing I could say is that I wish they had some that had designs or sayings or something, otherwise this is the best case I've ever bought. I don't have to carry my phone and a wallet."
1,I had this same case in gray...bought a bigger phone and had to buy this case. I love that it holds my credit card and ID so that I don't have to carry my purse everywhere. It's not bulky and I don't have to open a flap or anything. I love it!
1,"This stand came in a sturdy white box, absolutely suitable for wrapping and gift giving. Upon removing from the box, I was pleasantly surprised that it felt so sturdy and well made. There is a slot in the back to run your iPhone charging cable through, as well as a spot to &#34;dock&#34; your apple watch. It looks bigger in the picture, and I was relieved that it was much smaller upon opening the package. There are rubber feet on the bottom, and I was happy to see that it doesn't move easily across my desk. The design is awesome, and I love it. I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review."
1,"Great fit and easy to put on. No bubbles. Depending on your case, it corners may push up a bit."
1,"I purchased an Anker battery to resolve my charging problem, but it did not.  After their customer service department sent me a new one for free it became clear it was an issue with my phone, not their battery. Anker was incredibly responsive to my initial complaint, even inquiring whether it had resolved my problem after they had sent me a replacement one.  Very impressed with their customer service, it is among the best..."
1,I upgraded from the Lumia 521.<br />I like everything about the Lumia 640 XL especially the big bright screen. I am using it with GoSmart Mobile with no problems.
1,"My cell phone is my only source of communication, it's great to know I have a back up.  I wasn't sure which size to get, glad I decided on the 20w"
1,Fdo
1,Good phone
1,It does chip and crack the edges pretty easily but my phone has fallen flat on its face many times and the protector hasnt fully cracked. This is my second one because the first one died protecting my phone's screen during a nasty fall. This is smooth and i feel no difference between this and the actual phone glass.
1,Great quality
1,Great selfie stick to own. Easy to set up and use! Customer support fantastic. Every single query I made was addressed promptly. Love it!
1,"Very good and comfortable headphone. Sound quality to me sounds better than the Beats these replaced. Very good price, they don't feel cheap."
1,Works and looks great!
1,Nice
1,Just as advertised
1,"Unit works fine but I thought it was the type that plugs directly into the wall instead of via a cable.  Nothing wrong functionally just not as compact when traveling. I kept the product because it does what it's intended, just wish I read more carefully before purchase."
0,"Seems to be good quality. Zipper is heavy duty so it won't fall apart easily. However, it's A LOT bigger than I was expecting and talking on my phone while it's in this case is a very difficult and awkward task. I like the case and love the idea of having all of my cards and phone in one spot together, but unfortunately I'll be returning it for a smaller one."
1,Fits perfect and super cute!
-1,It looks and fits great but it fell ones and it shattered a corner to pices
-1,Fell of 2 days after I put it on.
1,"Just got this for my new phone. I'm an absolute clutz as I usually try to carry or do far more than I have hands for. Didn't have this on my phone for but two days when the phone slipped out off my pocket as I was carrying groceries and landed on the sidewalk corner first. Cannot even see where it hit the concrete.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Slim case.<br />Great price<br /><br />Cons:<br />Have had it just a week or so, the color is already getting dingy. But for the price, it's doing its intended job quite well.<br /><br />So far so good."
1,Super Quick shipping.  Item works very well.
1,I love this case!  It fits perfectly and it looks great!
1,Great case!!
0,Great audio.  Lousy battery life.  The battery is lucky to last more than gan 30 minutes.
1,Excellent
1,"very sturdy, protects well"
-1,"It is beautiful but it snags.  If only it used unpronged crystals around.  So I used nail polish to coat it.  The plastic surrounding the phone to encase it snapped and broke after just 3 weeks of use.  This version also has no inner pocket for cash, just the credit card slots."
1,"It works better than the glass screen protector I had bought before this.  It is easy to place and is invisible to the eye once in,  plus they give you 3 screens. A great deal."
1,very good
-1,It worked great for 4 months but usb connector on unit broke.  When I asked to return.  No reply.
1,I was very impressed when I got this case. It is made really well and fit my phone like a glove. It fits my buttons on my phone and I have no problem using them which I really like. The case itself protects my phone from being damaged. Nice pink and purple colors. This case is two parts and they are a harder plastic type material. I have to use a screen protector with this case to protect my screen and the case helps to protect my phone from being damaged.I would recommend this Iphone 5C case from MagicMobile. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.
1,"These guys work great! Beware of the GSM restrictions, though. It's in the manual, but no one reads it. Using certain channels and powers will get you in trouble with the FCC without a license! These are perfect and compact for our work events we had during August. Our buildings proved a little much with interference, but considering we weren't the Secret Service, they got the job done alright."
1,"Good connection with my nexus 4.  The USB charging port wore out, this is extending the life of my phone. Phone gets moderately war!m while charging, and I get full charge in 4-5 hours.  Orientation is easy, just center the phone and it works.  I sometimes place it in my car cupholder at an angle and put the phone on top, and it works well there too.  Significantly easier to align thanks qi alarm clock I used it with before.  Only problem is sometimes I knock it off the pad when sleep walking."
1,Very stylish. Waterproof. Everything works and is pretty comfortable. If you have a large wrist it may not be big enough. I'm 6'2&#34; 240 lbs. And i am on the second last hole on the band
1,installing this thing was easy first time i ever installed a car stereo...Bluetooth is awesome you don't have to reconnect every time you turn on the car it automatically connects to your phone so just hit the play button and it will start playing the music that you have on your phone....if you want to use the hands free calling you might wanna hook up the mic that comes with it otherwise the people on the other end of the call  will not hear you.....in my situation i wasn't able to speak through my phone while it was Bluetooth to the stereo...the touch screen is pretty responsive so that's good.......oh and i installed this in my 2006 Nissan Altima and did not need to buy a antenna  you can still use the factory antenna
0,We use it to charge my daughters Nexus 7 Gen 2.  It does charge but it is very slow.  The cord can be touchy at times as well.
-1,"Hate it, nothing but trouble.  Spent lots of time trying to fix problems, won't upload photos, message keeps going off, and there are no messages there."
1,Resistant
-1,Never worked. And feels cheap.
1,Excellent products. Super fast shopper. I will order again!
0,"It charges fine, but it slips out of the wall outlets too easily."
-1,Junk  Freezer bag
0,you get what you pay for it is a phone though and that's about all
0,Loved the look and I know I'm rough on cases but the rubber and the image started to peel pretty quickly :( expected more from otterbox
1,"This is an awesome deal! The quality is top notch. The color is vivid and bright. I was very impressed with the texture and toughness of braided sheath. This is definitely worth buying.  I am planing on ding it but this time in different colors than the orange and blue set, although I might just order another one of these as well. I love em soo much."
-1,"The product looked great and fit very well on the front. The back was slightly off and the letters didn't fit well with the camera so it looked a little poor. However, I gave it only 2 stars because it doesn't allow for the capacitive input from the top and bottom of the screen so I couldn't use the bottom swipe up which I use to get to the flashlight. Since this is one of the most common functions I use on the phone, I had to remove the front"
-1,This product was terrible. It didn't have the side mounts for the radio if I would of kept it my radio would of fallen out when I stopped. When I returned it they charged my $7 for shipping even though their product didn't include everything.
1,Simple plug in
-1,"Lost its &#34;color&#34; after one wear.. NOT GOOD, even for the price. Will not be buying anymore."
-1,"Plastic. Leaves much of the phone exposed. Did not work for me. The ad said rubberized material, I assumed something soft. It feels like hard plastic."
-1,After two days the belt loop attachment pulled away from the case making it uselesd
1,Love it! Will buy this product again!
1,works well
1,a
0,"A well made product, but it didn't allow the use of the iPhone case as i've become used to. the dimensions given didn't make it clear that the iPhone + a case wouldn't fit in the holster as I had experienced with one from years ago."
1,"I am always looking for a new case for my phone that will let it be more useful, enter the Card Slot Slim Armor case by Spigen. It features a solid case with the added benefit of having a slot for 2 credit cards. I used to use a Bulldog case and it added a little bulk but not much, this case by spigen ups the bulk a tiny bit but then again it function as a wallet as well and that is worth the bulk. The case has a rubber lib that covers the front of the screen to keep it raised so if you lay the phone face down (or drop it) the phone screen will be protected. The back is a hard plastic but has that removable slot for your cards to go into it. It only holds 2 cards, don't try to load more than that in it otherwise it will bulge and the slide/door could break. It works really well for what it is and I have no complaints over it other than this one, it makes the phone a tad slippery and because of that I am removing a star. Other than that this case really does a great job protecting the phone and adding more functionality at the same time.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above at a discount or for free in the hope that I would write a review about it.

1,This is a great product it's made from a  strong durable material  that really helps protect my phone!  I love the bright mint color it looks great on my white iPhone. The case also has a lip on the front that  helps might protect my phone while it was laying facedown .  This is an all-around great phone case I'm so glad I was given this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review !
1,My husband loves these.  Just wish the charge lasted longer.
-1,This is one of the most fragile phone cases I've come across in recent memory. There are 4 connector that connect the plastic gel case to the outer shell at all r corners and all but one of the connectors broke. The paint chips off very easily and now the case looks very warn even though it's only a few months old.<br /><br />There are some good things about the case though. Kick stand is convenient. There's also a nice padding on the back of the phone case that protects the s6 camera lense that sticks out more than most camera lenses. Would be a great phone case but I don't know how long it's going to last.
1,"Prone to dropping my phone so this works well for me, good shock proof. Its not screen protective since it is an open case (ie dont bang it on sharp corners) but for dropping it, the screen shouldn't crack.. ive had this for 5 months now and its still doing a great job! It doesnt really have any issues with not being able to fit a charger or headphones into it while its on so thats another plus."
1,"I ordered my watch band and was very pleased! Although, I did not read the reviews ahead of time and the screw for my adapter fell out. I was unable to find it. I work at the Apple Store in Raleigh and when your $500 watch falls on the floor in the middle of the store with 300 people it's hard to find a screw that small... It would be helpful if I could find the size for the screw so I could replace it. If anyone knows, it would be a great help."
1,"Works great, arrived quick."
1,"i had a problem in the past, destroying phones... With and without a case but now since I got an Otter box...I haven't had to replace my phone for almost 2 years"
1,"The screen was locked at first, but Samsung helped with a factory reset.  After that, the watch exceeded expectations.  A great entry into the smart watch market."
-1,It doesn't work in my car.  It was the dumbest purchase on Amazon
-1,It does protected but it doesn't look like is for the Note since it leaves a big gap after installing..
1,Love it!
-1,I brought this for my iPhone 6 plus because of the case not allowing my headphones to attach to the port. The connection is poor and goes in and out and does not allow the heads its total functionality such as answering the phone from the option on the headphones. It also does not function at all when I connect it to the radio converter in my car.
1,"I wanted to move a step up from the typical Skullcandy and Apple buds I'd been using. I've of loved what I,be had but was eager to see what the next tier up was like and I was soooo not disappointed...<br /><br />Look and Feel<br />The first thing you notice about the Symphonized NRG  2.0 earphones is how attractive they are. I got the dark brown finish with black and simply put they,re quite handsome and unique. The second thing I noticed was the quality of the cable. My previous experiences have been with very flexible, but somewhat flimsy cabling which has a propensity to turn into a rat's nest when stowed. These come out of the backpack pocket barely jumbled at worst. No frothy cable knots to gently subdue.<br /><br />Sound Quality<br />And then I put them on and played some music. While they are billed as noise-isolating, and I've never used noise-canceling so excuse my naïvet&eacute;, but I 'be apparently missed people speaking to me and as much as I hate being rude, these seem to really minimize ambient noise. The base range is much more pronounced and I've stopped equalizing to compensate for the earphone's profile. I will add that I have to listen with the volume ~30% lower with the NRG buds as they seem to produce a lot more sound for the same volume level, and they sound amazing.<br /><br />Telephony<br />I replaced a beloved pair of Skullcandy earbuds because I had conducted so many phone calls with them I literally frayed and unglued every rubber connection on them and they were quite threadbare in appearance. The same places I grab to insert/remove the buds is one solid piece of wood, which won't therefore fall apart from wear. And everyone had complimented how crystal clear I sounded in the old pair so I was concerned about microphone quality. I'm pleased to report that 100% of my audience indicated the quality had actually improved...hurray!<br /><br />Leakage<br />And, before donning them, I'm surprised they're even on because they don't leak, meaning adjacent cubicle workers aren't stuck listening to what I am. While the Skullcandy buds were discrete, I was always concerned They might be audible and therefore distracting to those nearby. Not a concern with the Symphonized NRG buds.<br /><br />Summary<br />I am not an audiophile and realize I don't know a great deal about &#34;high fidelity&#34; audio. I also acknowledge that I have probably damaged my ears with inferior products over the years (not the Apple or Skullcandy, but those horrible orange sponge Walkman headphones back in the eighties. That said I am very satisfied with this step up in design, look, feel, quality, and the discretion afforded by these and highly recommend them for individuals looking for the next level up. If this is a compromise, I'm in sound heaven!jacent cubicle workers aren't stuck listening to what I am.

0,"It fits good, durable, and cute-- but I ordered the purple and I received all black... It's cute anyways though."
1,Works perfectly!! It charged my phone from 1% to 93% in 40 minutes.
-1,The item is very bad quality..the glue is worst quality..i followed all the instructions and i was about to break my phone the next day because the glue went off. I don't recommend this item to anyone.. i consider my money was thrown in the air.
1,Worked like a champ!
1,Great
1,"I have used this numerous times and it works great, fits well and stays in place."
1,So great I bought one for my mom too. Very handy for face time if you have your hands full ir just don't want to hold the phone and great for kids to have when they chat with grandma :) they won't fight over who is holding the phone.  Use it in the kitchen when talking to husband. this holds my iPhone 5c and husband's iPhone 6.
1,Love it to keep my IPhone 6 plus fully charged all day
1,Used this on my daughter's ALREADY cracked screen.  It did seem to stop the crack from getting worse.  She got no further damage to her phone while she used this screen protector.  Wished she had this to start with.  Make sure you have a clear work space when attaching the cover.
1,Loved it!
1,Nice case
-1,it does fit for the 6 plus I have the case on right now I love it!
1,Great for traveling without adding bulk!
1,Worked good.
1,"After looking at all of the 'actual' Samsung branded batteries and their inconsistent reviews, I decided to go with a company that puts their own name (and therefore, reputation) on the product.  I'm glad I did!  The turnaround in my battery performance was immediate and distinctive.  I cannot recommend this solution enough for anyone looking to replace their phone battery."
-1,Very cheap. Not what I was expecting at all.
-1,"It broke 2 days after receiving it, the glue started separating"
1,"I love this screen protector, Im always dropping my iPhone and with this screen protector it has not broke, I'm so happy with it."
1,Love these amazing price great quality super fast shipping .
1,Excelente
0,They did not stay in my ears what so ever and the cord was too long for my taste. I ordered them because they were &#34;CNET's pick&#34; but ended up returning them.
1,"Big fan, simple and effective. Both my wife and I are now using it, would recommend it for anyone who spends a lot of time in their car or lives in a state where holding a phone while driving is a no no.<br />Gripper arms are stringer than expected, a secure hold."
-1,All 3 stopped working in the second week of use save your money.
1,"I absolutely LOVE this wireless charging pad.  I purchased this for my S6 Edge and there is nothing bad I can say about it.  When I first got my S6 Edge and realized its wireless charging capabilities I purchased this charger and Samsung's wireless charger to try both out.  This charger has actually been more reliable than Samsung's charger.  It is much lighter, smaller, and slimmer than Samsung's and that is a great bonus for travel.  I really like the charging port on this because it is easily accessible and my cable fits snug in the port without coming free.  I can't say the same for Samsung's.  Overall I would highly recommend this charging port and intend on purchasing more in the future to have in multiple places!"
0,It began to crack and broke when it fell spend more money on a better one trust me
1,Working very good.
1,Works perfectly with my 5s
-1,Didn't fit my phone
1,"I love this handy little device. My favorite feature is the ability to press a button and disable a charging port. This allows me to leave my chargers, cables, and devices connected without overcharging or burning up cables (FYI: A CABLE CAN BE BURNED OUT PREMATURELY IF IT IS LEFT PLUGGED IN WITHOUT BEING CONNECTED TO A DEVICE - via BestBuy Tech). Thanks for a high quality product Bestek!"
1,"Bought this for spouse. She doesn't like smart phones. Works great for her but cannot turn off data like on a smart phone. Had to contact the carrier and have her number blocked from data usage. Overall, good phone."
1,nice new item and fast shipping
-1,This is not the replacement for my current remote alarm set/door opener. I am returning them.
1,Great product! Just as described.
1,I love this case!!!!
-1,This is a ripoff
-1,Its not leather and the metal adapter wont fit... Scratched the inside on the apple watch... Thats what $11 get you.
1,perfect condition<br />Thank You!
-1,At first the case looks and feels great. After a few months the poor craftsmanship starts showing.
1,"I got this phone about 2 weeks ago and it works great so far.  The phone has some minor damage in the corner however the screen has no scratches or chips.  Before getting this phone,  I got one from eBay at a slightly lower price but I ended up returning that one because it was not working -  was not connecting to the Internet.  With this one, I had  no issues  so far,  and I hope it will keep working well."
0,its works properly to adroid phone samsung s3 .<br />calls and text messages works only for iphone 6  and 6+ .<br />overall  ill give 3 stars !  price wisely!
1,"Works exactly as the original...contacted SanDisk first, and they gave me the run a round trying to get a replacement...buying this was much easier than dealing with SanDisk."
-1,"Cable worked fine as a lightning cable - used it in that mode for a couple weeks. Needed to charge an android phone, so popped off the lightning end, used the micro usb end, worked fine. Put the cap back on to charge an ipad, it never worked again. So one use of it as a micro usb cable broke it as a lightning cable. Not exactly a good product."
1,So far so good.  I've had it for a few weeks and it's working great.  The case is sturdy without being bulky. I like the portal placement and functionality as well. The holster holds on tight and the swivel is really nice. My experience has been good and I recommend the product.
1,battery is working great
1,Good solid case.  Would buy it again.
1,Great case for the price. Not as much protected as more expensive cases.
1,"Love my case and I receive so many compliments on it. The only thing I have to say is that with in a few days some areas started to chip. Other than that, Iove this case and it has been on my phone for a little over a month now."
1,Worked for my S4.
1,It came earlier then expected. 😄😄 I love this case its my favorite.
1,It is just what we wanted. Arrived on time with no damage.
1,"I personally don't own an iPhone 5(S) (let alone any iPhone), but I bought this as a gift for someone who couldn't make up their mind about which case to get. That being said, they were naturally happy to receive this case because it afforded them the quality of an OtterBox case to an extent without costing as much. What makes this case even nicer, is that it has swappable plates so he can change it depending on his mood."
1,"I am giving this 5 stars. For the price, you can't go wrong and the sounds quality is really good. the base is deep, sound is crisp and you can hear everything clearly as if it was a wired set. This comes with different sized earbuds and they are comfortable. I think design and cord makes these very light and easy to wear during activities like bike riding, running, gym activities or casual wear. I tested the calls quality and I didn't hear any complaints. For the price and quality I would recommend."
-1,Phone arrived but all settings were in Singapore language.  Could not read anything on Google. Disappointed.
1,"The price was great, it fit the phone and is still working.  Thanks."
1,Excellent product. Recommended!
1,Great simple case!
1,Thank you for the 2-year warranty on my CD player.
1,Super sturdy and works perfectly. No need to remove cds from slots before installing.
1,"Works great with iPhone 6. Does get a little loose when I'm trying to type while leaving phone on stand but, other than that, this product works perfect!"
1,Exactly as described. Holds my iPhone 5s in a case and makes driving much safier and easier
1,Awesome case. Just wish screen protector was a bit more durable.
1,This was a gift for our granddaughter ....she loves it.
1,"love this case! I'm usually all about Otterbox but they seem to have cut a few corners with the new ones. The Otterbox case for my iPhone 5s stretched and didn't work after less than a month. I bought two of these (one for my husband) and I love it. It's slim so it fits in my pocket better. I also love the water resistant feature as we both work jobs where we end up soaked with sweat. Now I can keep my phone on me in case of emergencies and not worry about it being wet with bodily grossness. Lol! My one year old threw my phone across a room with hardwood floors where my dog, thinking it was a game of fetch, promptly ran over and snapped it up. The case had a couple of tiny knicks taken out of it but everything else was fine! The only thing I would change would be to make the backing a bit more like rubber so it catches on slick surfaces. I've also got an a**hole for a cat so even if my phone is out of reach of the kiddo, she'll knock it down for her own amusement. I'd say it's hit the floor pretty hard more than a dozen times because of the cat and my phone has suffered NO damage."
0,Cute and does the job of protecting phone. The color does rub off after a few weeks in the most used parts of the phone. This is very unnoticeable to others and not a big deal.
1,Great charger and would recommend this product to anyone!. It has a small charging cord and pouch. Worth its weight in gold!
1,Bought for spare earpiece. Like the headset so now I can replace the part that takes the most abuse.
-1,"The headline says it all. Don't buy this watch if you are expecting to use the GPS, as it does not work. Search the internet and you will see that this is a known issue and that Sony will do nothing to resolve it (Refund? ha! Warranty repair? Ha!).  What a waste of $200."
1,I research EVERYTHING.  This product seems higher quality than most and has worked fine for me.
1,Great product. Keeps my husband's phone secure and safe!
1,"I would give it 5! I bought this at the beginning of February 2015. I have used this thing basically every day since. I dropped it two days ago and it's unaffected! Still works like a charm. On a completely full charge, I can charge my Samsung S5 and my girlfriend's iPhone and still have enough juice to recharge my S5 two more times.<br /><br />I love this battery do much, I just bought another one and it was delivered today...SUNDAY!<br /><br />5 stars all around. Very dependable, very durable,  it surpasses my expectations at the &#34;under $40&#34; price point.<br /><br />Well done!"
-1,"Pos! Would not support iphone 6 anymore after owning it since November, suppose to have 1 year warranty, when I called customer service he told me they would do a one time exception and refund it (excuse me but what about my warranty).  Will never buy this again and they should stand by their products! Wish I could give the whole experience a zero"
1,excellent
1,we had one already and it broke so we ordered another shipping a little too high but good product overall
1,Everything I had expected and more.<br />So glad I ordered it.
1,"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
-1,Doesn't hold a charge
1,"Much larger than I expected and won't seem to charge a device while it's charging for some reason, however a previous model would.As for working on the go like previous models it's amazing. I would suggest including either the mini usb to iphone adapter or that cable as well.I know other vendors include a duo cable.The bag was really cool, it's over sized so you can fit an extra charger, usb wall charger and my phone with extra room. I would have given 5 stars but I think the not charging issue while plugged in and not including the iphone adapter or duo cable makes this product great but not quite perfect.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Eric"
1,100%
1,My LG g3 look gorgeous I love........
1,On time Delivery and the product is as described. Happy customer
1,"Bought these cables to work with several iPhones in our house that live inside Lifeproof cases.  Fits perfectly!  Thank you!  I love the idea of the Lifetime Warranty as these cabels (mostly the Apple originals) wear out quickly.  I hope to never have to call in on my warranty, but happy to know they are there.  I know where I am coming to purchase cable replacements the next time a non-Luxtr cable wears out.  Thanks again!"
1,"Nice cover, fits perfectly."
1,Very good
1,Fast shipping and wonderful product !
1,"good value, made well"
1,3 or 4 charges per charge
1,Works as it says!
1,Excellent
1,"Very sturdy case, easy to grip. I recommend this for any LG phone owner."
1,"Bought 4 of these, they work great, provides plenty of power for dual devices."
0,"Only received ONE screen protector when clearly, the description says &#34;3-pack.&#34; I've contacted Tech Armor, and they haven't coordinated a replacement yet."
1,I bought this hub because we were going on a trip to Italy and I didn't want to carry a charger for everything we needed to charge. It worked out perfectly. Once we met up with friends there I left it in the living room and everyone was charging their phones on it.
1,No issues. Went on easy and stayes clear.
1,Love it. Very cute
1,"A definite buy if you're looking for inexpensive, reliable, good-sounding bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />I previously used the Beats in-ear headphones during my workouts. I wanted a set of bluetooth headphones to avoid having to worry about the cord in between my iPhone and headphones. These headphones fit the bill perfectly. They obviously don't sound as good as the expensive Beats ones, but they are good enough for workouts. They do a terrific job of isolating noise, so I don't recommend them for running outside. Inside, like the gym or on a treadmill, they are perfect for isolating you from the rest of the world. I have no problem with them staying in my ear while running or lifting weights. The key is to try the included, different sized-earpieces to get the best fit. Battery life is good, they last about 3-4 hrs; I only keep them powered while working out.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes."
1,It is what I expected. Not the best feel to the plastic
1,"This is perfect for somebody with way too many electronic devices, just like me.  This is the way I use this: I drilled a hole in the back of the top drawer of my nightstand and threaded the power cord of this port to the power outlet in the wall and then the port hangs out in my nightstand drawer connected to my iPad, mobile phone, Kindle charger and fitbit charger.  I can store all of these ugly cords out of sight and let everything charge at once in my nightstand drawer every night.  I love it!"
1,Better than I imagined it would be. This is a high quality band that looks and performs as well as the official Apple band. Only difference is its a fraction of the cost.
-1,It does not get the gps signal
1,This case fits my phone perfectly.  It was pretty simple to put on.  My edge functions are still visible and all aspects of the phone are still able to be used.  I wish the color was different but it protects my phone.  The case is still slim enough were I can put my phone in my pocket if I need to.  I received this at a discount to try in exchange for my honest review.
1,Excellent
1,My one complaint is that it picks up winds noise pretty bad. The range and battery life is good. Audio quality is good. It's odd how doesn't go into your ear like an ear bud does.<br /><br />Over all I'd recommend it.
1,"I haven't heard what someone sounds like while using this, but people I talk to through it say they can't tell that I'm on speakerphone."
1,Nice phone for the price.
0,"Quality is OK. Power button hides behind binding  (must open case to get to it),  taking photos is awkward (cover flips back & obscures lens : must hold like an open wallet to photograph ),  needs some sort of clasp to keep it closed. Unsure about battery saving &#34;close case to hibernate&#34; feature. Does it save enough battery to justify inconvenience of regularly opening/closing front cover? Corners not completely covered (that's where I usually get damaged in drops). Attractive,  slim. A bit expensive for the many quirks."
1,"I had a blu phone before but this one is exceptional phone, it weighs more than what I had before, I like it and the price is so convenient"
-1,After 2 months of use the case all front edges came out. The case now looks useless and ugly.
-1,"Great case itself! But too many problems. One, the headphone jack was too small and so i bought a thin jack extender which was pointless cuz it still wouldnt fit. Two, the silent on and off button was way to narrow. Three, the charging cord was too much of a problem and only was able to use the iphone charger. Four, the price and quality is great but not worth it for the problems that comes with it"
-1,DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL
1,"This little adapter works like a champ.  Our teen's laptop audio port got goofed up so we can't plug headphones into it any more and it turned out to be prohibitively expensive to repair.  We can plug headphones into this device, then send the laptop's audio to it via Bluetooth.  Works great."
1,I like this case it's what it comfortable and fit exactly perfect on my iPhone 6 Plus I'm very happy with this case
1,"I needed a case for  my oversized work issued LG Vista G cell.<br />Arrived less than a week after ordering.This is a good value and<br />PERFECT for my needs!The fabric body/metal clip combination makes<br /> all the difference.This case is rugged,solidly built and comfortable while<br /> clipped to my waistband on the job.I'd had an all plastic holster case for<br />a previous phone(Samsung Galaxy III mini ); that holster case<br /> was awkward to handle and uncomfortable on my person AND<br /> the plastic clip broke.<br />I highly recommend it for larger, hard to fit phones."
1,"This product is fantastic. For 13 dollars you get a very large amount of battery, enough to hold many charges. Buy this product. You will not regret it."
1,Love it
0,It breaks easier than the first one but it was way easier to change the second time
1,works as expected very long
1,Perfect
1,These are great screen protectors. My mobile provider doesn't sell the correct size in store so I first wasted $12 for one that didn't fit...  Finding this excellent alternative online was perfect! Fast shipping!
-1,Doesn't look like the picture but I like it
1,"The design and quality of this case is really excellent. This case will protect your phone from just about anything you can throw at it. You can put your phone in this case and not need to worry one bit about damaging it.<br /><br />So far I've taken this iPhone 6 adventure/underwater case with us to the water park and the lake, and the pictures have all turned out awesome. The picture quality while using this case is far better than I expected it to be. The four lenses are all excellent. They take really outstanding pictures. I particularly like the pictures taken with the wide angle lens.<br /><br />I can't imagine there being a better adventure/underwater case with lenses out there. We have been nothing but happy with it. This is a terrific adventure/underwater case. Highly recommended.<br /><br />If you have any questions about this adventure/underwater case, please feel free to ask, and I'll try my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful."
1,Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
-1,Can't hold weight of Samsung Note 4
1,love this the letter feels amazing had it for 2 years now and still looks as good as it does when I got it now if not better than
1,This is like a new phone<br />Perfect
1,"Great item but one of soft rubber pieces can off after one trip, would definitely buy again!!!"
1,Works great!
1,cord to charge is really picky. only charges my iPhone 6 to 100% two times.
1,"Great product, good price."
1,Love this case!
1,"The headset has the most awesome sound and, it takes 10- 15 to charge it for 5 hours. Comfortable to wear, sound is great. I love it. Well worth the amount I paid."
1,Is very good looking so nice good quality of phone case thank you
1,I've had it for about 2-3 weeks now & it's still hanging tough. I dropped my phone face down at work and my screen is still fine & the case has the smallest scratch on the top left corner ( barely noticeable ). I enjoy the mini stylus it came with too. Definitely worth 8 bucks.
-1,Said it for iPhone 5s.  Bulls***. Was for iPhone 4. Too expensive to return
1,Its 100% protective but adding this makes phone heavy..
1,"Expensive, and takes 2 weeks to get, but it seems Apple products only charge correctly with factory Apple charge cords, which is a shame."
1,Good as otterbox
1,"I give 5 stars because the performance of this phone is excellent having in consideration the price,LTE,OS lollipop ,fast respons etc.No complaint for battery and camera didn't expected first quality for the price I paid"
1,"Nice and will help protect the tablet, but is heavy!!"
-1,Breaks too easy.
1,"This case came fast and is very good quality. I'm using it for an Alcatel One Touch Icon Pop, as had read a couple of reviews saying it would fit ok. I easily cut out pieces over the volume and off/on switches on the right side, so it's easier to use those buttons now. The case is very good protection against damage, plus I've gotten compliments on how attractive it is."
-1,"Thought this was going to be a great case but a week in to using it, the plastic that holds he phone in place started to break. Now my phone no longer stays in place."
1,This product does what it is supposed to do and my search is now finally complete. I have always been looking for earphones that would not fall out of my ears during my runs and these do the perfect job. I was going to spend $100+ on some earphones but good thing I purchased these instead. I have used these on multiple runs and they never fell out of my ears. Without this add on the Apple earphones would always fall out of my ears when I am running since I sweat a lot.
-1,Got what I paid for. Super cheap. Broke within days.
-1,"This case is very rugged and protects the iPhone very well, but the built-in screen protector makes the phone very difficult and frustrating to use.  The screen protector doesn't sit directly upon the phone's screen, there is a tiny bit of airspace between, so you have to push in with a bit of force to do anything with the phone.  This makes texting, zooming in or out, scrolling etc. all difficult.  The home button is also covered by a thin membrane, so Touch ID doesn't work as well as usual either.  I read online about removing the built-in screen protector and using a thin glass one instead, but decided it would be easier to just return it and find a different solution."
1,Love this design!
1,"Great battery, great company"
1,"Okey, thumps up!"
-1,"Will not charge iPhone or iPad, junk, do not buy this."
1,Cute and powerful
1,good
0,"Takes a lot of room, too heavy for long term mounting"
-1,"Worst headphones ever.<br /><br />They skip music all the time: while walking, while pulling your phone from your pocket, while sitting down, while standing up, while turning. You get the picture. No sudden movements, or the audio skips.<br /><br />Terrible: after just 3 uses, the USB-power side cable removed itself from the unit - see photo.<br /><br />And what's weird and unexplainable: these headphones randomly click buttons on my Android smarthphone, and send map location data to unknown Google Hangouts recipients - also see photo. I mean, I could click the &#34;power&#34; button on the device and it would send random interactions to the phone, like clicking ads in Spotify or opening Maps. Not cool.<br /><br />I'm returning."
1,Excellent
1,"Its the best i Ever had. I had broke the first one, and i ordered another one. Dropped my phone on the floor twice ,and the glass did not shatter."
1,The best solid cables!!
-1,"The back scratches really easily.  It scratched up on the first day I got it.  Also, it has a very small edge so when I dropped my phone for the very first time, it cracked my tempered glass screen protector.  I think it was because the tempered glass screen protector was actually sitting slightly higher than this case's edge.  If the edge on this case had been a little higher, the case would have protected it from hitting the screen on the ground. I purchased an otter box after this.  It's much better!"
1,Nice product.... Works well
1,Very fun. Needs more foam around the nose and sides for it to be wearable for a long time.
1,Really good quality glass came very quickly highly recommended
1,"Went on easy, fits pretty well and I love the color. Has some exta cutouts but they don't bother. Ok for the price."
1,Excellent
1,looks great and professional
1,Works great. Everything needed to replace the charging port cover
1,meets my needs
1,"This review has taken me a while to write,first I gave this phone as a gift to my father. He is over sixty years old and has little to no tech savvy when it comes to cell phones. I wanted to get him an unlocked cellphone so he would not have to worry about the price tag or when he decides to change carriers. He absolutely loves this phone. First of all, the screen is HUGE, I have a LG G2 and it makes my screen look small. It comes in very cool colors and it is actually quite sleek. The apps and software on the phone are not to bad. So if you like having a nice cellphone, but you may not be too tech savvy this is definitely for you. Also, the phone is an amazing deal. You get a great, stylish phone, and you get a screen protector, as well as, a cell phone case. This phone is truly great. When my father went to go get a sim card and showed it to one of the employees, the employee fell in love with his phone. Honestly, I would have gotten this phone for myself if I had known it was so cool instead of paying $400 dollars on my LG.  This is a most definite yes, If I could I would live to advertise this cell phone and the brand"
0,Basic cover for back of iPad mini however is overly easy to attach and remove (could see it falling of if dropped).
1,I love this case.  The color is exactly what I expected.  It appears as if I purchased a new phone. The grip is nice and it provides protection for my phone.
1,Not strong enough for me
-1,it looked nice but it was pretty low quality and came in broken
1,"I think this glass looks better than the $20 one I got talked into buying at the Verizon store. That one had broke in about 2 weeks, so I needed a replacement. So far so good. It was super easy to put on my phone. The sticker guides that come with it made it super easy to line up perfectly."
1,"Exactly what I was looking for a full featured standard size smartphone at considerably less price.  The phone is in perfect condition looks just like new.  For phone service I use Tracfone &#34;Bring Your Own Phone&#34;.  Since it's a second phone I just do 90 days at $20, roughly $6.66 a month.  I had a SIM chip from Tracfone already for Verizon type phones.  We have WiFi here which covers a lot of my use."
1,It is really good and I recommend
1,"Charges my phone quickly and the phone senses it's a quick charger, it's great!"
1,"I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest. I love this product, the size is a little bigger than expected but that's ok. Taking it out the package and plugging it in is easy and very simple. This product is perfect for if you want to charger to things at once without having to plug 2 single USB port and taking up room. Although it is a little big it has its perks. I love how it's fast charging port definitely charges my devices faster. There are light indicaters on it, green means fast charging, blue means slow charging/standby. I am overall impressed with this product and would definitely buy it again. 😀 using this at the moment"
1,"Works exactly as intended, cheap, and nice looking.  My daughter loves it."
-1,I had high hopes for these cords but my first one only lasted about 3 weeks. Maybe I'll have better luck with the next two but so far not a good purchase. So disappointed! :(
0,Doesn't charge the device very quickly when plugged in but works fine. I wish it was clearer that I needed to plug it into a power source for it to work.
1,"I choose the CD mount for my 3 Series sedan due to positioning on the center stack. I had to use scotch tape to secure the plate in the case. Simply put, the holder works. The CD mount is really secure. I have no issues pulling the phone off the magnet. I will be buying another mount for our other car."
1,Still using it awesome
1,Great but you have to be careful sitting down or squeezing by someone
1,"Easy to install, fits fine"
1,Great for price only been using one at the moment but the head where you plug it in your phone slides off and on but still charges phone fine
1,Excellent.
0,Decent case.
-1,"looks ok except for the letters on the back , they should leave the back blank without the white writing it spoils the case"
-1,"Piece of junk! It actually sucks the life out of the remaining battery in my phone!!!! I thought maybe it was just my car but I tried it in my husband's as well and it does the same thing! Before I plug in my phone it says I have 17% remaining battery life, after I plug it in & check it in 10 minutes it says 12% remaining!!! I though hmmm.... maybe I just need to leave it on longer & wait.....NOPE!! In the next half hr it was completely DEAD!!!"
1,I love this case. I have a 3year old and she has dropped my phone a few times. She even threw it and there was not even a mark on the case let alone the phone. Its a great case for a great price.
1,"I've dropped my phone more times than I can count and most times it's completely fine (and trust me, there's been some pretty bad falls). Two times, the screen has shattered. Or so I thought. Turns out it was just the screen protector. I really believe if the screen protector hadn't been on there it would have been my screen instead. This screen protector is WELL WORTH it and definitely does the job!"
1,"I had recently upgraded my phone from the S3 to the S6. Most of the time when holding my S6 with one hand and at an angle to get a better view at what I am reading or viewing, the phone slips off my hand and falls down to the floor. Not good at all. Since my phone is new, I was afraid for it to get damage from constant dropping on the floor. I bought this Samsung Galaxy S6 phone case by Collen in gold color. The color gold is transparent but the color is still visible. The material made out of it is really nice, pliable, and seems durable. The material is not too thick which I really like. It does fit like a glove on my S6 and my phone in this protective case does not slip off of my hand! I do recommend this product, it comes in different colors. I chose the gold and it gives my phone a more classy look to it. My husband  even commented on how nice the case is and wants one for his Note 4. I am glad to have purchase this product and have waited for the perfect opportunity. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my own honest opinion."
-1,i go to plug the charger in my phone and it doesn't work..
1,can't beat the price
1,It works fine and the iPhone doesn't show any incompatibility message.
-1,Does not work with iphone at all.
1,Perfect fit. Classy.
1,"love love love!!!  This has solved my problem of going out or shopping and not wanting to take my purse with me.  Holds a folded bill, drivers license and credit card.  So now all i need are my keys, and phone and I am ready to go!  At least once a day someone remarks about my wonderful case! Highly recommend!"
1,Great case for my oversized HTC ONE Max! Keeps phone safe and dry - took to ball game and stayed nice and dry through the rain!
1,"This flat USB A to USB MIcro B with a Micro B female to Lighting Male adapter works with just about any of my devices. IOS, Android or Windows. One cable to rule connect them all for power and sync.<br /><br />The cable feels expensive, though it's quite fairly priced. It comes with nice covers to protect the connectors. I expect these will get lost but they are a nice touch for a travel cable that may get banged around.<br /><br />Unlike most USB and lightning cables this is a flat cable. It rolls nicely and so far seems more resistant to becoming a &#34;rats nest&#34;. The USB A and Micro B connectors and the Micro B femaile to Lightning male are all finished in a soft-feel grey finish. The connector grips feel rich and nice.<br /><br />I like this cable and now I don't need pack at least 2 cables to connect all my travel devices for sync and charging. When I'm traveling little things like this make more of a difference than I would have thought. Once less thing toe keep track of and it works great so far.<br /><br />Because it makes my life a bit more simple and works well for me I'm handing this lighting/micro USB B cable 5 stars.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!"
1,I bought the wrong case but it looks very protective lol
1,Excellent
-1,"I was extremely pleased with the fit and appearance of this case, but the plastic framework that holds the phone in place on the top left side broke with a few weeks.  I glued it back together, and it has broken again, about an inch from the the first break.  I love the case itself, but am disappointment that the framework that holds the phone is so weak.  Is this typical of this case, or did I perhaps get a defective one?"
1,Bottom of case where charger connects broke of within a month
-1,Side button on both sides are very hard to push I also have one for a iPhone 6 plus that is the same way I've been using it for about a month and I'm not too happy with this product. Color options were good but that's it
1,Overall a good case firm fit very thin only drawback is that when the back side of it is squeezed against the back of the phone (it always is bec of firm fit) it creates  a smudgeyy kind of  look very unappealing.
-1,I want my money back first it was not even readable and it was fragile
1,"In case you do not know, the entire case is not SOLID plastic. This is a GOOD thing. It is hard plastic on the corners and sides. It is not plastic (and is some sort of rubber material) on the places where normal hard plastic cases break. It makes the phone look &#34;rugged&#34;. The kick stand works fantastically."
0,the quality is not so good.
1,I absolutely love this phone case!!!!!!! I get so many compliments on it and would definitely repurchase it again. The price and shipping for this product was great!!
1,"Hard to say if it helps or not, I think I have slightly better reception. For the price you cant really go wrong."
1,Great screen protector. Went on easy looks perfect.
-1,Damaged when arrived
1,"Very stylish and sturdy, and funny too."
1,👍
1,"I got two styluses that both have replaceable tips.  You get extra tips when you buy these styluses.  However, I bought extra tips in case they stop making this kind of stylus in the near future because I've had that happen before.  And as far as I know, the styluses only come in pink and purple.  Maybe they offer more colors now."
1,Great product. Holds up to my 16yr old :)
1,WORKS JUST PERFECT FOR MY LG 4G STYLO PHONE
-1,"I bought this set on Amazon July 10, 2015 and went dead August 24 2015. I went to see if i could return it but read that it was too late to return. I was very disappointed with this product and Amazon should keep away from this type of product. Don't waste your money. It worth less than a star."
1,Very well made case! I love it
-1,"This product flat out doesn't work.  The suction cup doesn't suck onto tiles in pools, and you can't hear anything under water."
1,"Grips my phone well and unlike some other mounts, allows me to change the angle easily. Because it sticks out a bit from the CD slot, it does bounce and flex a bit over rougher roads, but it's still usable."
1,nice as expected
1,wish you make it a little wider so the otterbox can go in it
0,it was ok but not quite what i needed it to be
-1,The wound quality for music is good. Has great bass. But phone wise my calls would breakup. Fully Charged only lasted half the day and most of the time it was on standby
1,works great.
1,"I love it, it's perfect!"
-1,Doesn't work with my HTC
-1,"Broken, better selfie sticks on the market."
1,Just right.  Arrived quickly.  Definitely very durable; I had the same brand case for an iPhone 4.  And you can't beat the price!
1,"i bought this charger last year but rarely used it, I think I had only recharged it to full 3 times and used it to charge my Samsung phone less than 10 times throughout the year. Now it's so dead wont charge nor being charged. Huge shame it is really piece of junk and what the manufacturer is doing to the environment producing these junk  Update: after previous review Anker sales contacted me immediately and sent a replacement. The replacement works so far and I hope it won't  fail after few use again. They also addressed my concern about the disposal of the faulty one, they paid postage to ship back the faulty piece. I am happy with how I was treated and update my review here"
-1,"This jammed in my car's radio as soon as I put it in - I can't comment on sound quality, as I've had no way to test it. Quite a disappointment, given the other positive reviews."
1,I love it.
1,"I've had used different devices from iPhones to Galaxy Notes, iPads and BlackBerrys but boy I'm glad I took a leap and went to BlackBerry! This is the best phone ever. It runs Android apps so you won't miss those productivity apps you have on your previous device(s).<br /><br />Somebody had a great review here so I won't even try to convince you. I will just say, get the device, use the device and then give your verdict. It's awesome!"
-1,"Quite disappointed with the suction cup because it does not hold that strong. It always fell, if not on the dash board on the floor. I just put it aside."
1,"Easy to place and microphone easily. We have I phone 6, note 3 and note edge it fit all 3. Held onto phone during drive and you can angle it fo better viewing. The really nice part is it can be easily moved to where you need it instead of being stuck to the dash like a p previous one."
1,It last for five hrs. Come with a wire to CHARGE  your earphones. For those who are new to bluetooth earphones.
1,Just what I needed
1,I love this case!
1,My Iphone is protected now :)
1,Nice neat cover. Not intended to be a wallet
1,Great bargain - works great!
1,Good product
1,I feel confident if I dropped my phone in this case (which I have done accidentally) it will protect it.
-1,"I loved the case when I first received it, but within 48 hours two rhinestones came off the back and the case is very hard to get on/off my phone."
1,"Great case, great price. Very happy with it!"
1,Holster is not the same in the picture but still awesome!
-1,Too heavy to carry on...:-(
0,The  product it self is good it just doesn't cover the entire screen it come short I think they need to redesign in order to cover entire scree length wise and  sideways
1,Awesome I got 2x solar panels. It comes 2x sockets to charge your tech. I notice it charge my stuff at light (inside lights) weird but awesome.
1,"Brilliant colors, soft case.  I can see it working well."
1,As described
1,Did everything as advertised; clean/minimal addition to the dashboard.
1,Good product
-1,"The worst case ever , don't  buy it don't feet the phone."
1,"I got this just to help with how slippery the Note 5 is and it definitely helped with that. The S Pen is still easy to get in and out, the bottom speaker is not obstructed, and the buttons still have that nice click to them. Also, there is just enough lip around the front to help if you drop it face down without making it hard to touch things with your thumb when only using one hand."
1,My friend loves his new phone thank you
1,love it
1,Good!
1,You will have to press buttons harder due to the screen interfering with screen sensitivity. Great screen protector overall. I would definitely recommend.
1,just as advertised.
1,Perfect. Everything you need all in one.
1,The tablet case is wonderful.  It would have been helpful to have assembly instructions.
-1,very bad - wrong items
0,Leather is not top quality.....hope they make better quality
1,"Excellent protector. Against drops, bumps and misuses always protect the most . !"
1,Good product. No issues so far
1,These headphones are great! Got them as a gift and they're so much better than the iPhone ones I had been using!
1,"About the same quality as the cheap 50 star flags you get at Walmart, but since I'm only flying it around Independence Day it should hold up many years. It was only out for one week this year, but we did get a couple of thunderstorms and it survived with no fraying or fading. If your looking for something to leave outside for any length of time I'd look for something better, but if it's going to be indoors or only uses outside occasionally it should serve you well."
-1,Doesn't fit properly
1,"I've only used it once. Seems to work very well. So far, so good."
0,Works but it gets hot.
-1,no it took forever to charge my phone up. it always said 5 hours to charge and have my phone over heated.
1,Awesome
1,"Great case, great looking, feels like the otter box but with less bulk. Finger print feature still works great with it on.One big downfall is they completely forgot to make an opening for the stylus and its alot of effort  to take off to use my stylus.  UPDATE  MINE WAS DEFECTIVE  It looks like they did not cut plastic all the way for my stylus opening but i plan on rectify that with a razor blade."
1,;)
1,"Excellent product, finding more and more uses."
-1,"Bad stuff , they send me a broken one ...I threw it away ..."
1,Very cool and good case!
1,Makes my phone (GSIII) run like it did when it was new. Pleasantly surprised.
1,sweet
1,Awesome and charges my Gear Fit without an issue!
-1,Too small of wire
1,"Lightweight, attractive, solid, convenient -- and it works! This is exactly what I was looking for to charge my Moto X."
1,Fast shipping. Love the colors.
1,Great price and worked well in the ocean surfing!
1,Easy to apply and works great.  Have used it for a few months and it has definitely protected my phone.
1,Made out of strong material.  Great protection for your phone.
1,I use these all the time. Great sound.
1,"Very happy, quality phone at cheap price"
1,Paint hasn't chiped and stand still working.
-1,I'm sorry to inform you that I'm planning on returning this item due to the fact that I haven't been able to pair it to two different phones. Thanks.
1,hooked up working good
1,Satisfied.
-1,"I have the note 5 and doea not cover the screen at all. I took it to Verizon because  I'm really bad to apply screens and it didn't do much better, they advise to return.<br /> Very disappointing actually waste of money<br /><br />Will be returning it."
-1,"just wasn't what I thought it would be, it connects to my phone fine, but I have to continue to download different apps to access all the features of the phone, music app, workout app, a app to download other apps its just too much for one off brand device"
1,What can I say?  Anker's products are top notch.  I'm using this to charge my iPhone 6+ as well as to power my dashcam.
0,Like the blingage
1,very good piece of equipment
1,"Fast delivery , as described nice case"
-1,The application for it does not work and the watch does not connect to the phone properly. I tested it on a Samsung Galaxy S4 and a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active. Only call notification works but the contact name doesn't show on the watch. I will be returning the phone because of false advertising of functionality by the seller. The watch looks nice which is why I gave it 2 stars.
1,I like it a lot
-1,"Terrible. Not the item I ordered at all. The borders I received are white. The Ravens logo and lettering are blurry, and at the bottom there is text that says: 16- Month Plan Ner<br />Septersber 2014-December 2015.<br />I am high disappointed and want my money back."
1,love it for my grandaughter
1,perfect fit. i bought for my mom，its easy to use and really helpful.
1,Works like the factory cable!
-1,"Gets stuck to the screen, and the silence switch breaks off. It is also a pain in the butt  to get it off, DON'T BUY IT."
0,The Phone has been making strange noises while on calls since I started using this case.
0,Can this pair with the lg leon lte?
-1,Please don't waste your money
-1,Did not fit the phone
1,Nice set
1,Great armband carrier for my Note 4. Great 1 year guarantee too! After 9 months of normal wear and tear stitching started to come apart on armband. Contacted Avantree support very quickly received reply. No hassle replacement for new armband just had to pay $6 for shipping of new one!
1,"Put this on my phone as soon as it arrived.  8/29, I accidentally dropped my phone on the pavement.  Landed frontside down, the protector cracked but there was NO DAMAGE to my phone.  I have reordered."
1,"Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! The pattern on my case was slightly off centered, but it's only slightly noticeable. I received many compliments on this case."
0,Loved the look and I know I'm rough on cases but the rubber and the image started to peel pretty quickly  :( expected more from otterbox
1,Excellent product
1,Got this for my mom for christmas she loves it. It can fit into her purse and charges her phone and kindle!
1,It's ok; a very good product.
1,"Excellent product, beside of the small size, I specially like the versatility of the dual function as transmiter and receiver which work perfect! I definitelly recommend it."
1,Nice case..slim design
1,I love it
1,Great for securing your iPhone to a tripod for photos in any setting or terrain.
1,Love the case and at a great price.
1,"Gives new life to my Bose 30pin docking station for my Bose radio.  I plug in the Coolstream, sync to my phone and streaming begins.  Very easy.  The only thing I'd like is an on/off switch.  Once it's plugged in the bluetooth light is always on so I have to remove it from the dock when done.  Not a big deal but I'd rather have a way to switch it off.  Great little product and does it's job really well - do not hesitate to buy."
1,Excellent
0,"My wife owned a similar product that she used on her LG G3 and loved it so I ordered this to use on my LG G4. I am a contractor so I have a very heavy rubberized case for my phone.  This car mount was strong enough to hold my phone on a smooth straight road but my phone would fall off when cornering or hitting a bump.  I traded my wife for hers and since she has a lighter case than I do it works well and hers has a stronger magnet so hers holds mine fine. I think this product will be fine for those having a normal case but if your case is heavy duty like mine, it might not be the best one for you."
-1,Is rubbish need to leave it charging all night so you can use it for two hours plus that can not be recharged in a car as it requires high voltage coriente.<br /><br />es una basura necesitas dejarlo cargando durante toda la noche para que puedas utilizarlo durante 2 hora además que no puede ser recargado en un coche ya que requiere de coriente de alto voltaje
-1,It did not play. Sent it back and bought a different kind
1,it worked
1,Nice case. Love the bright green color. Would buy again.
-1,Ordered this product to replace my current usb charger and the one I ordered stopped working. I attempted to try and return and I cant.
-1,Could not get it to work!  Wasted my money
-1,"It didn't exactly line up on the edges, hung over a bit. And the camera whole did not match, was off about 1/4 inch.."
1,"I really like this case. It came earlier than expected. Nice quality, I like the feel of it and how it looks on my phone."
1,Good
-1,Too thick for the Home button.
1,So far so good love it
1,Great Product will do business again!!!
-1,I ordered the case and it was a clear case with a matte paper sticker on it
-1,"no stars, terrible sound, no one can hear me on my phone with this case."
0,This product advertises traffic monitoring but in reality it only uses &#34;traffic maps&#34; to analyze patterns. These maps do nothing for a city like Atlanta where accidents happen daily. I suppose part of the blame could be on me for not researching the details of the product features but when I see &#34;traffic maps&#34; I assume it is in real-time. In reality I am required to buy a second device that must fit into a cigg lighter port (which is broken in my vehicle) so this device was useless to me.<br /><br />The battery is also very shot-lived with only 1-2 hours before a charge is needed..<br /><br />If you are going to spend this much on a GPS device I'd suggest spending just a little more and getting the device that has &#34;real-time&#34; traffic built in.
0,We got this case on 6/28/2015. My son dropped his 5C last night (8/30/2015) and his screen cracked.
1,Works perfect on my phone and is a great alternative to an Otterbox.
1,This is a good dash cam but there no book or  any thing on the web on this. It is teach you self.
-1,Low price does not excuse low sensitivity with low audio to boot. Cant hold on 2 bars via AT&T . Intermittent audio capture etc.. Only thing worse is the weak response from the supplier. Amazon comes to the rescue...  G. Perry
1,Three words ... Best case ever. Or these three would work too ... I love it!
1,Temper glass looks and feels great on my phone. Only issue I had with this was the procedure from not peeling off correctly. Other than that is great ď
1,It's works very well
-1,They fit great. Very adjustable. Very light.<br />I returned them.<br />ALL TREBLE. NO BASS.<br />Unbelievable.
-1,Complete crap. The thing doesnt even fit in the cigarette lighter in my car.
1,Fits great
1,Great product for the price. Keep one in my purse at all times. Works quickly and easily. Couldn't ask for more.
0,You need to make sure it is attached to the dash securely it holds well. However I have had a minor problem with the release button for the grabber arms.  Not a big problem.
1,My husband loves this iPhone case!
1,5 stars if thinner
-1,To thick
1,"Ok so far, material could be more sturdy but no regrets."
1,alsome cases.
1,Works as indicated. Great product. Charges cellphones very fast when installed on wires that go straight to the battery as I had on my motorcycle.
1,"These are great!  I accidentally dropped wire cutters on my phone.  They gashed/cut the screen protector, but my phone screen was unharmed."
0,"It was exactly the color and style I wanted,  but the paint on the sides started to chip after only 1 week of getting it"
1,Comfortable and nice looking. Phone has been dropped a few times and it has been protected from any damage. The colored corners have cracks in them from the drops but has not compromised the cases overall integrity.  ...would recommend.
1,"They fit fine on RCA female jacks. However, they are hard to remove if you change your mind; I wished they had a knob attached so you could pull them off with ease, like with some Firewire and e-Sata connector covers.  Still they do the job."
-1,"Not at Twelve South regular standards, just as many in here and as the pictures show, the soft touch on the case is gone and the wallet is falling apart after a month, i got a replacement from twelve south which followed the same fate as the first wallet. This product is such a disappointment. I've had Twelve South's book book since they brought it out to market and they always been a great crafted wallet. This version for the Iphone 6 is complete crap. Don't waste your money unless they bring back the quality wallets they used to have."
1,"I absolutely love this case! It took me a day before I realized u could remove the phone from the wallet &that the case around the phone matched the pattern of the wallet. The magnets are strong &work great! There are 4 magnets that hold the phone case to the wallet. The wallet part is awesome, has multiple sections for $ etc. Even a spot for change! My ID &credit cards slide in &out when I need them nice&easy. The magnet that holds the phone&wallet shut is awesome! It never doesn't stay closed. My mom bought a similar but diff case for her phone &the magnet stopped working completely so it's always flopping off the side. Deff not a problem w/this one! The ONLY partially bad thing I can say about this case is that I had the wallet/case open &it fell off a table &my screen got a hair crack across it. It's not even noticeable tho as I didn't even realize it had cracked until the following day & i thought it was a piece of hair at 1st. This isn't even something that I blame on the case though seeing as how it isn't designed to be a protective type of case. I think if it had fallen with the case closed &the outer magnet had been secured, I don't believe it would've cracked from that fall. All that being said, I would absolutely recommend this case &I actually even wanted 2get another 1 in a diff design but there wasn't 1 I liked/wanted enough. I've pretty much stopped lugging around my heavy purse as well since I got this because it holds everything I need! The wrist strap is wonderful as well! Obviously I can't say enough about this purchase &deff don't regret it. Only regret is that I didn't make up my mind &buy it sooner!!"
0,"1) These replacements are not going to be the same quality as the original iPhone glass. The first one of these I bought cracked after a couple months while hanging out alone in my pocket. I have absolutely no idea how.<br /><br />2) Sometimes you get a faulty one. The second one I bought had lines on the display and wouldn't accept any touch input. So if you install one of these and your iPhone stops working, don't despair - you probably didn't break your phone. Just send the part back and get a replacement.<br /><br />That being said, it works well enough and comes with all the tools you need. I would just suggest getting a good case if you don't already have one, because you'll need to be more careful with your phone after installing this."
1,"This case is awesome. The colors are a great combination that you just don't see together very often. I love that the case came with a stylus, that matched the case. The stylus is nice & thick, so it's easier to hold onto than some others that I have had in the past. My phone fits in the case very well. I will say that at first, the case is rather stiff, however, I was able to get it more pliable once I bent it and worked where it folds quite a bit. That didn't take too long, either! There are many times that I don't want to have to carry my purse or wallet with me when I'm going into the store, so I'll take my money & put it in the case, along with any cards that I might need, and that's great! I can NOT get my phone to fall out of the case, and I have tried, hard, it just won't come out! I did notice that if you place too many bills in the case, it won't close properly, because you do have to fold the bills in half, but I try not to have too many on me at once anyways, so it's not really a problem with me. I am able to carry 2 credit cards (or my credit card and ID should I need my ID - I still get ID'ed to buy alcohol, which is awesome) and my money also. The clasp, that holds the case together, will also attach to the back should you need to make a phone call or something, that way it's not getting in the way while you're trying to talk. The case also came with a carrying strap, which attaches to the case by a lobster claw, and it's a lime green that matches the clasp and the inside of the case!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,Perfect fit for my iPhone 6+ and Apple Watch. Apple Watch charger fits exactly and with no fuss and iPhone is more than secure. I completely recommend 100% buying this if you are in the market for an Apple Watch stand.
-1,"At first glance these look like high quality, sturdy cables.  Maybe the wire part even is, but the micro connectors let them down. Of 3, 1 didn't work straight away, 1 broke the tip off after 1 weeks use, and 1 only charges if you &#34;jiggle&#34; it right."
1,"Nice protection, not bulky, and with a stand-up strut, too."
1,Inexpensive but functional
1,works great
1,Very good product. Perfect fit.
1,"They aren't as well made as the others I have bought, but for the price, they are great. I can afford to use them for a while and throw them away."
1,Tabs broke easy
1,I love it!
0,Used once at a swap meet which is a large parking lot reception was choppy and slow responses
1,"these are great when traveling. But i use mine daily, i love it"
1,"My friend love it, wish would got a different color than black.... too much with the deliver charge tho..."
1,Nice holder
0,Bought these for my wife and they are huge in her ears. She tried a few of the replacement buds but still felt huge and clunky in her ears. Wife is 5ft tall and petite. For me they seemed fine. Then again I am a very all and big guy.<br /><br />Other than that they look sleek and nice can't speak to the quality or performance as we did not pair it. Going to return this today.
-1,doesnt charge at all
1,Better than the more expensive versions and fits well in a small purse. Great for concerts!
1,"This is the best case!!  It beats the otterbox case that I had, by far.  Very happy with product and delivery!!"
1,Aw vice was great. Received package in a timely manner. Thanks so much!!
-1,The product comes with two cables and one samsung wall plug charger. Out of the two cables that it came with only one works for me. The other one does not even register when you try to use it.
-1,Doesn't fit the turbo phone at all
0,The charging stand didn't work so I couldn't charge these and had to return them.
-1,Nice phone... Cant get ahold of seller to see bout my return
-1,Cover didn't fit the phone there are different mototolla phones mine is a droid maxx which this cover was to small
1,Just exactly what I needed.  So glad I could find this cell phone holder.
1,"Love this case!  Holds phone, money, ID."
-1,Where are the pictures for this phone? All I see is a bedroom set.
-1,Wish it would pick up iPhone
1,"Same troubles as others with the charger cover. Seems a little loose on the bottom of the phone, but this is a very thin case and is good for small drops so the phone does not get scratched. These phones are big of course so a thin case is nice and this one is priced nicely. Comes with a film cover for the back also to keep sand or dust from getting in the case from your pockets and scratching up the back of the phone."
1,It's a good stereo  and economic.
1,It's is good
1,"I really like this case, it fit perfectly and everything lined up exactly. I think it should do a nice job protecting my phone."
-1,Cheap
1,Cheap but ok
1,Great case to protect the Ipad. Could have been perfect if it had magnetic holder/ clasp built into the cover.
-1,"I installed the replacement parts as instructed but once I turned on the screen, I noticed that the color looked washed out and that the phone's temperature monitor no longer worked. For me, these were minor inconveniences that I could live with since this is not a genuine Samsung replacement part, but rather one designed and produced by a third party. You can tell because the word &#34;Samsung&#34; is covered by tape when you get the replacement unit and there are minor differences in terms of the size of the home button, top speaker, etc. between the original Samsung and this unit. It worked like this until a few days ago when the home button and the back button ceased functioning and the screen would turn on randomly by itself. This started happening less than a month after I installed the replacement unit. I have also called the company several times and they have never picked up the call. Every time I am put on hold for several minutes until I just gave up and tried calling back later to no avail. I suggest STEERING CLEAR of this product and buying a cheaper cellphone to tide you over until you can get your cellphone replaced/upgraded.  This is not a cheap replacement and I wish I would have used the money to buy a cheaper cellphone rather than buying this unit to fix my screen."
1,I love it. There was a little difficulty adjusting the ban but that was because I didn't look at the instruction illustration. Once I did it was easy to figure and install. Locking the clasp can be a little tricky. You have to make sure the first part is hooked and snaps in properly before the second clasp will lock in place. Once you get the hang of doing it there's no problem.  Definitely gives the Apple Watch a much classier look than the rubber sports band without having to pay the higher price for the mesh style.
1,"I was hesitant to order this case due to the multiple layers in the photos.  Because of the bending issue, I wanted a solid case for my iphone 6 plus. I also needed a holster case. With this phone, I don't think anyone has pockets big enough... Delivered on time as promised with Prime.  The stylus is a nice extra but not really needed or used on my part. I have had no problems getting the case in and out of the holster and I also have a screen protector on as well.  The corners are all protected and there is a lip which provides protection for the screen.  All buttons work well and all ports are accessible.  No problems with charging or camera /photos. Excellent value for this purchase.  Would buy again and am thinking of buying an extra because the holster clips eventually break at some point."
1,Love these speakers
-1,"We bought your device for our son. He started cross country running for his high school. We loved the device because it tracked his sleep, he's not a good sleeper. It also tracked his workouts for cross country and at home. We would know how to tweek his workouts if we needed to. This past weekend he was at an event for school and his UP fell off his wrist. This has happened before but he would see it happen and catch it. This time he didn't notice that it had fallen off. It is now lost. We are very disappointed in the clasp on the bands. It was the perfect device for what we needed. I would strongly recommend changing the clasp to one that fastens better."
1,Love this case
1,Fit nicely in my sentra no issue with it. Looks ok.
1,beautiful!
1,"I like this product very much. Two lenses are supplied, a fish eye lens, and a wide angle macro lens. They seem strong and well made.<br />For each, there is a snugly fitting rubber protection for when they are not being used, and they come with a small looped cord so that they can be attached to your key chain, to keep them handy until they are needed.<br />They are attached to the phone with a magnetic ring, making them very easy to use, and quick to put on and take off. Several extra rings are included, for your convenience.<br />The quality of the lens is without question—the quality is remarkable, especially given the reasonable price, and we found that if you use the camera's zoom, the macro lens works just like the fish eye lens, an added bonus if for some reason you don't have time to change the lens while photographing.<br />In summary, this is an excellent one. One doesn't usually get top quality design, functionality and a low price all at once, but here, you do--definitely a five star product!"
1,Works great!
1,"Most useful and practical mobile phone mount for a vehicle that I have ever owned. It can be easily moved to different vehicles if the vent mount is used, as opposed to the dash mount. The phone is kept cool by the vent. The phone can easily be placed in a good viewing angle when using maps for travels. The magnet that sticks to the back of the phone is not at all troublesome when the phone is not on the mount. To me it is on the expensive side, but it should be useful for all future phones. All it takes to move the magnet to another phone is replace the two-way tape. A kit is available, but I'll simply use good two-sided tape to mount it again. Such a simple mounting system is overdue!!"
1,Got the one with the Confederate flag on it. He's from Georgia. He loves it.
0,"Great item, only the shipping was terrible"
1,"I love my iPhone 6, so, I have to keep it protected.  This case offers protection while being cute. It is a two layer case. One layer is a pink silicone protector and the other layer is a plastic protector. I love this case. It comes with a clip that your phone slips down in. I am very pleased with the quality of the case. It does not make my phone feel bulky. I also own the black on black case. I love them both! I received the cases in exchange for my honest review."
-1,"Poor quality. It looks cheap, and it is. Also, it does not have a magnetic lock. I didn't realize it before I bought it."
0,it broke but it lasted 1 year
-1,did not work on any smart phone I own..s3 s5 s6 or htc one..refund was simple
1,I am impressed...this small soap-like object really holds a charge.
1,"This is the perfect size for my Samsung Note 4 - It slips into one of the front compartments under the Velcro-fastened front flap.  It's very lightweight but sturdy ripstop nylon material that already sheds water unless it's pouring.  It'll be even better when I spray it with water proofing.  The front slot is a good size for cards such as Driver's license and credit cards.  The zippered compartment is a decent size for a shorter pen, a notebook, coin purse, flash drives, candy, whatever you want  The loop for the belt is double stitched and will accommodate larger belts.  I especially like the extra slot in the belt loop for a carabiner (a small one is in it) and use that most of the time.  It does flop around if I walk fast, but if I put it on a belt, that wouldn't happen.  I received just the right amount of info from the company and it arrived well packaged and earlier than expected.  I've had such a hard time finding anything to carry my Note 4 in that isn't heavy leather and black or brown, this was an especially perfect find.  Mine is a shade more navy than the photo here, but I like that."
1,just enough sticky to keep it on the dashboard...  soft enough that when dropped I haven't broken anything.  I love it.
1,"I was nervous about purchasing this item because of other reviews...but it's the best case I've ever had, and I've had a lot of iPhone cases. The buttons in particular are fantastic. It's like not having a case at all in terms of &#34;tactile feedback.&#34; I can't comment on the size of the holes with headphones etc compatibility since I use Bluetooth for everything, but my charger fits great, and I have no problems with reception.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that the buttons for volume have a piece of tape to hold them in place. That's fine, but the tape overlaps the edge a bit so that you can press the side of the case below the buttons and make the volume adjust. I trimmed the tape shorter and problem solved."
1,Pretty good stuff for the price..
1,"Bought because of the holders to phone, wife took one for her a win win for both of us"
1,Very good.
1,Bought this item for my son off of his Amazon Wish List and he was very happy with the product when he received it .
1,Perfect fit! Exactly what I was expecting!!
-1,Didn't work good and got only $10 off
1,its great i cant wait till it comes it seen reviws of this
1,I got this for my husband. So that he would have a place to set the watch when not using it and because he mentioned that he wanted a case for work.<br /><br />I believe he only wore the case once. He says it does its job he just doesn't like the look of any case on it.<br /><br />He likes the stand it holds the charging cord on there better than a previous one he tried.<br /><br />He wasn't fond of the screen protector mainly because it doesn't give the coverage he wishes it would.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an honest review.
1,Went to Europe over the summer and this case was perfect!!! Held up extremely well and I was gone for 6 weeks. Recommend if u are traveling.
-1,There are not any better then dollar store brand.
1,Fantastic! great purchase
1,Great product!!! Stops charging on occasion
1,Perfect
-1,"ok, but not great.  Doesn't last very long."
0,Decent looking case. Biggest issue is that the headphone jack cut-out is a bit too small. Fits fine otherwise.
1,"I really like this case. Originally when I first ordered it, I was simply buying a case just to protect my phone. But now I'm super happy with it because not only does it protect my phone, but it also looks really cool, and doesn't make my phone bulky like other cases. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it; people think it's one of those &#34;life proof&#34; cases. Also, I like the the little stand that's built in to the back of the case. I recommend this product."
1,wow this thing does the job !!!
1,"Everything fine, nice & useful as expected & good delivery service..."
1,Went on easy enough without bubbles.  Does not fully cover complete front a few centimeters short on all sides.
1,Was as posted
1,Convenient when traveling light.
1,Fast shipping! Easy to install and use to hold my phone instead of it slipping all over and losing it under my seat! Would buy more as gifts!
1,"With four young boys, my phone gets dropped more often than I'd like. This case is fantastic and has protected my phone perfectly."
1,I've now purchased this case twice. I love how it sparkles. I've received many complements over it. My phone fits snugly in the case and I don't have to worry about it falling out. While you cannot fit a lot of cards in you can fit about six comfortably. As I don't like to carry very many cards I find it perfect.
1,"clear and sharp, compact for easy mounting"
1,Fair price-works for around the neighborhood and they are loud and clear and keep their charge.
1,I works perfectly ... I'm glad I got this!
-1,worked fine little while then after 5 months my phone stopped charging the battery then started getting the gray battery of death put back in the oem battery went away.  The phone simply stopped recognizing the battery   (Update july 5th 2016) they sent me a replacement battery same thing happened all over again phone will recognize the oem battery but not the Rav power battery
1,The person I got it for loved it.  Thank you once again for great service.
1,thumb up
1,Good screen saver to protect your Pebble. Easy to apply and squeegee does the trick for smoothing any bubbles. Thanks!
1,I wish you would hold the battery a lot longer but it does give you the strength that you need
1,Awesome case
1,works as promised on my S6/
1,daughter loves it!
-1,"Just for the record, I am a HAM, I have 2 other UV-5R radios, there was no user error involved in this product.<br /><br />Out of the box this radio had no RX audio. The speaker works, cause I could hear the Chinese woman yelling at me, but there was exactly ZERO receive audio, even in simplex. Also, the transmit signal was weak with low audio, and would not hold a repeater what I had line of sight with (the 97 machine located in Paxton MA). Additionally, the antenna and radio began to overheat with probably 3 min of light use, while monitoring on another UV-5R.<br /><br />Bottom line: The radio I received was a total dud. Will re-review if this can be returned and replaced w/o issue."
1,Great cover and does exactly as I suspected; protects my phone completely.
1,"I've had a few Trident cases as I've changed phones along with purchasing ones for my husband.  They are all fantastic.  I've had many cases from the phone carrier store made by different companies that break when dropped or aren't secure.  These are ALWAYS secure, and I have never had an issue with it not protecting my phone when I drop it (or even if I get liquid on it too.)  The rubber with the hard plastic is a great design and very protective.  It's clearly made for people like me who drop their phone all the time because I'm klutzy.  The prices are always very reasonable, which is a plus.<br />It definitely adds some bulk to your phone, but does it in a way that makes you feel like you could throw it against the wall and it would be secure. (Don't do this though.)"
1,"its good, but heavy. so like if you're going on a trip its helpful, but not carrying it along in the shopping mall."
1,Fits and looks great!
1,"Good soft/hard case. This case has 2 layers, one semi-hard rubber case and on top of that a hard plastic case. It has a very sleek design and provides good protection.  I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
1,Fits the phone very well. Highly recommended!
1,works great.
0,"I received my case and it goes on real easy.  I was disappointed in the color as it was no where close to light pink.  It is close to a neon pink.  Also, it add considerable bulk and weight to my phone which I don't like.  I like the kickstand and the wallet feature is a nice bonus.  Still looking for what I want, but will probably not be looking on line since colors don't appear to be true."
-1,"It fit just fine but the plastic is hard and not really absorbent for impacts and made a tough fight to get it on the phone, ended up throwing it away after never using it and loosing the phone it was meant for into a lake."
1,It was nice
1,Awesome product and great price.  Received quickly.  Will work with this vendor again.
-1,Purchased as an interface between my iPad and Apple 5 Phone.  When connected to my car radio it will not allow the music to play thru the radio.  It will charge but that is all.  Useless
1,"I have a iPhone 5s , and this is working great.<br />it small and fits in my pocket . really solved a huge problem for me , my phone was always dead by the late afternoon . this thing will charge your phone and still have power left.<br /> Love it"
1,LOVED THEM AND THE PENS ACTUALLY WRITE!
0,It's fun and arrived fast. The only thing bad is that the fish eye lens is all blurred except for its very center. I'm glad I didn't pay much for it.
1,"i have been eating right and lightly working out. I was using my cell phone but at work a walk and knew I was burning calories but I don't carry my phone on me. I was talking to my husband in passing and than a few days later it arrived. I was so shocked... And in pink!!! I love pink, I'm like a bull with pink. After a few days of using it my husband saw how happy I was and decided to buy one for himself in blue. We love them!"
1,Love it.  This is the third one I have purchased.
-1,I bought it for my new phone Moto G G3. It seems like a cheep case and the worst thing is that it doesn't fit to my phone perfectly in the bottom side. I don't recommend it.
1,Nice product at a very reasonable price<br />Will buy again
1,Great case!
1,heavy duty wire. works well so far
1,Just what I needed
-1,"stickers will not come off, leaves a blurred spot on your screen"
1,approved by wife
1,"Very durable, works great."
0,"*Free Sample provided for review*<br /><br />I was provided a free sample to evaluate and rate the earbud. I have evaluated this over a week and determined its a pretty good set of bluetooth earbud.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easily supports two phones/devices with bluetooth.<br />Small and versatile<br />Very light<br />The earbuds fit perfectly in my ears.<br />Conversations were very clear<br />Voice control was clean.<br />The buttons on the dongle were very responsive and worked perfectly<br />the audio feedback (out of range, power con, connected) were provided<br /><br />Cons:<br />The dongle hangs by your chin - hard to ignore it, Rubs against your face if you turn your face.<br />The standby battery life was about 2 days<br />Use time was about 3 to 4 hours - long flights might require you to carry two.<br /><br />Its labelled as a sport earbud - not sure how that works - when you have an open USB charging port - sweat might seep in to the port and affect - haven't used it for exercise (worried the dongle will be bouncing too much)"
1,Awesome quality
1,great design. instant performance boost over worn old chargers.  built in tech prevents overcharging damage to devices.  have not experienced any loss of charging with multiple devices connected 2 at a time. stays seated securely in car port without getting loose and holds charging cords good and tight .
0,"Broke after two months! Get a jaybird, ITS AMAZING!"
1,Great product
1,I bought this case for my girlfriend. She has had it for less than a month and it has already started to stain from having it in her pockets and in her purse. The case protects the phone just fine. I just wish for her that it was still pink in color.
0,Is the best protection
1,"Item works good, have to remove phone cover to use."
-1,"my camera sucks. even when i do screenshots and send an sms, the megapixels for just awful.<br />This phone doesn't do group texts. if i group two ppl together, i get separate chat logs for each reply i receive back.<br />There's also no quiet hours i can apply like my old windows phone."
-1,Second batch ordered and neither worked as advertised the adapter is too small for the hole in the iPhone6
1,it's an alright case except the screen gets dirty on inside faster than outside and very hard to clean
1,"Very nice size, and it can charge my phone up to 3 times."
-1,"When I ordered it, said nothing about not having an adapter. Now it magically says it"
1,Works great...
-1,Piece of crap! Definitely not 6 amps. My wireless charger charges my s6 edge faster
1,Love it
1,Really liked the durability of this product feels sturdy and strong.  But sound on speaker phone and direct talk was difficult.  No one could hear me. Complained that I sounded like I was in a cave.  Bought for Disney trip. Served it's purpose.
1,"Being that I'm a cellular tech, I have chargers and cables everywhere.  These are actually my favorite ones, mostly because of the connectors and the quality of the cable itself.  The connectors are smaller so they fit inside tighter phone cases, and the cables are well made and haven't been breaking at bending points like many other cables.  I will be purchasing more of these! I am using them with a quickcharge 2.0 charging station and they work amazingly! i also like that they came with two different length cables, that comes in handy!<br /><br />Would purchase again!<br /><br />Note: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review"
1,GOOD.
0,"String broke on a water ride.  Case is huge, but good to put phone with case on it and credit cards/ID when going to water park."
1,"This case for my Galaxy S3 is great. It is a hard case, but the material isn't so slick as to fall out of my hand. It protects all sides of the phone, but doesn't add much thickness to the overall size of the phone - this was really important to me. And all of the cutouts for the buttons and camera fit perfectly. This is a great case and the price made it even better!"
1,Love it! !
1,Very nice thank you
1,"This radio is a great starter for new hams, at a great price. The only reason its not getting five stars is because the antenna is poor- you will need to buy a better and longer one to go with the radio. Other than that, no complaints."
0,"Looks great but horrible quality, wouldnt buy a caseology case again."
0,"The new port and jack were a major improvement. My port got to a point where I couldn't even charge my phone no matter how I fiddled with it, I couldn't get it to charge. I have a couple complaints for this product. Nothing too major but VERY annoying at the same time. First one is about the battery. When doing this kind of repair, it's kinda necessary to remove the battery to ensure proper seating of the dock. I was disappointed to see they didn't include new adhesive necessary for reinstalling a battery. I had to order some because a battery rattling around in a phone isn't normally a good thing. My second complaint is about the tools. The drivers are absolute s**t (The torx driver is fine), the teeth on the Phillips broke after 3 screws. This wasn't much of a problem for myself because I have a large selection of small tools (I would have used them in the first place if I wasn't too lazy to grab them) but I am putting myself in the shoes of a lesser equipped DIY'er. That, and a bunch of metal bits from the Phillips got all over the phone. Thankfully nothing shorted. If you want to go about doing this repair buy this, a set of drivers and some adhesive for your battery. I highly recommend you remove the battery when performing this installation<br />TL;DR: Just buy this for everything BUT the drivers. They SUCK."
1,Good
1,"The band 42mm hold up clearly with my apple watch, this pc is a little larger than the apple watch band but it looks good and fit very well,and the package coming with a link remover if necessory . Let me first say that I do like this quite a bit despite my first experience. This is the second pc I bought to my father. Once you get it fitted, you will fall in love with the look, weight, and feel of this band. The material is strong and sturdy. The finish is beautiful and by no means flashy."
-1,I am unable to rate this product as I have not used it since purchased.  The battery was ordered in the event the charger purchased for phone did not resolve the issue.
-1,I returned this product because the case showed signs of wear after only a few weeks. The color began to wear on the corners.
1,"I got a pair of these because one of my friends recommended them. Compared to the 400$+ Beats Audio they are great! They are loud with little to no interference. I use them running, working out, and normal day-to-day activities!! I love these and for the price you can't beat them!"
1,"Good deal, bought it for my grand daughter she likes it and so cheap.."
1,Love the fit of thia case on my phone
1,"I love this case, it is gorgeous. Lightweight, love the grip, and good protection. The case works great against scratches. It worth the every penny, if you treat your phone like a phone, you won't need any other case. Highly recommended.<br />I got this product at discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
-1,"I do not have a smart phone.  I could not get this to sync with my wireless laptop.<br />I love the design, the fit and numbers, but if I can't sync to anything, it wasn't worth keeping."
1,Works very well. Gets hot when In use though.
1,"It's a nice case, was hoping it would be more protective on the top layer but it's not. I still like it though."
1,Fantastic! Great buy at a great price.
1,Great product. If you have any issues with the kit they provide excellent customer service & respond in a timely manner. I would recommend to everyone !!
1,"Great product and fast delivery. I will be be referring friends and family, as well as ordering again"
1,Perfect
0,Could be stickier... little dissapointed..
1,"We bought them to use with our new RV we needed them for directions in backing up, and my husband and I use them with the headset to talk to each other when riding in the RV, he can not hear me talking to him so they help us to communicate as he is driving."
1,As described. Came in on time! Snugs well. Designed to hold maybe 3 cards but will be hard to pull them out. Over all... its a good buy!
1,Fits great and the screen is fully protected
0,ok
0,"Very tight, even on a very small adult head. Sound quality is OK - not amazing."
0,"Came with screen protector, case, and stylus. Only wish the case didn't brake so easy by the volume button."
1,"This case is very beautiful and the highest quality you can get, if you treat your phone like a phone, you won't need any other case. It is exactly what I need and it is the EXACT color I love! Highly recommended to everyone.<br /><br />I got this product at discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
1,Cons: heavy and takes forever to charge (understandably so)<br /><br />Pros: it's a pretty dang solid charger. I bought it for a vacation to Italy. It was awesome for charging in the airport and while abroad since we didn't have as many plug converters as needed. The LCD screen is probably my favorite part about it. I highly suggest this product.
-1,Cute but a pain to put on take off if you are heavy battery user.
1,works great as a replacement speaker! i needed one for my blown 98' Dodge ram front speaker. does the job just fine!
1,Pleased with product .
0,"Purchased 2, both worked well as far keeping the phones dry but 1 got extremely cloudy and could no longer be used to take photos. Had to return it."
1,thanks
1,Condition was better than advertised but the phone will not update to current version of OS.  Will have to do some research as to why it's not on 5.0...I may just need to be hooked to a cpu and manually load.  Overall worth it for the price and condition. Would buy from again.
1,It was excellent that what I wanted
-1,wont fit Y530q..eailer anwser is a
1,"Very easy to install, very under priced"
1,These cables work as advertised
-1,it didn't seem to work so we are not using it. ;-(
1,Just perfect!
1,"We have lots of devices charged via USB plugs. Keeping them powered is always a challenge. I wanted a portable battery pack like this one for a while and was interested to see how it would work. It is bulkier and a bit heavier than I thought it would be when I got it but looked of high quality. I fully charged it, noting that it showed green lights in sequence to how full it was charged. I was able to fully charge my iPhone 6 from 5% to 100% within a couple hours, and was able to do this 3 times per full charge of the External battery pack. That meets my needs well and I am pleased with this purchase.  I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review."
1,works.
1,Excellent quality came when it was supposed to!
-1,After a week of use it wont hold a charge and one of the earpieces pops off. Going in the trash as soon as I buy a replacement
1,Perfect for a p3 12
1,"I was hesitant to buy a new phone battery from Amazon after hearing how many people were disappointed with their purchases.  This thing works great so far, though - my old battery was dying halfway through the day with almost no usage, and now it's still at 40-60% at the end of the day.  I've had it for a week and so far so good.<br /><br />I have the S5 active, which I think it says not to use with this battery because the back cover doesn't seal as tightly as it should with this slightly thicker battery.  I couldn't notice a difference, it still seems to click into place all the way around, but I'm definitely not going to dunk it on purpose so I couldn't really say whether this compromises the waterproofing."
1,my son rocks with this case all the time
0,"not the same color as the one shown here.  Ours was more sea blue / blue teal.  Not a great picture, still in the packaging b/c we're sending it back."
-1,I got this so I can navigate or talk on the phone hands-free using the speaker mode. I didn't find myself using it as much as I had hoped to. I wasn't comfortable with my phone strapped to the steering wheel. It does block my view of my speedometer which I didn't like. I went with another phone holder that attaches to the vent which works so much better.
0,soso
-1,I have purchased and used 3 Blu phones.  They all run out of phone memory even thought there is ample extra microsd space available.  onc either runs out there is nothing you can do to fix this problem.  You have to factory reset it and lose all your stuff.  On a weekly basis.  DO NOT GET BLU phones .. they are not working !!!
1,Great case. Fits good and doesn't add too much bulk to the phone. Feels good in the hand and buttons are very responsive. No complaints about the case but where I've been sitting it down has wore some of the plastic to a white color but that's nothing major.
1,Perfect case!
-1,EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
1,"I love this case! It's pretty and it fits perfectly. I did separate the blue rubber piece from the hard plastc piece and put it on my phone first. Then I just clamped the hard plastic piece over the blue rubber one and voila! perfect fit. My only criticism is with myself for not reading the description thoroughly. I thought this was an all in one case, with a front cover. It's not. You'll need to have a screen protector, too. I despise those things, but this case is so pretty. I'll find someone who knows what they're doing (not me) to put the screen protector on for me."
1,Got it a few years ago and still holds at least three phone charges. Not sure how effective the solar panel is though.
1,"Fit was great in my BMW 328i center console.  I had tried other models which did not allow me to close the console, this fit and works great."
1,I love this case but the eyelet that the wrist strap hooks to is faulty. It easily comes loose which leads to the strap ripping the case.
1,"holds 3 cards max, comfortably two cards , have had it over 3 months so far and no issues of cards slipping, protects my phone and not slippery."
1,I love this case. It's secure and provides protection.. I dropped my phone plenty times and with this case it didn't crack or anything 😅
1,"Worth the price, fit my phone perfectly. Just what I wanted."
1,Excellent
1,Works well with both phones and tabs. i Charge it every week and use it 5 times with my S5
1,Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Nicely made.
1,Best case for note 4
1,Good product as advertised
1,"Work better than expected with my S4, Tab 10.1 & MXII, (google TV box)."
1,Thanks it is working great and charges fast and looks awesome
1,Nice fit and good feel. Along with a screen shield my phone is fully protected!
1,Good protection on this case. Love the color combo!
-1,"This holster comes in three pieces, however the outer protective shell that protects the face of the phone is very hard to slide on. You literally have to force it on."
0,"Great face plate & Cover fits good,"
-1,Not Good
1,I like it.
1,This cable is fantastic. It snaps into the phone nice and tight. I notice that this cable also charges my phone much quicker than the factory cable.
-1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
-1,Not practical! Not what i used to have from spigen! Easily scratchable!
1,So far so good!! I feel more comfortable knowing my phone is protected to a degree.
-1,Did not meet my expectations. Was expecting something totally different. Case already had several scratches when I received it.
1,The bass is almost non-existent but I bought it mainly for listening to audiobooks while mowing the lawn and it sounds okay for that.  Occasionally it will disconnect and then immediately reconnect which is incredibly annoying since this causes my audiobook to pause.  Hard to complain though at this price.<br /><br />Update: 09/06/2015<br />After posting the original review the customer service department contacted me and asked that I ship this unit back to them for a replacement.  They feel that this behavior indicates a defect and they want to make it right.  Score one for great customer service!
-1,the concept sounded good and i bought it based on the video review.  i have to say its not ideal for my car as i am constantly trying to adjust the tripod and vent.  i decided to buy another.  driving is more important than to be distracted with this.
1,"Wow. Best $15 I've ever spent. 6 hours of non stop calls and music. Bass level is awesome. Almost spent 80 on the LG set and glad I didn't. Only had them for two days but even if they stop working, which I doubt, i could buy 3 more pair and still be cheaper that the LG HV-800.<br /><br />To be fair I've compared these side by side with LG and only difference is call quality is slightly more clear with LG."
1,love it but it gets to hot......could you please fix this
-1,This cord is the worst I have ever gottenfrom Amazon it doesn't even work
1,Works great.
0,I THINK BLUETOOH. BUT IS OKEY
1,These were great and worked perfectly. Can't beat the price!
1,Worked great but you can't use your phone in hand while it's charging because it has to lay flat on the surface. Good for overnight charging.
1,good
1,"I think this mount is better than those that has a simple grip rather than a hook with spring. [[ASIN:B00VFEE86C Car Mount, AVANTEK Universal Cell Phone Air Vent Car Mount Holder Cradle for iPhone 6 / 6 Plus / 5S / 5C / 4S, Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge / S4 / S3 / Note 4, Google Nexus 5/4, LG G4, Nokia, Xperia, Moto, HTC and More]] --something like this, pay attention to the way it clips to the air vent. Talking about this mount, once you fit the hook into air vent it will never fall off. Also it has additional supporting stand so you can attach larger devices without worrying it would fail and break your air vent blind. The red rubber is efficient but I don't like the color; I would prefer a dark / black one since it draws less attention."
1,Great product for the money! I'd but it again

-1,"DO NOT BUY THIS. If you own a NORMAL S4 (which I and most people do) this will NOT FIT YOUR PHONE. It took longer than most things to arrive, and it has a gross plastic-y smell to it. AVOID THIS MANUFACTURER. This is the specific product I bought but I have copied this review onto the other kanji cases from the same manufacturer to spread awareness."
1,"Fit perfectly.  I like the rubberized feel of the case.  It is not slippery, this is what I was looking for in a case."
1,This is a good car charger help keep my power  battery charger full
0,"Previously had the Dual Layer Holster case but needed a replacement after the holster went MIA.<br /><br />Generally liked the Dual Layer case, a rubber cover on the phone, with a plastic frame that held the case to the phone. Liked the &#34;grippyness&#34; of the rubber, but it was a bit thick, the plastic frame had 'ribs' on the back that jutted out which made for an odd feel, and the kickstand held the phone up at an odd angle. Still, it was a very well made case, so returned to i-BLASON for the replacement.<br /><br />The Transformer case is strictly hard plastic. It's design is reminiscent of a case I had a couple of phones back, but this one is much thinner. It holds well and this kickstand can be used both in portrait and landscape mode with a more natural angle. Though the case does have a grip pattern in the plastic, it has a much slicker feel than the Dual Layer.<br /><br />Still, I remain impressed with i-BLASON cases for their solid and functional designs.<br /><br />Unfortunate UPDATE (10/08/15) - Spoke too soon. The hardshell design, slippery holster, and 180 degree pivot is a potential disaster. Cut across a park to get my kid's school for pick up. Holster must have pivoted 90 degrees right or left and the swing of my arm must have silently launched the phone into the soft grass. Thank you Lookout for letting me know that the phone was on the path of the walk, Found it about mid-way through the field, luckily face up so the sun reflected off the screen.<br /><br />Updated UPDATE (04/20/16): Not really i-BLASON's fault, needed to replace the holster after it snagged seat frame in car and snapped the belt clip off. This seems to be a design issue that has existed ever since cases switched from a simple clip to the rotating variety; there simply is no give. Hopefully, there can be an adaptation like eyeglass frames that now have an extended outward bend so no longer snap immediately if bent slightly backward."
1,Love it easy to use
1,100% recomendado
1,Product just as advertised. Great merchant
1,Good Charger
1,Good product fast shipping
1,Very good! I had one for a year and I just bought 2 more.
1,Works great but it's really really big. Bigger than other batteries with comparable power stats.
0,"Bought this for my husband for his birthday this year and it appears to work okay.  The arm is a little flimsy and does loosen up sometimes which then makes the phone spin sideways and not sit up straight.  However, it can be adjusted and it will work fine.  Seems like it holds his phone well and easy to view and get it off the mount when in use.  I don't think he has used the charger yet since we have one, but it is nice to have an additional charger handy when needed."
-1,"Awful!  Not really iPhone Apple product.  Cheap, light weight and barely work."
1,What you are looking for
1,"I use this everyday in my truck.  It's easy to set up and use.  I had to purchase a ground loop noise isolator to eliminate the buzzing now it's 100% perfect.  No distortion, no loss of sound quality.  It plays from the point it was at when you stopped it which is nice.  It automatically connects to your phone when you turn your car on.  All you have to do is press play.  The phone quality is good as well as the caller on the other end states that they have no problem with hearing me clearly and they do not complain of any loud background road noise.  Hope this helps.  I would definitely purchase another one of these if this one stops working for some reason.  I use it with my Galaxy S5 active by the way."
1,Absolutely amazing. I can charge my Samsung Galaxy S6 edge 10 times with this easy. I have also used it to charge my tablet (Nexus 9). It charges two devices at once easily. My fiancee and I use this when we are out and about during the day and have no access to charge.
1,Item as specified.
-1,It cracked not long after putting it on. I would not order it again.
1,"Elegant, sturdy, protective, perfect size and good materials"
1,"Easy to install, even for an older person.  Looks great"
-1,"Very disappointed, belt clip came off the first day, I was able to snap it back in place and then the pin came out of the clip the next day."
1,Amazing
1,Sturdy. Holding up well.
1,This is a great case! It doesn't add a lot of bulk and has room for a card and a little cash (I ditched the mirror). The only challenge is that it it slightly too big for the docking station I bought.
1,Great case but frame sort of narrows the screen width.
-1,"hardly to take off,don't buy it!"
1,It was what I expected it to be. Work fine
1,long and good quality， very nice cable！
1,"Delivered sooner than expected, easy to apply. Great screen."
0,"Worked OK for a while, and then started over heating.  After 6 months stopped holding a charge."
-1,"Tempered glass had a indent in it, causing bubble :("
1,Great!!!!
0,Okay
0,Good thank
-1,Very thin and flimsy case. Offers no protection. I ordered the mint green and received a dark blue case.
1,Good quality. I really like it!
1,"I have used this now the last couple months and it has done VERY well for me.  I typically get about 2 full charges from it for my Samsung Galaxy S4.  The charging time for the unit itself seems a little long, but is worth the trade off.  I have even had a few occasions to use the flashlight feature which is much more handy than expected."
-1,My granddaughter was excited to use th stylus' but highly disappointed when she found they had tears in end.  One was totally collapsed on end.  They are not useable.  Waste of money.
0,Product works but this is my 3rd one. Durability prevents me from ratng it any higher.
1,Super cute! A little big so it slides around a bit but not annoyingly so. Still love it!
1,Works well.
1,I purchased this selfie stick for a scavenger hunt we were doing where we had to submit pics of each task. It was such a great idea and the product is very well designed and constructed by the company. This particular stick was adjustable so it fit each one of our team members phones even though they were all different sizes and brands. It came in a box with simple instructions to put the 2-3 parts together and even had suggestions for use. We had a fun time and it even inspired our competitors to go and buy a cheapo one. We also got a chance to use it on the our cruise to Mexico. There are lots of products out there and I have had one from another company but this has been the best of it's kind and I would recommend it to anyone.
-1,Phone case created odd echoing noise. Used it or one week and the purchased a replacement from a brand I'm more familiar with.
1,"Netsun has a high quality cable that is hard to distinguish from the original Apple cable that came with my iPhone. While it doesn’t specifically state that it is “Apple MiFi Certified” like Belkin and other brands, I really cannot prove that it is not. The Netsun cable charges fine without any incompatibility messages and it syncs my iPhone just as fast as my Apple cable does. Both the USB and lightning connectors fit snug into their perspective ports, and the cable strains seem like they are durable and should last a long time. You cannot beat Netsun’s 100% Lifetime Satisfaction guarantee, a free replacement with no questions asked – sounds good to me, as long as I don’t have to pay to ship the original one back to China. Providing the cable passes authentication in iOS 9 which will be released in a few weeks, I would highly recommend purchasing Netsun’s cable.<br /><br />Netsun provided a free sample cable for this review."
1,love it really nice
1,My phone has a new life!
1,Works as advertised... Good grip in the cup holder and good grip on my phone...<br />I'd have given it 5 stars if it had a little more flexibility range...
1,There is a ton of capacity. Charges other devices fast. Takes a long time to get the device charged due to the high capacity.
-1,Very cheaply made. Lasted 2 weeks then started falling apart!
-1,An error order. So sad I can't send it back. Completely new in the box. Wish I can return it.
1,"Good quality, excellent for the job"
1,Great case!
1,Works fine
1,"I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. This case fit my galaxy s6 perfectly. I like the design and the ability to hold your credit cards, etc. Perfect and convenient.  Overall this is a good case for hiding your credit cards and not having to carry along your wallet. Perfect invention.  I recommend galaxy s6 users to buy this case. Loved this case!"
1,💯
0,"The iPod nano is pretty delicate so a case is almost a requirement. I'm somewhat conflicted on what rating to give. The case itself  is sturdy and feels solidly built but it doesn't hold the iPod very securely. You put the iPod in by sliding it to though the top but once in the case the iPod feels lose and can be easily pushed out the case (for example when plugging in headphones).<br /><br />I'm almost wondering if I got a defective model or if it's just the way it works , but there doesn't appear to be anything else wrong with it."
1,The screen protector works great.
1,Came apart after 2 months use but I was sent a replacement part with no hassles! Hope it stays together-- I don't want to lose my watch!! It is a nice looking band- I do like it a lot.
-1,Awful
-1,"The charging port works good, but my network internet 4Gs has no signal. That's right....Zero.<br />It is probably the wrong frequency for my Note 2 i317.<br />PS: I checked all connections including the antenna connection and they are good. The new port card does not work for network internet signal. The old port card network signal strength is great but no port connectivity."
1,satisfied
1,"Fit perfectly, feels good."
1,Beautifully engineered and does the job very well
1,"Works perfectly. It's been dunked in water, chewed on by a baby, and dropped on concrete just about every day. My phone is still in perfect shape. I will never buy another type of case!"
1,thanks
-1,After one month does not work
1,This &quot;Pocket charger&quot; is awesome it will charge my tablet fully in half the time it takes on the wall!
-1,"I've had this product almost three months, only one of my four chargers works. I'm very disappointed. I thought I would be getting a quality product that would last me at least a year. The chords themselves last a few weeks a piece and I had to rotate them out. I use them on both my iPhone 5 and my iPad. However, when hey did work, I was pleased."
1,"I can call anytime I want without using any sort of hand action. i can call whenever I'm in the gym and working out to say hi to my friends and plan a evening feast with them or anything I'd like. Love the part that it looks so badass and I cal always show it off. I did get it as a free sample tho, but the struggle was all worth it"
-1,Range is low. We went to a park with a lot of shrubs and trees on 3 bikes and I completely lost the other riders on the trail in less than a mile.
1,My daughter really liked her iPhone case!!!! Perfect fit!!!!
-1,The phone case came in bent on the side.<br />It never went back to the previous shape and it got dirty quickly.<br />I would not recommend this to anyone.
1,"Pros:<br />Vent clip is pretty strong, doesn't move at all once installed.<br />Choice of how to mount the magnet<br />Fully adjustable.<br />Cons:<br />Depending on you're case, you may have some trouble. I have an Otterbox on my HTC One, which has a plastic case over a silicon case. if I put the magnet on the inside next to the phone, there was too much distance between the 2 for it to hold firmly. However,m there was a small circular tab on the plastic part of the case. I trimmed it down, and the magnet fit fine.<br />The ball joint isn't really that strong. My phone kept moving turning while I was in a curve. This was solved by *really* cranking down on the locking collar, but I'm not a tiny guy; my wife would never be able to put enough force on it to hold it in place.<br />Finally, the biggest problem; the magnet strength. My car isn't the smoothest riding car on the road, bu even *slight* bumps would case the phone to move a little. After a while, the phone would either turn sideways/upside down, or just fall off. It was &#34;ok&#34; on the highway, but on ramps and smaller roads were almost unusable. To be fair, my phone's kind of heavy. With case, my phone is about 225-230 grams. My wife's Galaxy S6 stays fine (Same issue with the case, however), and it weighs about 180 grams. I'd estimate anything over 200 grams would be a problem.<br /><br />My seem like a pretty negative review, but if you're phone is light enough/case thin enough, and you can tighten the collar enough, I'm sure it would be just fine.<br /><br />*Side note* might be unrelated, but my phone acted weird with the magnet under the case. Screen would turn off if the phone moved while it was attached, the screen would bug out occasionally: it looked like the resolution dropped severely, and the colors change. Never did it before, and only did it once after I removed the magnet. Might be nothing, but bears mentioning."
1,I can't believe how great this works!
1,ENJOYING THIS
1,This is not compatible with the edge. I made that mistake. But the quality of the product was nice.
-1,"Well this item that I purchased is not what I expected it to be. This phone does not charge at all,none what so ever. Really disappointed. Need an address to return please"
0,Meh!
1,Great product
1,Great
1,Super good
1,This thing is amazing ! Covers my iPhone 6 plus easily but with out a case on my phone. Able to take pics and videos with this case on and hear my music perfectly when I bring it in the shower
-1,Cheap plastic & white everywhere except on the back  I thought it was going to be a black rubber cover for the price.  Highly disappointed.
1,Play Ball!!!! Pretty cool case!
1,This is such a great product and I am so glad that I got to try it.
0,Better than average

1,good quality for good price.
1,"It is very adorable, the only thing is, I have to be careful, or my phone will slip out."
-1,These headphones worked for a total of 3 minutes before they only had audio coming out of 1 side. Looked for a solution online but couldn't find anything
-1,"Very cheap, I ended up not evening using it."
1,"A little bulky, but good value."
-1,They do not work.... they suppose to be rapid but they are not
1,works perfect will charge or transfer data to an IPhone or IPad
1,pretty good case for a good price
1,It fits my phone perfectly. It protects it very well. I'm very happy with this purchase.
1,Niece loves it
-1,Burnt out too fast
1,Always need a spare charger just in case and glad I got it from here :-)
1,My wife likes this case.
1,"I feel a little safe, with is case"
1,Great speakers.
0,"I just got this case today and it is great looking but cheap feeling. I'm not sure what kind of protection it actually will provide but, if it breaks it will look good doing it."
1,Very good iPad protect and good price too.
1,Not a bad phone at all...
1,Great product
1,It is everything i expected :)
1,"Had it four months now, not a bad case for the money. Oil and dirt get ground into the back plate and make subtle but permanent stains. Case is durable, protects the NOTE 4 well. Holes, speakers, stylus, camera, and buttons all line up well. Fits the international version of the phone like a glove!"
1,Excellent charge cable nice and thick can't beat the price.
1,Fit phone great. Only complaint was the tab on the corner left a sticky residue that I am still working to remove.
0,"Broke after a year. The protection to the outer rim is near to nothing. My wife dropped the phone onto ground. The upper-right corner hit the ground first, there is literally no protection/cushion and the screen cracked.<br /><br />Cheap cover only provide the mere basic protection against daily worn. In case of dropping your phone, don't count on it."
1,Love em.... Will buy second one for back up....

-1,Broken before used.
-1,I bought this a few months back. This charger worked perfect for a few months. Then we go to unplug it from the wall and part of it broke off in the outlet.
1,My son appreciates the protection even though it took several tries to apply it properly.
1,Just as expected!
-1,"Worked for a few months, but now doesn't charge any Apple product that we have.  Product had potential but now is useless for lighting applications."
1,Great deal and fast shipping. Phone was indeed in near perfect condition as described. erything works great. Was able to easily use with straight talk service provider. Totally happy with this purchase. Would recommend seller highly!
0,Used this for about a week and it stopped working. I don't recommend this product  But the seller did contact me and offer a replacement or my money back which was great!
1,"Well built and clearly well tested.  It fits snugly, and while I'm not planning on testing this out, looks like it would provide good protection against accidental drops. Another plus is that the case doesn't add much bulk to the phone.  I've owned cases in the past for older phones that near doubled the thickness of the phone itself.  This is a nice slim form factor, which is nice considering how large the Nexus 6 is to start with."
0,It's good!!
1,Best armband I've owned!
-1,Don't be decieved. This case is definitely stylish looking but that's as far as it goes. The case itself is very flimsy and offers very little if any in the way of drop protection. Also there is no front lip to help protect the screen in case of a fall. Very disappointed I'm not sure why it got some good reviews.
-1,"Cheap, poorly designed, keeps falling apart, junk. Within the first 5 minutes of owning this thing, the phone fell out and hit the floor. The part that goes on the phone is rubberized plastic and fits poorly. I put the rubber cover on my phone from my former I-blastin case, that helped a little. The next issue was the pin in the hinge keeps falling out, I'll bet that I put that thing back in 6 times as the clip pops out and comes loose. I sure wish that I hadn't bought two of these things, they are junk.<br /><br />No offense to the seller, that all went perfectly, but I definately don't recommend this product."
1,Great option for a cheaper connector than the one directly from LifeProof. Haven't had any issues yet.
-1,When we received the product it was cracked and we had to send it back for a refund.  We then purchased a screen protector from Verizon!
0,"I rate this a 3 Stars since the price is quite high for a product of its kind and category.<br />Similar cover can be bought in stores like, TJ Maxx or Ross at about half the price."
1,Love this armband!!
1,Great product!
1,I ordered this for my Garmin Fenix 3 and it fits perfectly with zero issues!!!!  The order was processed right away and it arrived in Afghanistan within seven days of being purchased.  The application was simple and applied with zero complications.  Being deployed in a combat zone requires additional stress on your body and equipment.  My watch is subjected to continual abuse and this film is a life saver.  Thank you for the wonderful product and the fact it is made in the USA is an additional bonus.
1,"Easy installation, no bubbles after placing on the screen. This is not my first IntelliArmor screen, so I had experience installing the product on an IPad. The screen covers the glass, but there is about 1/32 of an inch all the way around the phone glass not covered. If you use a case, the sides of the case will cover the glass not protected by the screen. Overall the product and customer service will keep me coming back."
1,I use this stand daily
1,works great
1,I am really starting to like the Caseguru cases. This one is no different. This is a new way to add a credit card holder to a phone case and I like this format. The card is tucked in and protected and I think it is harder for people to realize there is a card in there which could be good. This is a nice protective case. The case also fits nice with the &#34;edge&#34; feature on my phone. Looking for a good fit on the edges is something I really watch for on cases now.<br /><br />Note: I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
1,"In full disclosure, this is a review for a free product received.<br /><br />It often takes some time to appreciate if a product delivers on its promise. What looks great when you first receive it has to find a place in your routine as well as prove to be reliable. In those two respects, the Anker Powerport truly shines. After using this now for almost a year, I haven't returned to my original Samsung mobile phone or tablet chargers again. It's become part of my everyday procedure.<br /><br />The Powerport is a workhorse that hasn't failed yet and charging seems fast. (Turning off power saving on the mobile phone or tablet seems to help charging speed.) It usually charges devices faster than I expected, for example from very late one night to very early the next morning. However, occasionally, for no obvious reason I can discern, it does seem to take somewhat longer than I predicted. I noticed this as well with my Samsung chargers, so this may be an indication of some unreliability in Samsung's measurement of battery levels.<br /><br />Charging both mobile phone and tablet together has not resulted in any increase in the charging time necessary for either. That makes it extremely practical, not to mention well poised for the future with five USB slots, with more and more products featuring USB charging."
1,Great screen protector but was confused about how to install.  Had to you tube an instructional video.  Otherwise it works perfect.
1,"I bought this in the end of July, and it was expected to be delivered by the end of August. I got it two weeks after buying it  and haven't stopped using it. It works with many different phones/iPods. I haven't found any problems with it. So happy with my purchase. (:"
-1,"I purchased 3 packs of 4 due to the high buyer ratings.  I have 3 iPhone 5 devices and an iPad mini 3 that use these.  We have many of these placed around the house, in cars or that I take with me when I travel.  They all work...sort of.  Our devices tell at times that the &#34;accessory may not be supported&#34;.  When this happens the device will not show as charging.  We sometimes have to unplug and replug the cord back into the device numerous times to finally get the device to accept the cord and charge.  GREAT PRICE, but I wish I didn't have to deal with the &#34;error&#34; messages."
1,Great bargain always need an extra battery for the phone charged up real fast
0,"The product is really cute and I like it, but I can't use because I can't find a bumber case that will fit around my phone and between the case correctly.<br />😕"
1,I love it
1,The packaging on this phone case was amazing.  The phone case is excellent smooth easy to grip fits the phone perfectly. All the holes are in the right spots nothing covers important spots that are vital to smartphone use. Have no fear if you order this it will be protected from the best packaging I've seen on a phone case delivered from amazon save the expensive otterboxes. This case is amazing and will protect from minor falls. Loving it so far. I received this item for free for a honest review.
1,"Good cheap phone, it is what it is."
-1,"Very low volume, ear pieces are tiny.  Whole headwrap is small, but so is my headsize - so hard to say. You get what you pay for - this is the cheapest bluetooth headset out there. It works, but it doesn't sound great."
1,The perfect tool for those who travel in remote regions and desire to have cell bar signals 24/7.
1,ive had this for a long time now and its such good quality :). i recomend
-1,Battery life is much less than expected.<br />Sounds great regardless of the kind of music<br />Effective @ blocking outside sounds
1,The stand is pretty sturdy and the watch and the charger fit well.  The phone stand on the bottom is only wide enough to hold the phone without a case so it would be nice if it were adjustable or at least a bit wider.  I don't have a large case but it still will not fit on the stand.
1,"I love the way that I can easily dial up a number and call without even using my hands. Device is very well designed and overall i'm pretty happy with it, if we also add the part that I got it for free so I could see if it was actually worth to buy. For me, it's a total must have"
1,"purchased for my husband, a general contractor, to use on the job site.  The product is perfect for his needs.....protecting his Ipad."
1,"Not sure if I wanted a wallet type case, but after using it, it is the right choice.  Good protection for phone, feels great in hand and looks great.<br />Still have to open it to receive a call, but then can close it and keep talking.  Also works well in car with voice recognition."
1,Great case for the price... I used it for about 6 months and have now purchased other designs... I like to accessorize and this was nice! CUTE and worked great for protection. I only changed because of style... I think this case would last more than a year.
1,works great!
