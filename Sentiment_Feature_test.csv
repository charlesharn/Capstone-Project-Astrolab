Beautiful!
"Enjoy using it, only think it doesn't seem to work on iPad with FaceTime. Works with movies and use<br />It outside to listen to radio station."
"love the fish eye lens, not so much the wide angle/focus lens. can't use the focus lens alone as it needs the wide angle lens attachment. feels like it is well made."
"Good item, Fast shipper"
I gave this to a friend for a gift and she absolutely loves it dresses her phone up nicely
"I purchased this Avantek CD Slot Car Mount Holder for my husband who drives a lot<br />for work & uses his phone for gps.<br />This is nice because he can do it hands free.<br />The magnet is bigger & much stronger then others he's had in the past.<br />Being able to tighten the flap to get a good secure hold in the cd slot is nice, especially with larger phones that have thick protective cases that make the phone heavier.<br />With the heavy duty magnet & secure slot mount you don't have to worry about the phone falling off while driving.<br />The only disadvantage with this is it does block the view of the clock & some of the buttons one the radio but that is still better then the others that connect to your air vent & block the flow, they don't hold as well as this one & living in Arizona in the summer you need all your vents.<br />So overall this is nice sturdy product.<br /><br />I received it at a discount in exchange for my fair and unbiased opinion."
for a fair review they gave me a discount. love it!
"I bought 2 of these (one for travel, one for my office) based on the reviews.  And I am VERY happy that I did.<br /><br />I have the stainless steel version of the watch, and the slightly higher &#34;lip&#34; on the front of this charging cradle keeps the watch from falling out of the stand due to the weight of the band.  Also FWIW the charging time seems slightly faster going from &#60; 10% to 100%.  But the difference is only a few seconds by stopwatch, so that may not be entirely accurate.  At any rate I would buy this charging cradle again, and I would recommend it to friends and family members."
Enjoying this case. Very pleased.
O.k. for the price. However it completely fell apart after six months of use. I'm not sure if its demise had something to do with the fact that my wife tends to stuff too many things into a wallet.
"So far, so good!  No issues whatsoever!  Best hub I've used, bar none!!  I've charged a variety of devices with the 6-Port charging hub using both the cables that came with each device and the Anker 5-Pack Micro USB Cables (3ft x 3 + 6ft + 1ft).  The devices are:<br /><br />2 - Samsung Galaxy S4's<br />Amazon Kindle HDX 7<br />Amazon HD 7<br />Jabra Solemate<br />Jabra Extreme 2 (Bluetooth Headset)<br />Samsung Galaxy Tab 10<br />Nook Color<br /><br />Will certainly order another hub for use elsewhere."
Fast delivery and looks great!
Nicely built and very slim
"ok headphones....I went cordless because Im a welder and often Im alone for long periods of time welding for hours. I got regular head phones but they seemed to always break at the 3.5 jack that connects to the phone. With these so far so good, Im on vacation so I cant really say they are good or not yet but I will update when i return to work."
Good product
Very good quality
beautiful! fits great! shows snot when sneezed on.
"Excellent product, beside of the small size, I specially like the versatility of the dual function as transmiter and receiver which work perfect! I definitelly recommend it."
"Power wise, its great. Construction is lacking in some ways. After months of rigorous use swapping between 2 of these and an OEM original, the bottom black plastic edge cracked off 3/4 of the way. It still works but be careful or you may have problems with the contacts not touching because of a now slightly shorter battery"
"Had the fitbit, but hated that it miscalculated steps on multiple occasions, particularly when I'm running errands with my kids (didn't compute the steps taken pushing a grocery cart or stroller...some days this is a lot of steps for me). So with months of researching, I gave the Vivoactive a try. Best decision I ever made!! Love the everyday look of this, but the functionality is even better. Enjoy the smartwatch capability to tell me text notifications, especially when I'm with my kids (to know if it's an important message or not). I used this watch to help me train for a half marathon this summer and it did wonderfully, even when I did cross training (pool workouts, bike workouts). Only qualm I have is that sometimes I use an indoor bike trainer for workouts (with two small children it can be challenging to get outdoors on the bike...), I find it annoying that I'd have to pay another $30 or so for the Garmin indoor bike trainer computer. Can't be perfect at everything I guess. It seems like Garmin is doing a great job of updates/improvements to their software too in the few months that I've had it now. Also I really like Garmin's Connect App. Keep up the good work!"
"Biggest POS I have ever bought in my life!  Waited too long to install so couldn't return it.  Remote doesn't work, eject button broke on first day and DVD player skips on every bump.  Sent it back to Pyle (AKA pile!) After paying 50 dollars in shipping got in back and had all the same issues within a week.  Time for a sledge hammer and a $250 loss!"
I purchased this case for my husband who works in steel and metal manufacturing due to his previous phone case not being able to keep his phone protected from the harsh environment it had to endure on a daily basis. This case protected his phone from paint and metal debris and being dropped on concrete numerous times. I can't say enough good things about the LifeProof brand. I would definitely purchase another Lifeproof case if he buys a new phone.
It was exactly what I expected it to be love love love it.
"Screen still shattered with this case on, save your money"
"This is a complete waste. I am the worst of the purchase list. The worst finish of the goods, quality is also not good.  you can see circle of the screen and bond between screen."
It is already cannot charge. Not good
For some reason it keeps getting moisture inside the tube. I work inside a constant 70 - 72 degree building / jail. I then have to take it off for the rest of the day till I get compressed air and blow it out.
This fits my Droid razr maxx hd like a glove. Thanks..
I've purchased many items through Amazon and have never left reviews. This will be my first review in over 5 years because they are so good. I bought them to wear with my phone so I don't have a cord jammed between my fingers.  I compared the prices of other Web sites and went to best buy and these were the cheapest. I was expecting much less than what I received.  Well made with lots of ear fittings.<br />I've used some beats before and these are right up there with the sound quality. Expecially if your watching movies. I use them all the time and am extremely satisfied.
Great buy
"Great case. Orange is a little brighter than pictured but that's fine with me; it's my favorite color. And I love the kickstand! The stylus is handy and the perfect size. The screen protector was a little tedious just to prevent a few finger prints. And no matter what I did I couldn't get the air bubbles out from underneath, so that ended up in the trash. But overall - for the price - great product bundle."
Ok
These are AMAZING. First off they use a micro USB as a charger so I can charge them on the way to the gym with my car charger that I use for my phone. They also charge really quickly and will last 8 hours. I even like the voice because it let's me know when they are actually totally off. LOVE THEM. GREAT VALUE!
Great!
Looks great on the phone and was a good price. Seems fairly protective. However I do believe that it adds a bit too much weight and bulk to the phone. I'm considering looking for another product.
"The case itself cracked very quickly, and popped off my phone, and the rubber part around the camera lens hole popped off too. It's okay, but wouldn't get it again. I switched it out maybe 6 months after buying this."
Very high configuration for the price. Nice to have this phone
These fit as expected. Poof! I have my headphones back!
"Looks Great, fits right, works fine"
"Great product. I love that there is no adhesive. This means I can remove the protector, clean, then re-apply. No screen diffusion at all. The only con I could possibly have would be that it doesn't protect the entire screen (leaves the edges). Other than that, great product.  Side Note: Crazy fast shipping. Like literally ordered it Sat @ 4. Received Sunday @ 12. Crazy fast!! Thanks"
Strong and looks good
No problems so far.
"This is super handy. Works well and keeps out phone right in place. Be careful with the manner though, it put a pretty heavy scratch on the back of my iPhone."
Simply the best!
Perfect case for my new phone
This Selfie Stick is both well designed and well built. The overall device is smaller and more compact than I expected which is a good thing. Therefore taking it places will not require a second thought.
Nice product!
Just what I wanted when I Needed it
"Junk, the back door holding the cards breaks after 3 months of use.  I have one that broke and I purchased one for my wife that also broke.  Stay away until they make the door hinges stronger."
"Excellent battery. Definitely purchase a 2 amp wall charger to juice this thing up quickly. The piano finish gets a lot of flack but I prefer it over the new PowerCore's matte finish. The PowerCore will slide right out of your hand, whereas the E5's finish is grippy. An added benefit to this over the PowerCore 15,600 is that this one is shorter lengthwise but has a slightly higher capacity. I can deal with 3 amp output vs 4.8 amps for the PowerCore."
"I will admit that I am a Spigen fan. They make the thinnest profile cases for all things Apple. Before i received this case i carried my phone naked but the camera protruding on the back made me rethink that. Enter the Spigen Thin Fit case. The cutouts line up perfectly and the case covers the sides, back and extends just a bit onto the corners. The sides of this case comes right up to the edge of where the body and the screen meet. This allowed me to use a screensaver that covers the complete screen including the curves. Minimal increase in size and works very well. Great case."
Very comfortable and convenient.
This is a fine product. Well engineered and constructed of what appears to be quality leather. It is excellent protection for the phone while providing a useful grip that is attractive and feels good in the hand. I tired of the bulky units furnished by some of the companies. This gives the same level of protection without the bulkiness. The cover alleviates my concerns about &#34;butt dials&#34; while carrying the phone at the gym or other places. I would buy it again and will certainly consider it for gifting.
"Perfect for what I needed. The back under the clip isn't protected and gets wet from sweat, but no phone issues because if it."
Fits snug! I really like the look and feel of this case. Light weight. Delivered way ahead of delivery date.
"Have bought other packs of cables for cheap prices like this, even braided ones, but they all crap out and transfer quality sucks. These cables are totally fine, good quality, works well.  Have yet to have any of them stop working or anything."
This is not a tempered glass screen protector. Seller should stop passing it off as tempered glass it's a cheap plastic at best I'll be sending this back. Buy else where.
This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it!
"ok, but not great.  Doesn't last very long."
It protects your phone great but the case gets dirty after like a week or two
"Grips my phone well and unlike some other mounts, allows me to change the angle easily. Because it sticks out a bit from the CD slot, it does bounce and flex a bit over rougher roads, but it's still usable."
"[[VIDEOID:2341f14120dc21efbefe97676ba89d64]] Watch video here in HD on YouTube: http://youtu.be/7mK6GAnr80Q<br /><br />A great case to keep your iPhone 5s looking sexy and minimalistic. I usually have my phone naked except when I travel, I usually have a Mophie battery case when I do. This simulates a naked like feel when handling it however during my review I did find something that did not suit well. Here are my thoughts;<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Ultra thin case<br />-Comes with a stylist<br />-Comes with a screen protector (basic level)<br />-Very durable<br />-Flexible<br /> -Transparent however multiple colors are available<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Cutouts are not precise, at least on the review unit I received<br />-Volume buttons are hard to press<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Overall this case is not bad, I really love how thin and durable it is. Just because I had issues with the volume buttons this lost a star. I also really like how it came with a screen protector and a stylist, especially considering how affordable this case is.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am a professional product reviewer and was provided this unit in exchange for my honest opinion."
"Easy to replace, worked perfectly."
It does not work well.... I can leave the phone on it all night and by morning its only charged to 85-90%.<br /><br />Plugging the phone in fully charges it in 2 hrs tops
"Great case that looks good and great protection. With a couple flaws.<br /><br />1) The rubber part that goes on first is to soft and moves around, also creates a pocket grabber trying to take in and out of your pocket.<br /><br />2) The power button is hard to push. It's too flush abs you really need to push hard to use it.<br /><br />3) This isn't really a flaw but a notice to others. The orange color is close but not like the pic. It's more of a yellowish orange. Which isn't bad but I was expecting the orange in the pic. Again this isn't a flaw just a heads up for others.<br /><br />I would've given it 3 stars because of the flaws but considering this is only 7.99 with prime shipping I gave it 4 stars. Hard to beat it for the price and this level of protection.<br /> I would have preferred the hard plastic or a stiffer rubber around the top and bottom to keep it from grabbing my pocket.<br /><br />Oh and as far as size goes I would consider it close to a otter box defender. But looks way better imo."
"Got it to replace a oumax watch that failed, I have grown to really like this watch. Took a few days, but now very happy with the purchase."
"The charger arrived on time, but didn't work that well. The bit that goes into the phone was loose and I had to balance it very carefully to get my phone to charge at all. I only kept the charger for a couple of days before I got too frustrated and had to replace it."
Good product<br />Easy to put on my phone<br />Keeps all functionality of my phone
Worked for two weeks and now doesn't charge at all. I had one exactly like this and it lasted for almost a year.
Good product!
"It is of high quality but it suffers from the same issue as all the other Note 5 tempered glass screen protectors I have tried so far: halo effect. The edges all along the screen protector do not adhere to the display and are lifted, creating a bubble, or &#34;halo&#34;, effect."
Very happy with our portable power pack.  My husband has a classic car which he drives to different car shows so the power pack comes in handy when traveling.  I like that it lets us know when it is running low on charge also.
gooooood
"I bought these as a  backup for my LG Tone set.  They actually sound pretty good and are pretty comfortable.  They pair and connect quickly.  However, sometimes I like to leave one ear out so that I can hear what's going on around me (when on a call or listening to podcasts), and they will pull on your ear.  This is one of the downsides of these types of bluetooth headsets with just a cable connecting the two earpieces."
Great product.
"Great phone cover, I just wish the orange was a little brighter and less coral. This is my 2nd cover for my 2nd phone. I would buy it again!"
"love it.  clear, easy to use and long talk time!"
"Was initially taken back by the design.  It was a bit bigger than I anticipated.  After putting it together and using for the first time, I fell in love with it.  Securely holds the watch and iPhone in place."
Perfect fit for my iPhone 4...totally fixed my power connection and detection (when the software disable the speakers because it falsely detects being docked).
Love it like I'm dying
as expected
clear pic quality but you can't see the screen if you turn it to the angle to see the road (unless you mount it on the left side of the window).  you have to remove the memory storage because it won't loop the video
"I installed this in the clear &#34;box&#34; that the charging back for my Samsung came in. It works really great. The only minor issues I have are that the clear box allows the LED to be a bit too bright for right beside the bed, and the clear plastic that I used doesn't have any way to align the phone with the charger. That's a design flaw on my part, but it works well enough that I haven't felt a huge rush to fix either issue."
"It looks very nice, protects mobile when falling. One single drawback is that these drawings of butterflies start to disappear a little at a time."
Got these about a month ago and now none of them work. Not worth the money.
I like the look and feel of the case. The only reason for the two star rating was the camera flash halo. Once you place the phone in the frame there is a distance between the frame and the case. This small space creates a shadow (halo) when using the flash for pictures. It renders this case useless when taking flash pictures. I ended up having to cut a small piece of the case off so the halo could be eliminated. I only did so because I do like the case. I'd save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere for a case.
"works great , and price was a great deal"
My stepson needed a covering to protect his mp3 player and he found this. It works great and priced good.
I live this tempered glass. Totally have my phone from damage!  Love it
Great phone case.
Works well.very satisfied
"Love this USB charging unit, its small and allows me to charge my 700 different types of rechargeables. Works great."
Awesome price and quality
"Solid, simple to opperate & reliable do far"
Good price & performs as stated. Using one right now on my iPad mini.
I love my little cardbuddy. It's easy to apply and very convenient. All my friends want one now too. I just wish it was black to match my case but other than that I'm very satisfied with it.
The phone does not recognise the sim card.
"Jenna here- I purchased this tempered glass screen protector after my previous one chipped after 6 months. I'd changed my phone from it's everyday protective case to a fashion (plastic, clear) case for a wedding party and, naturally, dropped it within minutes, chipping the corner. Quality tempered glass protectors will fracture in large breaks, containing the impact and damage- which is what you are looking for when shopping the many brands and makes online.<br /><br />This was my third brand I've tried- installation was standard but not the smoothest experience. I'd say this protector is about 2/3 thickness of my previous IntelliGlass protector. It also seemed to be a little off in the button port placement, as I feel the centered placement (on the button) is just off to the left, as minimal as it is to notice this threw me off and I had to re-seat it twice before final sealing.<br /><br />My protector was dirty/smudgy with a lot of marks when I peeled off the protective sheet and I had to use the included cloth to remove these marks before applying. I had no issues with bubbles or pockets and it sealed, fairly quick, on it's own with just a tab of pressure in the center.<br /><br />Since this tempered glass protector is a little thinner than previous one's I've owned it actually seems to work better with my SPECK case, and even better with my waterproof (Lifeproof) case, which is a benefit.<br /><br />This kit includes everything you need- alcohol wipe, dust sticker sheet, microfiber cleaning cloth and instructions- as well as 1 screen protector. Some other brands include 2 per package, which is nice- but I anticipate this will last just as long, if not longer than my previous one, so I don't mind.<br /><br />If you're new to tempered glass screen protectors, there is a touch feel and responsiveness that is unmatched in comparison to other screen protection methods- I just love it. Everyone who handles my phone asks why my picture looks so clear in low and high lighting, or why it just plain 'feels' so good to use. Most smartphones have gorilla glass equivalent screens- your phone is intended to be used with a glass responsive experience, if you don't have a glass protector you're missing out in my opinion!<br /><br />We were given a product discount in hopes we'd share our honest thoughts and experiences, which we have done.e.

"Nice. Would recommend getting a case or cover to go over the backing. The backing it comes with is not very durable. Even if you drop it on carpet or something soft, it will automatically come off and battery will fly out as well."
First time arrived broken so I requested a replacement which arrived cracked as well. I don't believe thIs product can protect my screen.
Works but is the fake no nfc pad like the Google cardboard he probably go the pictures of Google images
This product was horrible it stopped working in 5 days after I recieved it
The product was not too bad but considering it was the wrong one for my phone so there
Cables are pretty thick. Bigger than Apple sync cables. So far strong and durable quality. Got a 3 pack for a great price.
" It's not every day that you find a portable charger that is able to charge from solar energy, but is also shock and water resistant so that you can leave it virtually anywhere to charge and it'll still be pretty safe."
"I wish I had bought this sooner.  The Anker Charging Station has done an excellent job of reducing the clutter on my night stand. I currently have it charging an IPad 2, Kindle Fire, IPhone 6, IPhone 5, and an external battery.<br /><br />The included 40 watt - 5 port charger matches the charging station and does an excellent job.  This is my second Anker charger and I am very happy with the quality of these devices.<br /><br />So far I have only 2 complaints:<br />1. The slot furthest to the front is wider than the two behind it.  I wish this was reversed as it would be easier to charge the iPad in a thick case and be able to access smaller devices if it was located in the back.<br /><br />2. I wish that they offered this in black."
"So far, so good.  When I go on daily bike rides, I make sure I keep this in the car in case I need to recharge any of my phones or accessories while I am away from a power source.  I can charge items a few times before this battery pack needs a recharge.  Time will tell in regards to durability but so far, it is working nicely.  I am actually using it a lot more than I thought I would."
"I don't have an iPhone so I didn't know if it would work or not. I bought for my sister who was visiting and forgot her iPhone charger. It worked just great. Now that she is home, she is happy to have a spare."
Good product slightly cheap looking but sturdy and well designed.
Works good.
5 stars if thinner
The plastic casing is brittle a breaks easily. I was only able to use me case for two weeks before it was so cracked and broken it wouldn't hold my phone any longer.
Love It got 2 of them and going to get 4 more for son and grand kids.
Very goo charger and works as promised charging quicker than other products I've tried.  Highly recommend.
"The SoundBot SB735 is a really nice headset. Firstly, in the box you get the headset, then you get a black box which contains a USB a user manual and lastly smaller ear tips. Now the headphones themselves feel very high quality. You have the back, forward, and pause and play on one side. Then on the other you have the volume up, down, and the button to pick up calls. Other then that there is a flap on the left side which has a usb port you can use to charge the device. The ear pieces are magnetic so if you hold them by the end of the body they automatically go in their holder. These magnets are pretty strong and don’t let the earpiece hang loose unless you want them to. They fit nicely into your ears and there are different eartips provided to fit your ear. These are very comfortable as you don’t even feel like they are on. You can even lay down with these and you won’t feel as though they are there. These are very easy to connect to your device as you turn them on then you turn on the bluetooth on your device and then click on the name of the headset and your done. As for range these are great you can be around 25 to 30 feet away from your device and these will work great. The microphone on these is really good and produces crystal clear audio. You can clearly hear the person and there is no audible static in the audio. As for what you hear these are great the sound is really good and clear. You will have no problem hearing the person when using these. If you want to use these for music they are good too. I would place them right above your average headphone, like something that you might get with your phone. These have great bass, so if you are someone who listens to bass heavy music these are great. As for battery life these last a long time you get around 10 hours of battery life if you use them non-stop, but if you use them lightly you can last a couple of days. For a price of just under $20 these a great buy and they sound amazing."
Great quality. Fast shipping. Very convenient product.
Looks great and phone is well-protected; meets all expectations.
Very satisfied. Shipped in timely fashion.
It made a world of difference
Not satisfied with the charge time it's better then some but what was expected but the looks are great looks nice and great size
"This tracker is very stylish, I would wear it as an accessory even if it had no function.  But the UP app is also the best app for regular people (read: Not hardcore fitness addicts) It analyses your habits and coaches you do make incremental improvements in your overall health. Yes, the number of steps you take in a day is important, as is working out.  But more and more research shows that lack of sleep can negate many health benefits gained from exercise. What about diet? Up gives all of your meals a food score which is color coded, so you can easily understand the quality of food you are consuming at a glace. While the baked-in food logging is pretty awkward to use, it pairs with myfitnesspal which has the largest database of foods of any app.<br /><br />Overall, the app is a lifestyle and health coach, while its competitors are just fitness trackers.This is a major difference.<br /><br />I love almost everything about this product.  Cons are the food logging  portion of the app, the clasp has come loose a couple times- If you have the band snug (doesn't need to be tight or pinching) on your wrist it will never come off.  But it can get looser with use or activity. Also, the paint on the band gets nicked, which takes away from the classiness of the band.<br /><br />As far as the tapping goes, it just takes some getting used to.  Still not super reliable (sometimes a takes a few tries to get it).  Don't worry about it. By the time you read this it will soon or may already be a thing of the past.  Jawbone has announced that in the next firmware update, they will do away with manual tapping for sleep mode.  Instead, it will now auto-detect sleep (like it's competitors).  I don't know what happens if I want to take a nap."
It really works under water
"Love this product!! Not only will it protect your whole screen from cracking, but it somehow keeps the screen less oily.  I love the feel of it when I'm typing and  makes it easier for me."
"I haven't used this device very long but it is charging an IPad ,a Blackberry and 2 Android phones at the same time. Before it was a pain fitting all of these items on a power strip all together. It appears well made and the USB ports are nice and tight fitting."
They didn't even last a month and the wire braid around the iPhone plug broke down and then they stopped working. That happened on two tog the three cables j purchased. So it's been about a month and now I only have one working cable left.
"Not worth the price.  It works,  but its just not worth the price"
"Incredibly cute Totoro case, his face here cracks me up! This held together fairly well in the 6 month time-frame I used it for, the picture didn't get scratched off or anything. Decent price as well."
Just what I needed and fast delivery
"Feeling stupid.  Reading the description and doesn't state these are sold in pairs.  It states &#34;speaker harness&#34;, which I took as one.  So, I definitely have extra now..  Great product overall!!"
Hate it!
I love the idea of the case but mine and my husbands broke within a week the plastic by the power button cracked and now the door wont stay closed
The colors are very dull.  Fit the phone as expected.  Disappointed in the appearance.
Great phone
"I purchased 3 packs of 4 due to the high buyer ratings.  I have 3 iPhone 5 devices and an iPad mini 3 that use these.  We have many of these placed around the house, in cars or that I take with me when I travel.  They all work...sort of.  Our devices tell at times that the &#34;accessory may not be supported&#34;.  When this happens the device will not show as charging.  We sometimes have to unplug and replug the cord back into the device numerous times to finally get the device to accept the cord and charge.  GREAT PRICE, but I wish I didn't have to deal with the &#34;error&#34; messages."
"Product did do it's job, it protected my screen, I yogurt for sure it'd last more thanone"
"In terms of price vs. functionality, this is the best smart-watch currently available.  There are simply no two ways about it.  It has many features; but the most important is robust voice-command functionality.  It is also stylish; people often ask me, &#34;is that an Apple Watch?&#34;  I tell them, &#34;no; it's about a quarter of the price.&#34;  This is especially satisfying if the asker is wearing an Apple watch.<br /><br />The point of a smart-watch, as far as I can tell, is to keep you from having to pull your phone out of your pocket.  This watch accomplishes that purpose, with aplomb.  The watch includes a built-in speaker, so that you can take calls on it.  You talk, and it talks back to you.  You don't think you will ever need or use this feature... until you need it.  I swore I would never take a call on my watch; but sometimes, you find that it's just convenient.<br /><br />The built-in speaker dovetails nicely with the watch's most important feature: voice control.  When paired with my LG G2, running the latest version of Android, I can use its voice command feature to initiate Google Now.  It works, even if the phone is locked, in my pocket.  This means that I can send text messages, check the weather, look up and call phone numbers, convert weights and measures on the fly, and more, without ever having to touch my phone in my pocket.  This, in my opinion, is the best feature of this, or any, smart-watch.  I've taken to text messaging my wife during the day, while I'm working, just because this watch makes it easy; certainly easier than picking up my phone to fiddle with a touch keyboard.  It goes like this:<br /><br />Me: &#34;Text message to Scout Finch mobile: 'hi, honey; just checking in to say I love you.' &#34;<br /><br />Sykla M1: &#34;Here is your text message to Scout Finch: 'Hi, honey, just checking in to say &#34;I love you.&#34; ' Do you want to send it?&#34;<br /><br />Me:  &#34;Yes.&#34;<br /><br />Sykla M1: &#34;Sending message.&#34;<br/><br />The heart-rate function works; something I cannot say for, e.g., Zeaplus's DM360.  Alarm, pedometer, SMS, also work.  You have seven [stylish!] watch faces to choose from; you can even set up a different face for each day of the week.  Switching them on the fly is easy; most days, I just pick one based on my mood.<br /><br />Let's talk about the hardware  The build of the watch is solid.  It's constructed of metal, and hard plastic; the band is an attractive leather.  It is not flimsy; I have banged it, scraped it, and abused it in any number of ways, without impacting functionality.  The watch is truly waterproof; you will have a devil of a time using the touchscreen if there are a few beads of water on it; but, you can submerge it, and keep it under, and it does just fine.  I would say that it takes a licking and keeps on ticking, but strictly speaking, it does not tick.<br /><br />The hardware for this watch is manufactured by MIMI Sangfeida, in China; but, rather than buying direct, I recommend this version, which is rebranded by &#34;Rezilient Company LLC&#34; in Georgia.  The watches faces available with the M1, seven in total, are much more stylish than the ones that come with the Chinese version.  I typically advise buying goods direct from China, rather than on Amazon, to save money; but, in this case, it make sense, because the Sykla's better watch-faces add value, without adding much to the price.<br /><br />Nitpicky issues: you have to be in pedometer mode, for the pedometer to work; otherwise, your steps will not be recorded.  Long SMS messages don't always come through; you will see a truncated version on the watch.<br /><br />The cheapest Android Wear smartwatch right now is the LG G Watch; which, if you are a savvy shopper, can be found for around the same price as this watch.  But, it doesn't have a built-in speaker.  This one does; and, because it works with Google Now, it basically includes all the features of an Android Wear device.  Buyit.  Love it.  Gloat about how much less you paid.  If you want to drop more coin on an Android Wear watch later, more power to you.  But, this one does everything you need it to do."
Works as promised great product.
"Perfect fit for my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Note 4. It's lightweight and not at all bulky but very durable,strong and snug on my phone.  I've dropped my phone a few times and is been perfectly protected by this. Highly recommend!"
"Honestly I was not expecting much from this product. I bought a four pack thinking we would use it for our kids book bags etc.<br /><br />I now have a tile on my keys, work ID, wallet, and computer bag. Probably the best purchase I have made in 5 years.<br /><br />The tile themselves are a little thicker than I imagined, but I got over that quickly. My wallet is the only item, for which it really makes a difference."
"Best headphones. It has 3 buttons that let you switch between calls and music with one touch at ease, and controls the music as well. I don't need to touch my phone when I am running outdoor work. I got it as free though. I am having nice experience with it."
"I put this in my wife's car as a replacement for another kicker combo set-up. Could not find the same woofer must be out of production, now I see why! This is brand new and still being made, excellent dual sub-woofer. Makes my wife's system really kickher..."
"I like the fact that it give you privacy and it's easy to put on. I did have to cut a small piece where the light blanks on my phone In order to see it better ( galaxy s5) but other than that, I enjoy my screen."
nice product
Excellent holster for the iPhone 5. Very secure hook and loop closure.
"The clear Ringke Fusion case is stylish and functional. Raised edges keep the back and front of the phone from coming into contact with flat surfaces, and buttons remain easy to press. I especially enjoy the headphone port cover, as it gives the case a more finished feel. One minor compliant is that the TPU sides of my case have started to yellow, most likely due to UV exposure. Additionally, the thin strip of TPU above the micro-usb port cover is fragile, though it has not broken on my specific case.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good value case, this is the one!"
Does not work with my IPad!
The instructions are vague and there is no diagram naminng the various buttons purpose. I still am not sure how to switch between AM and PM.
This is fantastic.  Tunes in the shower are the best.
"It was comfortable to wear, but one of the tabs that secure the phone broke off after three days."
Nice will work just fine!
Came as expected and in a timely manner
Wasn't expecting much from this cheap amp but it hits pretty hard!  Right now I'm just using it to drive one 8&#34; Kicker sub and it more than does the job.  In case no one else has mentioned it here - in order for the little remote to work you have to use this amp on the low-pass setting.  Cheers.
I have always loved these Incipio cases because I feel they give the most protection to the phone! This case seems to wear down very quickly and I end up buying a new one every other month because of how beat up they end up looking; But I would rather pay for a new case than a new phone
"Great case, great looking, feels like the otter box but with less bulk. Finger print feature still works great with it on.One big downfall is they completely forgot to make an opening for the stylus and its alot of effort  to take off to use my stylus.  UPDATE  MINE WAS DEFECTIVE  It looks like they did not cut plastic all the way for my stylus opening but i plan on rectify that with a razor blade."
"Fully functioning, kick butt sound. at a great price"
"Looks great, works great, fits great, plus a great price."
Very unhappy with purchase. Case did not even fit my phone (galaxys5 ). Buttons didn't even line up and case look like it fit and iphone.  All info said this what i ordered . Had to go to Verizion  store and purchase a case for a much higher price . I will put that one in the junk box and chalk it up as lesson learned . Sorry VERY UNHAPPY !!!
It's only I don't like the sound not loud
OK
It came broken was very upset
Very disappointed.  Much too small for the Galaxy Note 4 screen. Previous screen cover fit much better.
"Got this case for my hubby's ZTE Speed phone by Boostmobile and he loves the rugged look n its easy to hold, not slick like some cases. This has rubber grips , plus a stand for using on desktop."
"Wow! That little thing is full of useful features, easy to set up, sounds great with an amazing rich deep base. A delight to listen to and operate. You can't go wrong with this. I use it on the bathroom sink and am confident it will survive a splash of water now and again!"
"I've bought and used this car mount for my iPhone 6 recently. This is not a paid, free sample or sponsored product review. Here is my product review on this item:<br /><br />Packaging - Small, sturdy and packaged nicely. Items were wrapped nicely inside and came with two small cards with product and company information.<br /><br />Setup - Setting up the car mount is fairly easy. There are two main parts: the head (where the phone is held), and the body (where the mount stands/sticks to a surface). Connecting these two parts were fairly easy but did have some slight trouble when connecting them at first. Just make sure you hear the &#34;Click!&#34; sound when connecting the two pieces for connection confirmation.<br /><br />Usage - When using the car mount, the look, feel, and maneuverability of the car mount is great. Screen is completely visible, no blocks and can be corrected into the position you feel most comfortable. Landscape or portrait the phone when placed on the car mount is good. Sturdy, does not shake or wobble.<br /><br />Dis-assembly - After using the item and putting it away is also easy. Just undo the click for the two main pieces and voila! your done.<br /><br />Setbacks - I've only encountered two setbacks when using this product. 1) This product price will fluctuate. I bought mine for $10.99, week and a half later it was at $5.99. Could not get the difference because thanks to Amazon's pricing policy after 7 days you can not get the differentiated price difference. My loss.<br /><br />2) When using the car mount, the phone has a bottom bar where it &#34;sits&#34; comfortably, this bar unfortunately is opened in the middle for charging on the go, but blocks the headphone jack. So if you're in need of using the headphone jack while in the car for calls, or the AUX cable then it becomes tricky. Luckily I found a makeshift solution to the problem. You connect whatever you want into your headphone jack and THEN you place it on the car mount. Thanks tothe claws of the car mount on the side, it still stays in place with minimal to no movement.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy about this car mount. Would recommend to a friend. Any questions or comments feel free to post below."
"Best phone case/card holder on the planet. This is my second one and when I get the next generation phone, I'll get another, easy to use and offers great protection."
It is working good
Did not sync with my phone and have had no luck with it working
This was my first lifeproof and I'll just say I was beyond excited when it was first purchased. To say that this case didn't live up to my expectations would be a huge understatement. I bought the case from Amazon and within the first month or two the mute (sound) button had torn significantly lowering the value of the case and stripping it of it's waterproof seal. I spoke with LifeProof's customer service and was sent a new phone case fairly quickly (which surprised and delighted me). Unfortunately about a month or two after receiving the replacement case it also began to breakdown (althought not as badly in the same spot) but also along the door for the charging cable (it has a hole also). These cases definitely were not worth their price and also not what I expected from a company that I heard so much positive praise about. I can't say that I'd buy again.
The stand is pretty sturdy and the watch and the charger fit well.  The phone stand on the bottom is only wide enough to hold the phone without a case so it would be nice if it were adjustable or at least a bit wider.  I don't have a large case but it still will not fit on the stand.
It doesn't work
Perfect
Works exactly as expected
love it but it gets to hot......could you please fix this
Fast charger.  2 ports 4.8 amps. I would recommend this. Good price. I use this often. I like and use this a lot for my ipad 3
Accurate description. Fits loosely. Wouldn't buy it again.
It's great love it!!!!
works great!
Is good but it will peel screen protector when clip to the holster.
good
terrible phone it came from china it's a copy from the galaxy I'm really  upset to buy this product
"I have used this numerous times and it works great, fits well and stays in place."
I like it a lot. It's sturdy and holds cards as well as my phone.
heavy duty wire. works well so far
The case was bigger than the phone .. It did not fit at all. Money wasted .
"When I first got this in the mail I was very happy with it. I order 4 more. But after using each one for a couple of months I found the became loose and difficult to use. One by one I had to give up on each one. I had to by a moe expensive charger, but it is still working..."
it didn't fit the Tab 3 7&#34;<br />that I got
"Bubbles. I followed the directions exactly. When it said to remove the yellow sheet the entire protector came off, even after squeegeeing. So this static electric pulled in dust when reapplied. The bubbles never went away either like the directions said. It was also very Smeary from fingerprints, not like the glass screen. I returned for another product, glass this time."
still have not got it to working just right but Hunter enjoys it.
"The camera is not working.  After installation, you can only see lines as picture attached. No option to contact seller after purchase.  Edited: Camera worked after connecting the power to the head unit.  Tail lights don't provide the full 12 volts and the camera needs 12 volts to work properly."
"Case looks good and provides good protection, and the stand feature works well. It could be improved by adding a hole or slot to the front flap so that the camera would work even with the front cover folded around the back. One weakness of this design is that it does not allow for car dash mounting. I found a workaround, but incorporating some means of doing this would be a great improvement as well. My case was shipped to the wrong location (an error on the part of USPS, apparently), but one irate phone call to Amazon customer service later, the error was rectified, and I got the case, albeit a couple of days late."
good product
"I bought 3 of these in July and let them sit in the packaging until August 31.  When I went to charge them, only one of the three charged.  I will not make this mistake again."
"I purchased one of these along with an Anker 10000MH battery pack specifically for a trip off the grid in a tipi.  I smoke an ecig with lots of batteries that needed charging.  I've also got an obvious cell phone.  The solar panel is great.  It opens up to catch as much sun as possible.  Even in the shade (which I was most of the time) it was still able to charge a battery and cell.  My car charging ports were all taken by my gf's stuff so I had to rely on my charger.  I used the solar charger in the back of my car while driving to place to place in full sun.  Even if it wasn't getting full sun in the back of my car, it would still charge.  The Anker 10000 MH battery pack takes about 16 hours to charge from dead to full plugged into an outlet.  I wasn't able to ever get it fully charged with only 4-6 hours of off/on sunlight but it worked.  Again, the tipi we stayed in was surrounded by trees.  We were in complete shade, yet it still charged for the most part.  It is rugged, although the grommets could have been placed in a slightly different arrangement to allow a user to hang it a bit better.  The little pouch kinda gets in the way...or if it was flipped 180 degrees, you would hang it while holding your stuff.  Overall, I was very pleased.  Went all weekend at a place with no electricity yet still used my cell phone and ecig anytime I needed.  Great product."
Screw broke off into my radio the first time I put it on and then I had to send it out for repairs. Pass on this one.
is awesome
"This screen protector is very durable and easy to hold while placing on the screen. It is the exact size of the Samsung Note 5 screen from left/right edges so it takes a little long to fit it so it is covering the screen perfectly. This is a good thing because it gives room for your phone case. If there are any bubbles they are quickly removed when you use the provided cloth to smooth it out. Also, any particles that stick to the screen can be removed with the dust remover strips. If you take your time and make sure fans are not on, then installation won't be too hard. The screen may be thick but it does not take away from the quality of the screen. The stylis works just fine. It's not as smooth as it is on the phone's screen but there is no lag or issues while writing on the screen. All this said, I would recomend this product."
Works like a charm
Not willing to test the bulletproof feature. Lol!! Awesome screen protector. You get instructions on applying this to your phone. Not sure on taking this off. Scratch resistant and good fitting. Allows for using phone cases.
it was great shipped in a fast time frame. Thanks
Nice product
It's great once you learn how to use it.
Got 2 in today. Very Please so far. The Magnets may very well be stronger than the Pebble Cable. Charged my watch no problems
"Junk. Threw it out within a day, never stayed put."
worked just as described and no issues with cord not supporting the device
"Stylish, elegant and looks expensive. It's fancy looking without being gaudy and it doesn't attract dirt, which is nice. I do wish there was just a bit more coverage on the top corners - if you push them back slightly the corner will pop right out. The slight contours fit nicely in your hand which really makes you want to hold the phone a lot. The contour is barely noticeable. I dont know why people say it does not sit flat on it's back because mine does. Looks beautiful with my gold iphone 6. Also I haven't had any trouble getting any cords into the jacks which I did with my lifeproof - even aftermarket charging cables with the larger heads fit fine."
Great
Great stylus. It writes really smoothly. My boyfriend and I have been using it for months and it has been holding up really well. I prefer it way more than using my finger.
"I must have gotten a bad one, it doesn't do a very effective job of charging my iPhone 6 plus.  Charge for it about 30 in the charge and the battery only increased for 10%. The two USB port worked better from Acepower worked better."
I love this case and best my phone stays in place when I'm driving and its soft plus it came early
The case is perfect I got it for myself but my daughter has the same phone so she claimed it for herself
Was as posted
"LOVE IT, VERY BRITE PURPLE COLOR. FITS GREAT AND MAKES IT EASY TO HOLD ON TO YOUR PHONE."
great price for 5 working cables!
Stopped working after second use.
This is not a great quality case. Looks really  cheap. .I guess you get what you pay for. Disappointed
As promised
I love it I just wish there was a opening so I can charge my phone with it close
excellent quality products
"Amazing, started a diesel lawnmower with a dead battery that would not charge"
Just as described
Works well
Love it!
Great great Great great Great great
Definitely does NOT fit the ballistic nylon phone... Cannot even use the side buttons because they do not line up properly. Wish it actually fit my phone though. Depressing and false advertising. Will change rating when I hear why you lied and said it actually fits my phone. -Droid Turbo Ballistic Nylon
Excellent product and value!
Fuctional perfection.
I have these and the 4.0 version and I have to say I like these so much more.  I like the stiff band around the neck much better than the lose one (the lose one used to get stuck when I turned my head).  These are very comfortable and I hardly feel them at all while running.  They are easy to pair and easy to turn on/off.  The battery lasts a long time (but I haven't clocked it).  I have used them for phone calls as well and the sound is great as is noise cancellation.  The only complaint I might have about this is the location of the multi-function button is right over top of the volume button.  When you grab to adjust volume your tendency is to squeeze so I have accidentally dropped calls trying to adjust volume.  This is just a learning issue for me though and will be fine once I adjust.<br />These headphones are a great buy!
"I like this case, with exception of white chips/marks showing up on my blue case. It also shows wear compared to my wife's Caseology. I recommend getting light colors to avoid this issue."
Bought this in advance of a trip to Europe to charge multiple devices with one charger versus carrying multiple chargers.<br />Didn't work. Now I'm back and I can't return.<br />Don't waste your money on this.
Great
Works great!!
nice!
excellent!!!
I give it a one star because the screen couldn't even survive shipping...it was broken already.  by the time I got it
A good quality as a $35 glass screen protector I purchases at Verizon.
rear facing camera will not work I have had 2 replacements and the camera works for a while then it stops
Very cool and good case!
Prone to failure.
great
The nylon cable helps with that nasty problem of breakage and it's a great color! I received a discount on my order for a fair review.
High quality cable at an incredible price! Plastic is solid on connectors and the shielding is thick. This looks like it will last. I will update if anything happens to this cable.
"Not really one to write a review but I am one to read a review. Being that this is a great product I had to go on record and let everyone know. I've had  many headphones on my ears or in my ears so my 5 star rating is for sound quality,engineering and definitely price."
Works perfect and for a great price too.
"The Apple Ipad Mini case, I received was perfect for my usage, which is to make handling of the very slippery Ipad easier. I use my Ipad exclusively as a monitor for my DJI Phantom drone and the fact the the cover is transparent and offers good tactile grip makes it ideal for my use."
The only downside to this cable is the end that goes into the phone has a larger cover than the official Apple branded cable. It still works great though.
"Sounds decent, battery is not the best, but it lasts a good few hours of talk time."
"Never worked with any device, maybe I just got a dud"
Not the best quality as most of these are.
Is very good
Doesn't work with vents that the guides move vertically up and down. Holds your device securely though. Just really disappointed with the vent mounting.
Reliable
These are great for the budget price. I use them all the time for runs and they have been great!
Worked well
Very pleased with purchase. Sturdy and perfect fit.  Attractive and nicely made.
I wanted an extra cord and charger for my phone. This product fits the bill.
Yes it is a great case
GOOD CONDITION
Great case! I get many compliments!!
"Pretty satisfied. Dented the thing with a couple of drops--one between the slats of picnic table right onto concrete (about 28 inches drop, I'd guess). No damage to the phone, so the case did its job as expected. The bulk added is noticeable over the naked phone, but still less bulky than many cases on the market it seems, and the level of protection so far is excellent.<br /><br />The only little quibble: The speaker grill has a thin piece separating two openings to the speaker. This sticks out, and therefore has worn off, revealing a silver/white color underneath. Not sure why they added the ridge, maybe to allow sound out when the phone sits flat? It seems like this same wear will eventually happen to the whole case, but replacing it (maybe refreshing in a new color?) down the line is better than replacing or repairing the phone, obviously"
"expectations was too high, and was let down"
The strapping broke after limited use. Junky.
"It was a bad experience , the videos do not work."
Fits great. Very durable
Excellent Thank You..
"Very pleased and would reccomend, but dots fade somewhat over time. Many other of my bands have broken, but this one has held up. There was a slight misprint where the dots were printed on the side window area, but are barely noticeable."
woks just like advertised we like it
"I like that there are two options to secure the armband since I'm slim and was worry it wouldn't fit my smaller arm. But it did. The touch screen still works under the plastic cover. :) The slot for the earphone was open and easy to locate. It was also easy to insert your phone inside and pull the cover tab over to protect it. There's even a little slot to place one key inside. Only thing is that I did feel a little sweaty underneath it, even thought it was suppose to be sweat-resistant. But overall very good product. The armband did what it was suppose to do and stayed in place while I run at the gym.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest review."
Item as specified.
i like it!!
I use this to charge two of my 6 plus and one of my gopro at the same time. very nice and compact.
excellent
"great  case, cute an safe. good price"
"The suction did not stay attached to my dash board, so the unit was always falling down, especially when my phone was in the holder."
I love this case and now have it in 2 colors.  It is the perfect size for the Samsung Galaxy S5.  The case provides excellent protection and has held up extremely well after a full year of use.  I have dropped my phone numerous times and it has stood the test of time. I highly recommend this product!
"Great device; just beware of the restarting problems that i'm having. Cant run too man programs at one time, but what do you really expect."
Bluetooth does not always connect automatically when I get in the car and I have to tinker with it for awhile to get it too work.
Just as I expected. Terrific phone. I'm sold on HTC phones.
love these things
I got this in mail on time as expected delivery date. The speaker work well the down fall is it do not come with an charger.
Well made sturdy protective and attractive case.  Its a great buy!
"Awesome phone case, doesn't make the phone look big, the design is great and the buttons are great to the touch."
thanks
"It's a great investment but, they should have 2 cloths since there is 2 screens in the package."
Works great!  Use on in my truck for the kids to connect there gadgets and it has been working well.
"Using the Tough Claw together with a ball Diamond base, Garmin Nuvi Cradle, and double arm socket to mount GPS in a RZR UTV side by side.  System is very solid and offers a great range of adjustability.  Can mount to roll bar or on the passenger &#34;T&#34; bar and adjust so driver or passenger can see and operate the GPS."
Really good quality glass came very quickly highly recommended
I love my Up Move.<br />I decided to purchase this after receiving a little push from my best friend who purchased a different Jawbone product.<br />I was initially sold on buying another well known brand however after reviewing the differences in features I went along with her and purchased this Jawbone.<br />There are several things that I love about this little gadget.<br />First the size. Its super small and works great being clipped onto your clothing.<br />Im a nursing mom so I initially would clip it to my bra however that became more of a chore so I decided to use the wristband which I plan to review also. I love the option of being able to use it either way however the Jawbone bands design is horrible.<br />So back to this little gadget.<br />I also love the fact that it is wireless. That was a plus for me. My friend has a different model jawbone that has to be plugged into her phone however mine connects via bluetooth and that takes the work out of having to remember to upload data each day.<br />I also love that I receive daily reports regarding my activity and I'm able to track what i'm doing constantly and also compare it to what my friend is doing. We use that for a little weekly friendly competition.<br />Overall I've been very happy with my Up Move.<br />My only complaint is the battery life which seems to be pretty short.<br />I wish the batter lasted just a tad bit longer<br />My other complaint is regarding the strap that is made for the up move  ( purchased separately)<br />The strap does not stay on. The design is one big flaw and causes the band to constantly come off.<br />Other than that this is a great gadget to help you to stay on top of getting those steps in daily!!
It's a piece of trash!!! Battery lasted for about 2 weeks and then never worked again!! And the thing to put it on the wall never last... It falls every time
Very cute.
"I grabbed this speaker so that I would be able to take to the beach with me and use my MP3 player while sitting in the sand. For its purpose the speaker worked great. It is very clear, easy to use and holds a charge long enough to enjoy it for a few hours.If you need a good little speaker to take with you on the go I recommend grabbing this little guy! This product was given to me at a discount in exchange for an honest and accurate review.<br /><br />-H"
"I received a product discount for a fair review.  Good product, very sturdy and well made"
works great
Works great and was easy to install
Slow charge.
Nice case
Pricey but worked fine on recent trip to China.
Very nice upper mount for my tripod. Expanding clasp holds my iPhone 6 tightly. I highly recommend this.
Great product
Like this so much I got one for my wife and brother too!
Fast delivery everything as promised.
Like this case!
"Nice, love big cord. But ring around phone-end connector came out of cord housing within a week. It still works, but difficult to disconnect."
"Although this case looked pretty sleek and enhanced the grip, it offered no form of protection for the phone. I had the case for about 2 weeks before I dropped my phone on my hard wood floor only to pick it up and see a crack, not only through the exterior plastic on top of the screen, but also the screen itself...indicating that the case offered real shock absorbing properties. I would NOT recommend buying this case, as it does not withstand the test of a 3 foot drop."
"Great sound, good battery life.  You need a FM station with no signal but if you do definitely pick up!"
"I have been using this for about a month with no problems.  Installation was easy as this is a slightly thicker protector than flimsy plastic ones, so it had some mechanical strength for easier application. The surface does get dirty, as I would expect, but it is easy to clean.  Finally, I have had no issues with screen sensitivity with the protector in place.  Everything works fine."
"[[VIDEOID:62e5762bb8e193596a116b24f7622a79]] We are always skeptical when we review these types of headphones, but we were impressed with this set for the comfort and sound quality.  as we show in the video, the packaging comes with the headphones, a micro USB cable to charge them and a few sized ear pieces.  Definitely try the different sizes and find the best one for you.  This will make a different in comfort, staying in the ear, sound quality and background noise blocking.<br /><br />The diagram left a little to be desired on locating the charging port and we had a good laugh finding it.  I show in the video exactly where it is and how to get to it.  We knew it was there but did not feel the little catch at first.  Charging did not take long and we get hours of streaming play from it.  Using it for calls decreased the battery life some.<br /><br />The audible and tiny LED light let you know the status of the headphones at any time.  It tells you when it powers on and off to make things easier.  Pairing was quite simple as well.<br /><br />So the bad thing.  The microphone is located in the tiny control bar and we tend tower that part behind our ears so while we could hear them well the other side didn't always get a crystal clear sound from us. There was some background noise.  It tried to pick only my voice up but there was some definite background and the location makes that tough for the headphones to do.  See the video for what we mean and a demo.<br /><br />Comfort for long periods of time was not a problem and we enjoyed the sound quality.  These are not supposed to be music perfection in sound, but the snug fit while we ran was just as important as having decent sound quality.  There headphones did both.<br /><br />See the video for unpacking, setup and more."
love this! works great
Worked once and not too well.  Then nothing. Total waste of money
have preferred these 2x already will be ordering more great quality for the price
Love the stylus and the fact that tips are replaceable.  So glad I came across this product and highly recommend it.
"I absolutely LOVE this wireless charging pad.  I purchased this for my S6 Edge and there is nothing bad I can say about it.  When I first got my S6 Edge and realized its wireless charging capabilities I purchased this charger and Samsung's wireless charger to try both out.  This charger has actually been more reliable than Samsung's charger.  It is much lighter, smaller, and slimmer than Samsung's and that is a great bonus for travel.  I really like the charging port on this because it is easily accessible and my cable fits snug in the port without coming free.  I can't say the same for Samsung's.  Overall I would highly recommend this charging port and intend on purchasing more in the future to have in multiple places!"
Very good product.
Doesn't fit the turbo phone at all
I love it !
Love it
"I am a little worried when there has few reviews , also this is a new item so i am worry about the quality . I am suprised about the polished black adapter face . I LIKE it so much ,then I try to install the clasp to my apple watch band which is back , so i choose the black one . fit well to my watch band . and easy to use with the accesory of tool .<br /><br />NOW i have used for a month , it is still looks good ,and the seller email me ,let me write a review ,I am a fresh man to amazon , but the seller is very patient to tell me how to write ,nice ."
Great
Piece of crap.  Just for decoration.
Exactly what I was looking for. Extra protection for an iPhone and cannot even see that it's in place. Highly recommended for protection and to keep fingerprint marks down. A huge step up from the plastic film protectors.
Nice and easy to fit.
"Just what I wanted, it fit my 6 inch Garmin perfectly."
"So I bought theses covers right after I bought my Note 5, which these say they are for. No matter how you try to put these on, it does not cover the whole screen. For 6 bucks, I really wasn't gonna complain, but if they claim to do something they don't, then why advertise that. Other than that the cover is okay. It would have definitely been a 4 or 5 star, but because the whole screen isn't covered, I deduced some. Granted it is only a super small sliver of screen left..."
Fast shipping/good product
It working good thank you very much
Thanks as described
Does what it is supposed to do.
"Product was so close to being perfect, but like others have mentioned, after 1 week, the band starts to peel away at the location it meets the watch and looks very cheap.<br /><br />I ended up going out and buying the Apple version of the identical band and it hasn't done the same issue after 2 weeks, and also has a 1 year warranty.  So close, yet lacking in perfect development and testing."
not happy at all with OEM I had to get one of my batterys replaced because one of them never worked when I received it then they sent me 2 more battery's and again one of them did not work I will not buy another battery from OEM again
"Wanted to buy the Bose wireless but was put off by the negative reviews.  For $300, they should be perfect.  Settled on this model for about $60, thinking it was a low risk gamble... boy!  Am I GLAD I DID!  Have worn them for a week solid during 4 hour commuting each day.  Great sound, comfortable for long term wearing, and a great price point for a wireless headphone that doubles for phone calls and music equally well on my Android device.  Definitely a recommendation to buy for anyone looking for clear, crisp sound quality and a comfortable fit over the ear."
Provides decent protection while keeping the phone slim.
I had one before and got a new one one week after i got it the end broke half way off on the bottom were the legs slide in
Good product. Fits very well and easy to switch with original band. It can get scratched pretty easy though but that's common with wear. Somehow I believed this item would come with tools to do swap out old band with this one but it didn't. That was my only disappointment.
Zero stars why pay $100 for a case that does not protect you device like life proof claims. Bought the case for my 12 yr son iPhone 5s the first time it got knocked into the pool for about 30 seconds the phone was a total loss. Same as if I had not spent $100 on a case. The case leaked in two places top right corner between rubber and screen protector and around charging port cover. Of course life proof stood behind their warranty they offered me a new case for my destroyed iPhone that their product did not protect as claimed. So now I'm out the cost of an iPhone and the cost of a case that DID NOT perform to lifeproof claim.
much thinner than i expected but still appears to be good protection for my phone.
"I have to say I am a bit impressed at the solid construction of this aluminum stand. It has a sturdy feel to it. It is adjustable for angle, making it easily viewable on my desk whether I place it on the low portion of the desk, or up higher near my monitor. The adjustment button is solid and holds well so it will not fall. The rubber feet give it good traction. It is painted with an &#34;Apple like&#34; color and texture so while it does not match my IMac perfectly, it is close enough where it does not look out of place next to my monitor.<br /><br />The only negative is that I cannot charge my IPhone 6Plus or IPad while it is sitting upright on this stand. I can turn the device sideways while it charges. If there was room to have the cable attached while sitting upright this stand would be perfect for me. Yes, that is a minor issue, but this is a review so I am just stating my thoughts. Overall this is a great product.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes."
Love the unit
dont get it
"Self-destructed very quickly, not worth the effort to return."
"ship fast, good product and original"
I actually ended up inserting it upside down in my CD player so it wouldn't interfere with other button functionality and it works great. I really like this.
D.O.A ! enough said returned.
Sound quality not as stated.  Great outward design but functional quality needs improvement.
"[[ASIN:B00U0JVW7G SaharaCase iPhone 6 Case - Rugged Protection, Thin and Lightweight, Includes Tempered Glass Screen Protector, Professional Camera Hood, Stunning Colors Including Black and Gray Sahara Case]]I  the case is one that wont slip out of your hand and it protect good too.also have to say that the temper glass that you sent with that is probably one of the best ones that I have had for not leaving fingerprints very bad and it wipes off very easy"
When you have kids that play with your phone you never know what can happen to your cell phone. I have no idea what happen or how it happen but when I went to take a picture or my kids I notice something on the picture so I clean my camera lens. I took another picture but the lines where still in every picture. I thought that I was going to have to replace my phone. But then I saw the back camera lens and purchased it. It's was very easy to switch the lens on the camera. Now I can take pictures of my kids with no lines on them. I received this item at a discount price in exchange for a honest review.
Cheryl
This is an awesome phone case. Very sturdy and well made.
"This feels really good in my ears. it does not hurt, it does not fall of, it's just the perfect size. Would be glad to recommend and I have to say that this seller made this comfort possible for me just by giving this headset to me for free, just so I could honestly review it later"
"This is nice, however, didn't fit everything and didn't organize it as well I was hoping. It's a well made product, and very reasonably priced. I was looking for a travel case that could organize all of my electronics, chargers, ear phones, etc. This fits my chargers and ear phones, but not all of the devices. I used to carry everything is Crown Royal bags, which I decided is not extremely professional at work, so this definitely a step up!"
My friend loves his new phone thank you
Great price and shipped early. The only problem I've encountered is the wire casing came out from under the phone charging end cap. Still works great so I'm not complaining.
"The case functionality is great!  fit perfectly, protect iPhone, magnet works great.  White case looked very nice when it's new,  however, when it got dirty, it was impossible to take the dirt or any marks off of the case. I used all kinds of different chemicals, none worked.  Since I loved the functionality, I decided to purchase the same case with darker color."
"The case itself does not fit the phone, thus disabling the use of the silent switch on the top left edge of the phone. The finishing around the edges of the aluminum face is of poor quality and the case itself looked used. On the packaging it states that it comes with a leather lanyard and that it is made in the U.S.A., but the lanyard was neither leather nor was the product made in the U.S.A. After further research the product was produced in the China. Overall, poor quality and false advisement."
A simple cable to add flashdrive support to an older 1st gen Xbox. It plugs into a controller port. Worked just fine. I ordered from STA Online and it was shipped from China. Arrived in just 1-1/2 weeks. Very satisfied.
Charges battery really fast and easy to carry
"Bad stuff , they send me a broken one ...I threw it away ..."
"My spouse has one of these and really likes it, so I thought I'd try it.  It has a good grip and I don't have to use a case to carry my phone in."
"I have found nothing bad to say about this protector. It's fit my phone, was easy to apply, and a week later I'm still happy with my buy. It's worth the few bucks"
Ridiculously high quality. Very strong/secure. Have been using this with my Olympus TG-4 camera.
Very helpful on a very long road trip!  Didn't have to worry about suction cups losing their grip and flying off the dash or window! Use it everyday!
Kids loved it!  Great product!
Love the case and color!
It's the first case to prevent my teenager from breaking her phone.  And she hasn't gone a year without breaking one prior to this case.
"Clever product, uses stiction and air pressure to attach the glass plate. My only quibble is with the instructions - if you only use one of the hinges to secure the plate for flipping back onto the phone face you will almost assuredly have a misaligned protector (as I do). This is only a cosmetic issue, but it's irritating. Use of two of the hinges supplied with the protector will produce a much better result."
Great quality and protection for the price
"Probably like you, I had never even heard of cubot, but I am now a fan.  PERFORMANCE: Scores about 27500 in the &#34;antutu smartphone benchmark&#34; app (galixy S4 and 'htc one' are at about 26000, galixy S5 is abt 33000)... So it's performance is excellent for the price. I am a multi-tasking fool, and it hasn't let me down yet.  CAMERA: takes excellent pictures and video... It has a Sony cmos camera, works pretty good in low light considering it is a phone. Front cam is better than most. Quality skype calls, outdoor photos, indoor selfies.... it does it all well.  STORAGE: Storage is 16gb (but with micro SD card slot). I found conflicting specs on different sites, some say 32 gb micro sd, a few say 64 gb max... I am using a 64gb, and while my phone work likes the card, I couldn't get it to show quite right using 'mass storage mode' on my pc using the included USB cable. So using the drop down menu on my phone I select &#34;mtp mode&#34; for usb connection, and my pc sees my 64gb card no problem. I have loaded gbs of music to it and it works.  SCREEN: Very vivid color and easy to read, looks high resolution, good side angle viewing too. Screen size is BIG, which I like; if you don't it might not be the phone for you.   IR RADIO: This is a little uncommon, it has an infra red transmitter to be used with the 'ZaZaRemote' app, allowing you to control DVD and blueray players, TVs, AC units, radios, ect... The app has a database of hundreds of common brands and models, with an option to hold your remote up to your phone so it can 'learn' the device. I had limited succes with older DVD, VCR, and entertainment changers, with newer devices it worked pretty good... Except that my vizio's channel and volume contols would trade places in the app.. But yes, on/off control, input change, volume, it works.  SPEAKER: sucks, its quiteish, I like listening to music/audio books/speakerphone calls and its not nearly as loud as say, my iPhone 4s. In cubot's defence, it is a pretty slim phone, not much room for a large speaker  CARRIER: Unlocked is awesome, I ran it for my last week with att's gophone plan, and I just changed to puretalkusa (they lease from att so identical coverage, but more competively priced plans) works on either, or T-Mobile I am told, among many others. It doesn't support LTE (or 4G) to my knowledge, but I'm ok with the 3G internet service in my area. Note: I did have to reconfigure the APN phone data settings for puretalkusa to use Internet on their network, I just googled their settings and typed it into the phone settings, pretty easy.  BATTERY: Not the most impressive, it will last me all day with no problems, but its not amazing. Comparable with other large-screen smartphones.  WATERPROOF: It is IP65 rated, meaning at the time of manufacture it can be held in any direction under a sink for 15 min with no damage... This does not mean that it is necessarily submersible or that you could take it swimming. There are several reviewers on YouTube that show the phone running apps and videos under 5 inches of water... Well, proceed at your own risk. I live in the Pacific Northwest and regularly have to deal with loads of rain, so its basically rainproof :)  INTHEBOX: Comes with a softcase (nice because there isnt a big selection, I found one hardcase online and its still in the mail), and a USB cord ( which had its wires exposed at one end from the white cable sheath, not good, but it works), and a tool to pop open sim and micro sd trays.  OTHER NOTES headphone jack comes out the side, not top or bottom... Weird.. Timezone resets to east coast if on autoset... Might be my carrier? I just set it to 'manual set', no problem. Light on the back is bright, makes a fantastic flashlight, I appreciate the data usage tools so I know what I've got left and that I can set a limit so I can't go over."
"Best one,  put on dash smooth area grips nice and easy release easy tabs, easy to place so it grips.<br />You will have to put in upside down and turn unit if you want to charge it holder covers plug in for S5 phone."
Very nice looking watch
"Eventually, I found something working well in my car!  Now I don't have to hold my iphone all the time!  Great!  I would definitely recommend this to my friends!"
Great product.
"Excellent item, great service"
Clip was very loose on the phone
Item as described!
"This case is awesome! Very easy to put on the phone, and I feel that it is much better then the last case! Love it!"
At first I was quite pleased with the product.  It fit well and provided easy access.  My joy lasted a whole two weeks and then the phone retaining latch broke off.  Fortunately I had my hand near my iPhone and caught it on the way down.
This is exactly what I needed.  Works just as described.
"Affordable, and protects enough. Pair this with a decent screen protector and you have a hard to kill phone."
Definitely one of the best cases I've used. It fits very snug around the phone and protects it very well. Would recommend
Good price bad quality
I was a great case.
It says it charges windows 1020 it don't says it charges iPhone 4s it don't says it charges samsung s5 it don't ...so I tried a older phone I had I don't use cause the screen is cracked it's a Nokia 900 hey that worked completely useless to me it charges none of the 4 phones in the house ...
The case is very durable and the colors are beautiful.
"The cord included originally did not work. It did work with my own cord, but I emailed the company and they responded the same day and sent out a new cord. Now I can use the battery and it is awesome! So useful."
"[[ASIN:B013I3MGH0 Etekcity 2pcs Auto-Smart 360° Universal Car Mount Holder - Windshield Cradle for Smartphone iPhone 6/Plus/5/4S/4 Samsung Galaxy S6/S6 Edge/S5/S4/S3 Note 4/3 HTC One Google Nexus 5/4 LG G3]]<br />Impressed by the oversized suction cup footprint which makes a solid bond on slick surfaces without water. Once fastened, the mount is unmovable. There are two adjustments made with locking nuts that secures the phone solidly into viewing position. The best feature of the mount is a quick release or quick secure ratchet mechanism that locks the phone itself into the cradle and with the press of a side button, easily releases the phone for storage. Very clever and thoughtful from a user's point of view.<br />The side clips and bed are rubber padded so as to not scratch one's phone. However, the pad on the bed itself does not cover the entire surface. In the interest of economy, they've attached a large circular rubber pad that provides adequate protection for the back of the phone.<br />Overall, the cradle is solidly made within the confines of all-plastic construction. Hopefully the ratchet mechanism is substantial enough to last through hundreds of cycles of attachment and removal. Too early to tell.<br />Two units for the advertised price seems pretty reasonable.<br />Disclaimer: I have purchased a camping stove from this company and was so impressed with the quality, I became a user/reviewer. I received one cradle unit gratis in exchange for an honest review. I would recommend this unit to friends and family without qualification."
Quality product!
This was everything I was hoping for. Reviews of various products were kind of iffy and I was worried that this might be a dud...but it turned out to be a winner. I have no hesitation in recommending it.
It's great but it blocks out your voice fir people to hear. That's the only downside
Still working great
Works and fit well.
"I used this for awhile, but within a month the band broke. The company did send me a new one when I complained, but after that I just wasn't into it anymore. It didn't feel very accurate and because the first band broke so quickly, I just wasn't into going through that again. I ended up getting a real sports watch with a real heart monitor and ramped up my workouts that way. I'd go with a fitbit or something more substantial if I decided to go this route again."
"bad product without completely disposable manufacturers warranty and never respond, I do not recommend this brand much less sellers."
AS advertised
The fit is perfect. Completely satisfied.
Simple and can't beat its price. Been using it for two weeks and no complaints.
grandson loved it
"Great, loved it. Perfect for my car."
Great part and easy to install
fits better than the original one that came with my watch
I have them paired with a little Kenwood KAC-M1824BT amp. I have them installed in my Polaris Ranger in the ceiling. The bass is not the best but sound amazing in every way. I will be buying more of these for my boats. I would put these up against any speaker of any maker of any size at any price point. I will personally guarantee that if you install these with a modest amp you will be thrilled! If you don't like them message me through amazon and I will buy them.
Phone is great. I mainly use for texting and keeping me organized and it has a very nice camera built inn. Battery life is the only issue it doesn't last very long.
Started out working fine. Charged phone and iPad. Then iPad stopped charging and two nights ago phone said it was not compatible. Now i have three cords that work on nothing. I got about a months use out of them. On the bright side they were cheap and fast delivery!
"I must own more than 5 different iPhone cases for my iPhone 6+ but the is my preferred one now.  It offers good protection, good hand feel and the card slot works well because there is a mechanism to prevent cards from dropping out."
"Great case! I thought it was not going to last through the many times I drop my phone, but it gives me great protection and it took several months of drops before I even managed to nick the case. Looks great! The gold is the same tone of gold as the gold iPhone so they look nice paired together. Very lightweight and smooth, but offers a great deal of protection!"
Case is great. However the plastic protective shield to cover the screen (Clear plastic) I mared up from a sticker attached to it. Looks bad & unclear in that area (top Portion). Can that be replaced? Both phones the same way.
"Real nice, they work well and stay on well.  Happy with the both covers"
"Great introduction to VR. My wife and friends all loved it. There are many apps, but not quite enough content at the moment. For anyone looking for a cheap way to experience VR - you're in for a treat. Minus one star because you need to hold it."
Easy  fit
ok
Super cute but the shark came off the phone in less than a week.  The words stayed on but not the design.  Really disappointing.
"I received this in the wrong size. Oddly enough I ordered two, one for a regular iPhone 6 and another for the 6 Plus. The protector received for the 6 Plus was broken and this protector was the wrong size, looking as if it might fit an iPhone 5 - big difference! I'd stay away from this vendor and order from the multitude of other vendors offering screen protectors for your tech toys."
"Don't waste your time installed it right and followed instructions, now all i get is a beeping noise from phone. Waste of time and money. I want a refund but good luck getting that"
They is the really poor quality<br />Falls were not<br />4 corners broken down
Just as described.
"Ok so far, material could be more sturdy but no regrets."
"I LOVE THIS! Great little wallet. I don't like to carry a purse, so this suits me perfectly."
Works
These worked perfect in my phone. So happy not to have had to buy a new phone.
Works great
Good protection.
It arrived broken!!!
Horrible. Phone was DEF not new as described. Just the worse deal I have done on amazon
I could say is good but I don't use because I ordered wrong one.
Very nice.  Fits exceptionally well.  Daughter loves the color.
Works and looks great.
color was lighter than shown
"I purchased two of these cables this year.  The connector fit nicely through my Speck case just as an official apple cable did.  Unfortunately, neither cable made it past 6 months before becoming intermittent and then failing.  My son used one of the cables and may have been hard on it.  The other was for me and was only used occasionally."
Not yet best color but works really well. Can charge my phone and table to full capacity
Easy to use. Battery meter and a fast charger for all your devices. I got mine last week and plug it to my car port and right away got the measure of the battery so I can even use it while it's off. Of course better to use while your car is on.  Definitely a must to get!!!!
I received the Avantek universal cell phone car mount from Avantek in order to write this review. I had not seen a reason to buy one of these but I was willing to give it a try. I was surprised to find out that this cell phone car mount is very handy. It leaves my hands free to drive yet It puts my phone right where I can see it. So it makes using my GPS maps function so much easier. I wish I had tried one before. Some assembly was required. I basically had to pop the mounting clip into the back of the mount. It was easy to do and I had no trouble figuring it out. There is a retaining ring to keep it in place. It clips on my air vent easily and adjust to just about any angle that I need. The wings on each side of the mount expand with the push of a little button on the back. You simply sit your phone in it and then gently click the wings snugly against your phone. So far it has held my phone securely. We live on a gravel road and I have never had it fall or jar loose. I am very pleased with the Avantek Universal Car Mount. I would recommend it if you are looking for a great affordable way to keep your phone where you can see it.
"case really nice but back hook (which also has a belt look) was just glued on and came off within a week.  Sorry, but not made well"
"Purchased this charger because the usb connector on my nexus 7 (2nd gen.) became loose and the usb cable would not stay connected to charge the unit. It took around 4 hours to go from 5% to 100% charge. It doesn't come with the adapter, but I had a 2.1 amp 5v adapter that I had purchased for another device and it works perfectly. It does exactly what it says it does and is a good value for the price. This was a lot less expensive than fixing the usb port on the tablet and I can use it to charge any qi enabled devices I buy in the future. It is also conveniently portable."
I love my speaker and use it with computer and also to listen to music off my android cell phone and love how it can be set any where in your home and not need to be plugged into computer / phone / power outlet / etc. to use - It comes with usb and aux. cords and to charge it you have two choices : usb on computer or in a usb  phone charger into the wall outlet !
"Since I never play CDs in the slot, this is a perfect place to install the mount, and the clever use of a magnet between my phone and back cover provides a secure and easy grip that doesn't deteriorate like those based on some form of stickiness.  This innovative mount is fantastic."
Battery life is much less than expected.<br />Sounds great regardless of the kind of music<br />Effective @ blocking outside sounds
helps reduce clutter
Wear it almost every day.  Good fit - easy to put on.  Stays in place.  Love it!
"I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase I love the design I got (bark camo) again very happy with what I got I just have two con's, its very hard to take off but does come off and the design on the back feels like one of those wash of f tatoos you'd get at a county Fair or something but I'm holding it will feel less sticky as I use it more , this case fits perfect around my glass screen protected that I bought sepretly and gave the one it comes with to my family member with the same phone but yes one again love it and would recommend to all"
"Very nice, very clean, very (handsome) case. It is exactly as shown in the picture. I recommend it"
"So, the first thing you'll see when you get this is the heavy plastic box. Not sure if I have much use for it, but its nice and strong. The cable itself is well made, with a slightly rubbery coating on the wire. The lignthing end is shiny black plastic, and narrow enough to fit my case. It works fine on all my computers, and the extra length is nice to have.<br /><br />I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review"
I tried this product out and immediately returned it.  The sound was very distorted. The headphones play an on off audio message when the user turns them on or off.  The play back of the audio message was also very distorted.
Case looks great !!  Fits phone perfect
Received it and that day it was leaking water. Really sad because this is so pretty
Amazing products!!
"I am using this phone from one month and I have to say I am really disappointed. With all the big hardware it has, the phone has heating issues if you use internet a lot, do screen mirroring with TV etc. You will also feel a lag while browsing apps and the phone also gets slow."
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
"The case arrived 12 days earlier then it said it would.<br />I love this case. It fits my phone perfectly and it doesn't block any of the ports. The case is made of a hard plastic, and a soft touch hard plastic on the lighter color so I suspect that even if you drop it your phone won't get damaged.<br />It also came with a tool to open the case and a stylus,  which I wasn't aware of.<br />I tried to pry open the case after it was on around my phone, but it was pretty difficult (this could be a good thing)."
fits my blackberry
"Fits my Note 5 perfectly. Yeah... It doesn't go all the way to the edge of the phone but like the description says, the screen on the phone rounds off so that's not really possible. In my opinion, the fit is perfect and the glass is super clear. I was able to install it within 5 minutes with no issues and I am very happy with the purchase."
Was definitely great quality. I fixed my wifes phone now everybody wants me to fix theirs however i didn't see any instructions so I had to watch a few videos on how to properly get the job done.
Nice
Great case for our families purposes.  Not the &#34;tank model&#34; case protector but for the price this is a must get!
"I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.<br /><br />This case is very well built. The card holder securely holds my cards - they don't fall out when shaken around. They are also easy to slide out when needed, much easier than removing my ID from my wallet. The inside of the case is a flexible and softer material while the outer white part of the case is hard. I did drop my phone while in this case and it did bounce itself down the stairs -- my phone survived. The buttons on the case are really easy to push in and use. I am very impressed at the quality of this case for the price that it is. Plus I love the fact that I can throw my credit card or cash into it. Will definitely be buying another one for the hubs phone."
I love this case for my new 5c.  It fits the phone perfectly and is snuggly.  I also love the color and how it is also transparent so that you can see the green of my phone on the back.  This is not a bulky case and fits nicely in purses that have pre-sized pouches for cell phones. I highly recommend this case.
Not a bad product for the price. Would have been great if they had a swell too.
"2 issues  -  Once I turned on the circle apps and installed this case,  my battery drained twice as fast as usual.  I ended up turning off the circle apps, which kind of makes the case just a case...  with a hole in it.  Second,  the wireless charging doesn't work.  I have a Motorola 360 watch and a Qi charging pad. The watch charges fine but this case doesn't. But hey, it looks nice."
I wasn't expecting a PAL charger with a separate adapter; otherwise it was a great purchase.
Nice comfortable set of phones...great stereo sound...customer service is fantastic...My pair were delivered damaged and I got a replacement in two days.
Simplistic and effective! A definite purchase!
The friend I purchased this for LOVES IT!
Excellent!
It works but I still have to carefully position the phone first.
"It cannot support the weight of an iPad mini like the photo shows.  This product is a lie.  it will hold a smart phone, but the arm is so weak is will slowly bend down like melting clay."
Great product for the price
This case is so beautiful and stones are secured really good inside the case. Great package deal!
"Installation was pretty easy as it just uses a long USB cable to connect to my F750. However, I mistakenly assumed that the camera's up orientation would follow the lettering of the label on the back of the camera. Once I had powered everything on and checked the camera view on my phone...I saw that it was upside down with no obvious way to change the orientation in software. I had to remove the camera, find some replacement 3M tape and reinstall with the correct orientation. The video quality is decent and my only complaint is that there are no orientation markings on the camera itself or in the minimal installation instructions."
Great charges phone insanely fast
great
Don't stick correctly
This item sucks!!  Had it on my phone for not even ten minutes and when i go to slide my finger down on the screen the whole screen protector moved with my finger. The screen doesnt stay stuck to my phone. It is pointless and a useless product.  Waste of money
lousy product breaks easily and cost just as much to get a replacement.  Not worth it.
It works as advertising.
It does its job and beautifully fit.
It works.  Very simple to setup and to use.  Audio quality is excellent.
Works great every single time!
Good
"After two weeks, the speaker started making this continuous noise (like tornado warning sound).  DON'T buy!"
Seems as good as stock
Great product.  No problems putting together.  Soft rubber.  Works really well to protect device.
"I purchased the Multiple USB Charger-USB Wall Charger, USB Car Charger for my father who still has the older model iPhone 4. It has become close to impossible to find a high quality charger for the older iPhones so I was really happy to find one that includes both a wall charger and car charger.<br />This retractable cord is excellent, something I've been looking for for quite a while.  My father has a cat who has managed to destroy every charger cord he's had so being able to retract the cord and make it invisible will keep his paws off of this one! Chargers I've owned in the past always seem loose, either at the USB plug or at the phone plus but this one is very secure which helps ensure a complete charge.  The charging speed is comparable to the original cord we were given with the phone, not slower as I've seen with other cords.  Overall I'm very happy with this purchase!<br />I received this product at a discount for my unbiased review"
I am Very pleased with this product. It even enhanced that look of the screen. ☺️
"I've been using it for a week and it slowly stopped tracking my sleep each night, now is not tracking it at all. It seems to track steps pretty accurately for me but definitely not sleep. I will be contacting the company but from other reviews it sounds like they aren't very helpful."
Does what it's intended to do: kkep the Nuvi charged
"Its prefect for my galaxy 4 , just fit in"
ok
"Work great, price great"
As expected
Really easy to install! The YouTube video was very helpful!
great buy super fast shipping a+++
Good Quality product.
Arrived in great condition.  Worth the money.
Work great and up to 15 feet away from phone.
Good product
"Wonderful, thank you."
"Works great! Lost my good one that told me who was calling.  But, this one does a good job, easy to pair, easy to use."
works great as a replacement speaker! i needed one for my blown 98' Dodge ram front speaker. does the job just fine!
"This is a great case that I would recommend to anyone, but I did eventually get another case because it had a stand so."
Great iphone cover love it !!
This case fits like a glove.  Very nice!
the radio  still  does  not work  with it
These things are great.  Perfect for road trips as I travel a lot.  I can see my phone at night using my alarm app.
I love this case . The clock is beautiful and classy looking . The case is classy looking . I like very much that I can answer the phone or take pictures without opening the case . Can't say enough about it
"mouth guard was purchased for my grandson. he was very much impressed with it. the charger even though i haven't tested it yet, i feel will help me in my travels."
Great price. Makes a neat holder for the Apple Watch while charging.
Shipment and product was as presented.  I received 2 days before expected date.
"I ordered a replacement battery for my Samsung tablet.  It was kinda hard to get the case open and the old battery out but after that, we inserted the new battery and my tablet is like new again.  Great purchase from Amazon."
"Works so far. The solar charge as others have said would take forever. The cords that came with it are pretty junky but a usb charger cable is pretty inexpensive. I'm happy with it so far. My only complaint is how insanely bright  the indicator LEDs are. We had a power outage and I was able to see to get around the house just with those. Charging it at night, I had to put something over them for the blinking to not keep me up. I was able to charge my phone at least twice."
Great product
Great find.  Very happy with this purchase.  Very useful for travel.
"It states 10,000 mAH....... In all honesty it's more like 6,500-7,000 mAH.<br /><br />But still a good product for the price of $13.99.<br /><br />My main concern is how long this product might last. I hope it gives me at least 1 1/2 years of life. Only time will tell.<br /><br />My rating is as follows:<br />5 stars for the price<br />3 stars for the product<br /><br />Giving it an overall rating of 4 stars.<br /><br />If anything changes in the upcoming months I'll update my review."
Very sturdy
"Out of the two different tempered glass screen protectors I have bought, this has to be the best quality that I have used. I am the type of person that drops my phone often and the screen itself has protected my phone. The screen protector itself really feels like a glass, not some knock off kind of glass. It has definitely cracked since I had it, but I can say that it is of GOOD quality. I would recommend this out of the other temper glass that I am testing out as well. Id definitely would repurchase this again"
Works well!  A little smaller than the actual screen. It looks nice though.
💯
The item was broken within couple of weeks after a small drop.
Just perfect .<br /><br />That is what I need .
Good
Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
"I was initially unsure about buying a phone from anyone other than my carrier. I wanted this phone, however, and it was no longer available through my carrier. Amazon customer support helped me on the phone, making me feel 100% comfortable going outside my comfort zone. I LOVE my phone. It arrived in perfectly new condition, there were absolutely NO ISSUES. Thank you Amazon customer support!!"
LOVE this case!!!
"Great lightweight but protective case!  I usually don't like cases, since they seem to make the phone feel too bulky, but after I dropped (and broke) my old Moto X (with no case), I thought it would be a good time to buy a case.  This works well while staying out of the way. Thanks!"
Love it!!!
The size is not correct since it not cover the display 100%. It seems it has not been cut properly.
Product does a great job at protecting my ipod. Great feel and fits good. The cover does come over the edges all around which is great. Would have 5 stars if it was a lil tighter fit.
"Very nice looking case, i dident want a case for my alpha cause its a really pretty phone as it is, but this case compliments it very well, looks nice and definitely looks like it will protect it from a good drop, though the way it was packaged(in a soft package) it got a little damaged, dident break the plastic but theres a bend in it, not returning it cause i dont want my phone to go unprotected for a week...  Update: owned it for a good few weeks now, still like it but had to deduct a star cause the gold color is peeling off around the edges, looks a bit ugly now, its not peeling on the back... yet."
Functions as advertised.  Initially unaware of dual sided tape used to keep Charging Set in place when reinstalling back to phone.
Nice and sturdy...
All but one cord has stopped working and takes hours for it to fully  charge my phone or tablet
"Nice and clear, easy to apply, smooth to the touch. Very happy with this product. You peel one side, apply to phone, and then peel off the second protective film. These are the type I find work the best."
"Nice looking case.  Snug, looks like good corner protection without too much bulk."
Love it!
"I was curious how much Base they would produce I was greatly surprised for a 4 inch. Great sound overall, large magnet does it. For the price great drivers."
Good
Horrible
Such bad quality. Did not protect my phone when it fell. My phone shattered completely as well as this cover. Have to pay $150 to replace the screen
The paint used to make the sides of the case look metallic was already chipping when the item arrived otherwise the red looks like what is shown in the picture.
Great seller. Good item
"Great Update to my old phone, and at an unbelievable deal."
its so useful
"Prompt shipping, came sooner than expected.  This is my second one - the first one busted when my phone dropped, but my phone is unscathed.  Fits my iPhone perfectly."
Seems to be living up to its reputation but I have only had its month . I would recommend it to others
These cases always meet or beat any Otterbox on the market I have owned several of both and am always much more pleased with my trident experience as they tend to hold up longer
"I use it when I run, it occasionally skips audio but moving my phone to my right side alleviated the issue. The battery doesn't last more than a couple of hours before needing a charge."
love it
Works great
This is my third battery (and largest) from Anker.  This battery is very well-made.  It does have a little bit of weight to it but that makes it feels very solid.  Seems to never run out of power.  So far I am very satisfied with this battery and highly recommend it.
This case is soo cute! So girly and the colors are really pretty! I really recomend.
great protection and not overly bulky.
This is my second LUVVITT tempered glass screen cover. I dropped my phone (which is not in a fancy case just a rubber-y colored slip) face-first a few feet down onto a cement floor obviously my heart dropped when I picked up my phone and saw the shattered screen. I winced as a peeled off the screen cover but THANK THE PHONE GODS my screen was still perfect. I am a customer for life!<br /><br />Fits my Galaxy S5 Active perfectly.<br /><br />Easy to install. The kit comes with a lens cloth and cleaning wipe. Try to line everything up the first time. My first attempt at applying the screen it attached a little skewed and I peeled it off to re-attach. The corner I used to peel the screen protector off had a air pocket under it for the remainder of the time it was on my phone but the screen protector stayed secure for 5 months until today when I replaced it.
Love this case!!
perfect
Really nice case! I would have rated 5 stars if it could hold more cards.
"Not sure why everybody rate it 5 stars. For me, this thing started to break after 2 months. First it's just one port not working. I was like &#34;OK, at least I still got 4 working ports&#34;. But then they just quit functioning one after another. Now I only got one working port after 3 months, and not sure when it will turn into a brick.<br /><br />Now after reading through all the negative reviews, it seems that this is definitely not some &#34;rare&#34; incident. It's pretty common that this thing will stop working after 3 months. I'm wondering why so many &#34;5 star&#34; ratings - this seems really suspicious. I can only guess there's some kind of &#34;Paid Review&#34; or &#34;Review Scam&#34; going on here. I hope Amazon could launch some investigation into this, to see why such piece of crap could get reviewed so high, out of no reason."
"Wrap around piece broke after 3 days, without being dropped or anything. Not worth the money."
Has saved my phone several times. Usage for 2 years without issue.
"I have found that these don't connect well with my phone.  I haven't tried other phones, but I've tried multiple cables.  I have to jiggle it and set it down just right to get the phone to charge."
Quit Working after 2 months
"It has fewer features than previous high end Garmin had. It is annoying that you cannot add custom POI icons, and simply have a few generic icons to choose from. On the plus side though, I can now easily find the local brothels during my travels..."
"This is by far the best screen protector I've ever had.  It feels, looks and acts like a normal screen.  It was a breeze to install, took just a couple of minutes.  Also, it fit my LG G3 VIGOR perfectly.  The people who reviewed this saying it doesn't fit didn't order for the right phone, there is a difference in the LG G3 and the LG G3 VIGOR.  This is for the vigor, it is a different phone and size.  Edit: I had to come back and add to the review.  A few months after owning this, I had the &#34;ultimate test&#34;.  I dropped my phone, screeched when I saw a crack.  Took off the screen protector and my actual screen was fine.  It did just what it needed to do, the protector cracked, not my phone.,  I immediately ordered a second one, which was just easy to install as the first"
"I'm new to the iPhone scene.  I bought this case due to many positive reviews.  Right now, it fits my needs. The iPhone 5s fits snuggly.  Only issue I discovered today, is that the typical cord that one plugs into the phone jack doesn't fit nicely.  You have to really push it in, versus earbud-like &#34;male&#34; ends.  I hooked it into my Bose system and the case made the &#34;plug-in&#34; difficult, yet it did happen.  I won't be doing this that often, I just wanted to see if I could. The most important thing to mention is that the case does not really enlarge the phones footprint.  I got the iPhone 5s because of it's smaller size.  This case doesn't make it more bulky and it actually allows the user to better grip the phone.  Thanks Amazon, Otterbox, and all those who took the time to write a review."
nope!  doesnt work!  get a message saying this device does not always work!
"Awesome...very nice.  It took some smoothing it, but I'm but very carefulputting these things on. But this fits and is barely noticeable, and had no bubbles, it also seals completely around the edges. ..although I did need to smooth it out a bit. ..I'll post pics soon..."
"Got this Saturday and charged an iPhone 5 and iPad Air. Charged fast! I was happy with how soon it arrived and how fast it charged. Next day, after an hour and a half, my iPad battery went up only fifty percent and was not being used while charging. This morning after charging my phone for two hours it added seventy percent and still not fully charged. Probably defective. Will update how helpful customer service is.  8/31 Just got off the phone with customer service and they will replace the defective cable. No hassles. Great customer service."
Very Pretty! :)
The case will not stay closed and the phone doesn't sit well in the case. It looks better than it works.
This charger is awesome it charges my phone super fast and it's not gigantic so it's portable. Really recommend this charger. I have an S6 and anyone who has one knows the batter sucks. But this charges it up pretty fast.
"I LOVE my wallet/iphone 6plus case!! It arrived on time, as proimsed and in excellent condition."
I needed this so as to charge my phone while on the move. Works great. Order was delivered ahead of scheduler. It's in my car now to use anytime.
"works as intended, with no issues"
"So far, I love my speaker. Out of the box it was almost fully charged - it was great to be able to use it right away. Incredibly easy to install and setup, and day-to-day connecting and playing music is a breeze. While I didn't like the next/previous and volume buttons being the same, I've gotten used to it and actually appreciate the multiple use of the buttons."
Excellent product
Good.
"it works very well, the cord is long enough it fits on top of the dash board with the phone."
Great product. Fits perfectly. Easy to install. Reasonably priced. Looks very good.
Great replacement product!
"Beautiful and functional design. Simple, sophisticated and elegant"
"Do not buy if you have a Samsung Galaxy Note 5. I read a review that said it worked great. It came in, the glass does not match up evenly with Samsung at the top of the phone. It does line up with the front camera or has a slot for the camera but it is too short and won't go all the way to the top."
"Fits perfectly, easy to install."
"Setting not selectable, takes too long to cycle through each information line. Maybe I'm just impatient"
Yes it meet my expectations. Thanks
Have a Galaxy Note4 and after ready some of the reviews was afraid it wouldnt fit when it was in the case. Pleased to say it fits just fine. Makes it easy to position so map applications are easily viewable at a glance
We love this phone mount! It works perfectly clipped to the vent so we can easily detach it and use it in whatever car we're driving. It's strong and sturdy and flexible.
One of the best screen protectors ever!
Cute! Cheap! & fits!
"Black is always my first choice. After buy this headphones i was so excited to get a black headphones, as well as it was my first buy in amazon. Now i am using this super quality headphones which has many nice features. I like their sound system, specially for crystal clear sound,never cut out during listen to song. It fits to my ear comfortably. Battery life much better than other headphones. Happy to get this headphones."
This is the best TPU case I have even seen.  Very good quality.  The fit is awesome.  Very tight and sturdy.  The bumps for power/volume has bit different texture which is super nice.  The color is vibrant and really nice.  Makes my whilte colored phone look super good.<br /><br />I highly recommend this case.  Just really nice.
Great case. Just not sure about the built in screen protector. Considering removing and replacing with one that would attached to screen. It does bounce a little.
"This works well for me. Charges my iPhone 6, doesn't take too long to charge the power bank itself, and the indicators make it easy to see just what I have left for juice. This is roughly the same dimensions as my iPhone 6, a bit thicker, and it is quite heavy, so if you're looking for something to keep in your pocket, this isn't for you. However to keep in a bag as a backup, this is perfect!"
Matches perfectly with the set from my Infiniti DVD system. Worked great out of the box.
"It's a good cover but, the problem it's effect the phone's battery after while"
"Well, my husband had it for less than 24 hours and dropped it and the case shattered."
"Fits perfect, looks great and protects my phone.  Gives you a good grip on your phone so that you don't drop it.<br /><br />Would highly recommend!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review."
Simple and great fit
This was a good product for the price; however within days the black rubber was ripped from normal use.
"It's long, durable & charges fast. The only downside is it doesn't fit in when you have a thick case on your phone. I made mine work,but it was a bit of a hassle. Still really love this charger though"
"Love it.  It's not slippery so I don't worry it's going to slip off and hit the floor. Protects the phone well, and I appreciate the screen guard being included.  Easy to put on and take off.  BONUS:  in bright light it's sparkly; otherwise looks like flat blue.  Color is true to picture."
"Case that fits the phone dosent fit properly and when slid into the holster, stretches the bottom and turns screen on."
"Excellent phone and delivered on time. Had it about a week now and the battery barely needs a charge. Great phone for my son who lost his last one. Verizon is trying to make you pay $20 a month for 2yrs for this phone or $220 cash, ridiculous... Thank you!!!"
Exelent! ! !
Work's great. Just as good as my old one.
Emergency iPhone power when you need it.  Nice size and weight.
"Car Charger - Powerful 3 Port USB Car Cigarette Lighter Charger, Vano - Charge 3 Devices at Once at Full Speed - For Car, RV + Truck - DC Input 12-24V  FOR REVIEW<br />excellent multi purpose lighter port charger, you simply plug it in and plug it in it is that simple. you will find that this is  very high quality before it is ever removed from the box, i suspect you will not want to loose this device and will be angered slightly if such a event happens as well treat it with care my friends"
"Unfortunately, all 4 of them failed in 4 days. First one will not charge whatsoever although the phone says connected. 2nd one tip broke off at the base (never seen that before). last 2 ones will not charge of do anything. honestly, the worst wires I have ever bought. Be aware!"
"I have purchased 4 of these now. Two in silver, one in black and now this one. These are THE best!!  Three of these are gifts. One is for myself.  I highly recommend these for anyone who is considering buying these. They hold their charges if you do not need them right away and when you do need them, they charge your electronics quickly and effectively.  Do not hesitate in purchasing these."
I received the screen protector on time and in excellent condition. It was very easy to apply to my screen. Absolutely no problems or complaints from start to finish. Thank you for a great product.
Great product
Work fine
"This item was bought for a family member  who has a gt-i8190<br /><br />The battery that was supplied by samsung was utter trash no matter what settings i put on her phone the battery would still drain quickly, and it would almost always deplete it 100% after a simple 30 minute conversation. The regular battery samsung included would not even last through an entire day causing the phone to be unusable to a certain point.<br /><br />This battery made things much more easier it made the leather case that was being used before useless because this battery has to be used with the backplate it comes with otherwise the battery will fall out. Before  using the standard 1200 mag battery from samsung the phone was being charged twice a day sometimes 3 times a day.<br /><br />With this battery the phone went from being charged 2-3 times a day to once every 3 days. And this is all with playing some games, texting, and a few calls actually on the 3rd the the battery is still good but its at about 20%. Since the battery is bigger and has more MAH it requires this to be charged double so normally i leave it charging overnight on the 3rd day.<br /><br />I have only used this for 3 weeks, i was a little concerned first because of how some chinese off brand batteries are however this was improve the usage of the phone it was for by far.  If i have severe decline in the battery i will update my review but i hope the battery at least last a good year.<br /><br />It doesn't appear some manufacturers make leather cases to accomdate a larger back cover like this however i found a solution for my family member to use her old leather case. Since the other case has a back cover glued onto the case i simply ripped it off and i crazy glued this battery cover to the leather case and now she can use her old leather case with this extended battery."
love it
This is not a fast charger like it states.  Very disappointed.
"Great quality. Glad I didn't spend $150 for actual Apple product. And no, my wrist is not turning green, haters."
didn't receive any of the lens. i'm disappointed i wasted money on this. definitely recommend you don't buy this product
"I am really impressed with this phone case and holster.  I previously had one of the plastic shell cases and belt clip and that thing broke within 1 month having never been dropped once.  I work in IT and I'm always bumping into stuff while holding equipment with both hands, so the case needs to hold up while on the belt clip as well as the occasional drop from your hands.  This case has strong protection of the phone and it doesn't &#34;bulk up&#34; the phone at all.  I mean seriously, the iPhone6 is wafer thin anyway, so a little extra protection doesn't hurt.  The only drawback is the belt clip will swivel a little easily if you bump into things, but I consider that minor vs. the protection and ease of use.  I'm really enjoying it and I expect to have it for a long time to come.  Nice job BUDDIBOX."
Doesn't  work  !!!!!!!
Excellent service. Great product.
"Audio clarity is excellent.  I haven't had a dropped call since I started using this headset.  I'm am told by people on the other end the call has excellent audio as well.  The headset is a little large and takes a little time to get used to or it did for me.  I wear glasses and that may be why it took some time but I am very happy with the features that my old bluetooth headsets didn't have and the call clarity and reliability they did not have either.  I really like the single use buttons as the mute was frequently unusable on my other headsets but a piece of cake with this one.  As to talk time it seems to be very close to what they claim, I seem to be getting somewhere between 6 to 7 hours between charges.  For someone who uses a headset professionally this headset is well worth the extra coin."
It is very nice to have the speed charger in my cat when my phone is dieing.
Love my case.
Everything great thanks much
Exactly like it was said
"I ordered the wrong size for my phone, asked for an exchange and received one with no problems. the glass fits iPhone 6 perfectly as long as you put it on carefully and correctly."
"I buy this case for every phone I get. Not sure why, but it's my absolute favorite case. No matter how many I try, I end up back with this one on."
"Very simple to replace the battery. Found myself only using only a few of the array of tools provided. Replaced the battery in 10 minutes and it was like having a new phone! This battery will last me all day, and I no longer need to keep a charger with me at all times. Only downside is that this new battery gets very very hot, which is scary sometimes because the old battery never got THIS hot. However, it works well and I'm very pleased. It's been about 3 weeks since I've installed this new battery, and I've had no problems. Thank God!"
Works as advertised.  No issues on my 10.5 S.
"The first one lasted me about 9 months before the door on the back cracked off, not too bad for $15. However the latest one is less than two months old and has already failed. No thanks."
Great phone case!! Very unique and attractive. Exactly what I was looking for. Beautiful design.
This cover fit perfectly...it's whimsical...cute...everyone that has seen it loves it...
Great product so far
Broke the first day followed instructions and everything. Inside snapped while adjusting to fit my phone. I do not recommend and request a replacement or refund!
As described and arrived earlier than it said. Great product .
It's very thin.. not a life proof case by any means. but I love the gold pineapples. I get a lot of compliments on it.
Very cute case. My daughter loves the princess in her iphone. So far the case is being sturdy and doing it's  job.
Wrong size. No good description on the website
Long as I as i could play Iheartradio or my music player and im good
Every colorful and a great case to have. It also works.
Cheap material. I would not buy again.
"Does not stick does not work no adhesive dried up , so pissed!"
thes good
"Arrived fast and everything including the packaging looked brand new. Works well, immediately after plugging in my devices the phone began charging. I haven't had any issues with it, charges my phone to a full clip and I'm good to go."
Love it !!
"This thing is pretty cool, and keeps getting cooler.  The dev team behind it is quite active, adding functionality often.  It takes a bit to get used to, and there are still some quirks, but almost everything is configurable through a simple GUI, so you don't need a dev background to put limiters on The Force.  My amputee friends from the military love that this technology is being developed on a more commercial basis, and hope that use of such devices will not remain a novelty, but become mainstream.  I have to admit, I'm almost to the point in Outlook where reading my email with this thing is faster than my keyboard.  Which means it's almost ready for mainstream.  I think the price tag is worth it, and I think the configurability from the GUI allows anyone to really love this thing within a few minutes of putting it on.  I have to say, it was a cool reaction I got in my first meeting where I made a fist and a blue pointer showed up on the wall screen to underscore the service flow I was trying to demonstrate.  I was wearing a long-sleeved shirt, so everyone was looking for a device attached to my computer, and couldn't.  It was great."
Cool
Hard to put on.
Easy to use and good price :)
Cant complain about this amazing product. Forget about invisi-shield and ghost armor. this product is affordable and reliable. just got the whole family a set of these!
Works really well and very happy with purchase! Excellent value for the money.
Easy to put on. I like the look. Very sturdy
"Great price, Great Seller and good product. can't complain. Thanks I appreciate"
"Overall, this is a good phone case for an iPhone 5/5S.  I have a 5S and it fits well, and I love that it's my favorite color.  For me personally I don't really like the bulkiness it adds to the phone, but that's simply my personal opinion/preference.  Here are some pros/cons I have noticed with the phone.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Includes 2 screen protectors so when one gets dirty or simply needs replacing you have a backup.<br />-Color is beautiful.<br />-Case covers the entire phone (back, sides, and comes over the front border).<br />-There are openings for the speaker and charger on the bottom, the ringer mute switch on the side, and the camera/flash on the back.<br />-Easily fit the charger in the phone while the case is on.<br />-Even with the ringer volume controls covered by the case they are still easy to use and you can feel the button actually press.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Makes the phone itself bulkier.  I have a harder time fitting my hand around the phone/case than I have with other cases, but I've been able to adjust.<br />-The lock button on the top is covered by the case and doesn't always work the first time I press it.  You can't feel the button press like you can with the volume control buttons and I sometimes have to press it 2-3 times for it to lock.<br /><br />*I received this item at a discount to provide an honest review.  My opinions are my own and in no way influenced by the seller."
"well made, quality product"
"it is working very good , thank you!"
Piece of crap! Definitely not 6 amps. My wireless charger charges my s6 edge faster
not a good case for me
Love this speaker. Loud and clarity is unmatchable. The company stands by their product and wants you to be 100% satisfied and I am. Thanks for everything.
"At first I didn't think this case would be too good at keeping water out but boy was I wrong. Works just as it should and item was exactly what was described. I gave this case 4 stars instead of 5 because you can't use earphones while the case is on. That is the only negative I could find about this case.<br /><br />Also, I was sent this case at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. Definitely recommend."
"Have had lots of compliments.  Very sharp looking, good quality. Love the led display for added privacy of my homescreen. Favorite case so far! It's almost magical how the display appears through the leather case."
For a quick burst of power for my phone it's hard to beat the price. It won't fully charge my phone but 45% will do in an emergency.
"Not impressed at all.<br />The front of the case is too big, so it's hangs over the side of the phone when closed. It barely stays closed without a magnet, which is disappointing. The interior black fabric attracts any and all dust and debris, and the case constantly looks dirty. I had it on for less than a day and bought something different."
Came wrong color
The packaging on this phone case was amazing.  The phone case is excellent smooth easy to grip fits the phone perfectly. All the holes are in the right spots nothing covers important spots that are vital to smartphone use. Have no fear if you order this it will be protected from the best packaging I've seen on a phone case delivered from amazon save the expensive otterboxes. This case is amazing and will protect from minor falls. Loving it so far. I received this item for free for a honest review.
good
Way too big for my S6. Extremely disappointed
Been good so far. Did pop off once when I dropped it but snapped right back on.
Worked nicely!!! Easy to use and well made. Just what I needed to install and after market radio.
"First of all i can say this product is really worth for the price . I saw people using selfie stick nowadays and i decided to buy one for me and searched here , Also some of my friends recommended to buy from here , Then i ordered selfie stick and really surprised to see the perfomence , I was really sick taking selfie with hand , Now this stick saved my time , Two features which i like is it must be foldable and easy to carry and the other thing its bluetooth portable and with a button to take selfie easily ,To be honest this product is 100 % worth of the price and also 100 % recommended from my side ."
"I absolutely love the JoyGeek Bluetooth shutter remote! This button is perfect for me. I review on Amazon, obviously. With this button I can create review videos with ease! The button hooked up to my iPhone 6 with no problems. And, it's so easy to use! All you have to do is go to your camera app, smile and push the button. If your going to do a video, it's the same process! I love how fun and easy this product is to use. I was sent the shutter button to test out and review. It is such a helpful product! I no longer have to reach across to cut my videos off. I am so thankful for this product!"
Excellent product
"None of them worked with iPad Air 2, IPhone 5 or 6."
"I was sent this case by anker for a honest and fair review.<br /><br />The case fit the phone impeccably and the button holes and camera perfectly align with the phone. However the case did come into contact with my screen protector but I used some cheap ones off eBay so I don't know if the anker own brand would have been any better.<br />The leather on the case is beyond premium quality, like the title suggests, and is incredibly smooth to touch. The leather itself has a slight padding underneath it.<br />The magnetic clip is strong enough to hold the phone in place but not too strong that you need to wrench it to get it out.<br /><br />Two critiques I do have is:<br />-the flip stand design is not brilliant. Why?, because the dent in the fabric is so small the phone easily moved while in flip position.<br />-the top of the case is entirely exposed, as in the past this is one of the places I have cracked my phone, I would have liked more protection there.<br /><br />This case is of superior quality to any leather case I have ever had and I would recommend the extra couple of quid to protect your beloved phone.<br />I think this case is an exceptional case and a definite buy for anyone interested in a Samsung S6 case."
"I am very happy that I purchased this phone. I switched from a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 because it was outdated and just too big! I was sick of it. So I went out to T-Mobile to upgrade to a new phone but I couldn't find one that was significantly smaller than the Note 2 (5.7&#34; screen). They just do not make normal sized phones anymore. That is where the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 4.7&#34; comes into play. It is the PERFECT SIZE. The only thing big about this phone is the name! Good specs for somebody who just needs a phone for normal use. Yes, it is not the fastest phone out there but for the money, you CAN'T beat it! To be honest, it is very snappy to me and the screen quality is great. Not to mention, the 13MP camera is extremely fast and takes good quality pics.<br /><br />I highly recommend this phone!<br /><br />Also note, in my experience, the Amazon free shipping was extremely slow! I would upgrade to the next available shipping method if you want your phone in less than a week."
waste of money.  dont buy.
"Overall great selfie stick.  I had to order another phone mount  because my Galaxy Note 4 with Otterbox would not fit.  But,  the stick itself is sturdy.  Would be a little scared to even put smaller phone in mount because the spring is not the strongest.  I ordered a XL RetiCAM for stick  mount.  With that combo,  you will have top-notch unit."
This is perfect. Just like the one that comes with my Samsung S5 galaxy. It is really great price and nice to have more than one as I can take this when I travel and have on in another room when I am home.
"The case is great, I especially enjoy the kickstand on the back."
"This is a perfect phone holder for your car. Works perfectly. It comes with two magnets to fit any size phone.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Ease of Use/easy to install<br />Small, powerful magnet on the vent clip.<br />Visually appealing while remaining small and mostly unoticeable.<br />Quick - Just pop it on the vent clip and you are done. Takes less than a second.<br />Mobility - Take it in and out of any car. Easy to travel with.<br />Works in any car (with a vent) and with any phone<br /><br />CONS:<br />None<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
So far so good. Strong hold  bendable bar could be stiffer but it works good
great itim
good one
"Bought this for my son's birthday because he wanted a great case for his iPhone and this is the one he chose.  It shipped promptly and came as described.  Within two weeks my son dropped his iPhone in a shallow bowl of water and it was submerged for about 5 seconds.  Water had gotten under the case, even though the case &#34;appeared&#34; to be tightly clamped.  iPhone was immediately removed from the case and placed in a bag of rice for the next 5 days.  No dice, iPhone is ruined.  False claim on the water resistant description.  If you want a case that looks nice, then go for it.  If you want a case that actually does what it says, then pass on this one."
"This worked great. Perfect for driving with gps or music. Works good for iPhone 6, but I upgraded to 6plus and it does not fit"
My daughter received her tablet case quickly and she absolutely loves it!
works good and charges fast
Fits great
Loved my new case..was right color. ..fit nicely on my phone. .arrived on time
"Save your money, a few dollars more and you can have a nice unit, lots of little things out of sync.like you have to figure out how to delet / add radio stations[ 3 week no luck], trying to get the right mounting kit is a frustrating exercise, instruction book is as clear as mud"
Great product at a very great price
"Love this case. The fit is perfect and the back doesn't seem to scratch easily. The front lip keeps the screen off of whatever you place it on so you don't have to worry about taking advantage of the edge lighting. Easy to put on and remove, overall great case."
It still needs you to restart tablet before it will work
"This item is highly recommended and not only for the shower but for us older people it can be used as a speaker, you can lay down and have it on and talk without holding your phone and once you finish taking play some music if you like. It sticks to surfaces with a suction cup which is awesome. Have purchased at least four now as gifts."
"Really great case! Good size, weight and durability."
"Awsome case. My girlfriend loves it. It allows you to carry ids, credit cards, and cash without having to carry a purse."
Super smart watch. I love the notifications without having to check my phone. Great for meetings or when I'm on a job site.
Bad material!
"Fits phone perfectly. A little struggle to get the phone out of the case, but I got it to protect the phone and will not be taking it out often. So okay with that."
"This is a great product. For me, the comfort of the design and material is what I was looking for in an armband. I don't want to be thinking about my armband when I'm struggling through a run. I just don't think you could get an armband more comfortable than this one. I forget that it's there."
Metal. Heavyweight. Lots of adjustment angles. I use it every night when watching/listening to shows. Doesn't pull off the nightstand easily so I don't have any worries if I fall asleep with the headset connected to the phone. The edges are padded so it does not scratch a surface if it does slide.
"The larger bottom portion is easy to install, the thinner top is a bit tricky.  Watch the tabs."
"A great GPS with accurate maps, easy to read to display and loud speaker for good audible descriptions of what route or changes to make make to said route."
Now I have someplace to plug in all those USB devices without having to take up space on the power strip
garbage! The rear credit card door wont stay closed! Molding around the case is uneven. Don't do it!
I'm going to return it  it was awful
"It's a nice iPhone 6 Plus Case and appears to be a good quality product. I think I would use it on traveling time. has slots to put your id and credit cards. Nice that it has a hand strap so when taking pictures if you drop your phone, you have the hand strap attached to your wrist to save your phone from falling to the group. And the magnetic snap to open and close it quickly. I love  the look of it and the feel. It is easy to clean and appears to be durable for long lasting. I love this vintage look. It's made of PU leather which is also described as split leather. It is a material made with a split leather backing covered with a layer of polyurethane (hence the term &#34;PU leather&#34;) that is applied to the surface and then embossed.<br />I think this will be durable enough to last a long time, but I will have to determine that over time.<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review"
Worked like a charm
"This has saved my phone from a broken screen a few times. The protector cracked, but my screen was spared."
"its a decent phone case however after about three months the kickstand broke on me, and also trying to get this case off of your phone is a pain in the rear. i hope you have some tools to pry it off or some strong fingers"
"can't even tell it's on the screen,great product"
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
Very impressed with product.  Super easy to attach to my LG G4 and so much brighter than the plastic protectors I've used before.<br /><br />Great experience
Does the job.
this is great
"Love the look, the feel, the sturdiness. This color combo is really sleek and unique."
Looks really nice with gold iPhone. Installed on an iPhone with tempered glass.
Very poor broke in 2 days
"As described, works well with my Samsung S4 phone, fast charge."
"The battery works fine, but I am still disappointed with the seller.  I accidentally ordered two of these batteries and the seller would not take back the extra and refund my payment. Now, by the time the first battery wears out the second will probably not be viable anyway."
Excellent
had a little snag activating the phone . After a US based person got on line they activated the phone and it works great.
So nice and pretty too.
Great holder for my LG G Vista. Very durable and protective. Great price.
thanks
I definitely would recommend
"Just recieved it today , havent used it yet but seems like a good product that will do the job."
Didnt came with the pink case offered. 1 week of use and the screen go bad damaged with strips.
I wear this every day and it has helped me get up and move. I find myself checking the band during the day for  how far I have walked and if I need to walk more to get to the distance I need then I get up from the computer or tv or sewing machine and walk. I have gotten better exercise since I received my band than I had in the last year so I am loving it.
Simple solution and worked very well.
good product
Worked for a day then simply stopped responding to touch. Day three the screen went black and never came back on
Great phone case! Love the designed! Have received so many compliments!!  Fast shipping and great price!!
"Holds 2 credit cards and 1 driver's license. At first I was skeptical about it's ability to hold these 3 items without them slipping out, but they do stay in the holder. Sometimes it is hard to get one of my credit cards out, but that's a good thing. The back does scratch easily, but I don't view that as a problem or a defect. It is a natural part of wear-and-tear from my perspective. And it's purely cosmetic."
Good
Way TOO large for my earpiece and it's cheaply made.
I get compliments on these all the time.
I had an adapters similar to this one that I bought at Walmart; I had it for 3 months before I broke it out of frustration and anger. It did this annoying thing were it would continuously skip and create the most obnoxious noise. Ended up throwing it out of the window. So I had to buy another so I could still listen to music. This is a huge improvement! I've had it for 3 weeks and I am very happy with my purchase. It doesn't skip or make weird eerie noises. It also doesn't randomly eject when ever it feels like it. Has great audio. I would highly recommend it to anyone that has anger issues. Might be two bucks cheaper at Walmart but it'll save you a lot of frustration in the future.
"I have received it,  at first it fitted my phone and it looked nice however after using my phone for 7 hours i recognized that the touch quality became unfortunately ridiculous and i need to press and hold every button like old phones which made me removed it,  so i paid for two screen protectors and i will not use them."
I very much like the stylus for my iPhone but it doesn't work at all on my iPad.  The main reason I made the purchase was for the iPhone so I'm not that displeased with them.  Giving them to friends that I hope they will use and enjoy.  Great value.
So great I bought one for my mom too. Very handy for face time if you have your hands full ir just don't want to hold the phone and great for kids to have when they chat with grandma :) they won't fight over who is holding the phone.  Use it in the kitchen when talking to husband. this holds my iPhone 5c and husband's iPhone 6.
Really cute case.
...cheap stuff...if you put the metal piece inside the case and not glued on the outside it won't hold....specially on heavy duty cases...
Works good!
It was a gift.  So hopefully it worked what it was intended to do.
Great Apple Watch stand.
Works like the factory cable!
"Flashy, flashy, flashy!!!  I was looking for a bit of flash and this case has it.  The case holds my phone perfectly.  It is easy to grip.  Great price for a very nice case."
"perfect for an ID and credit card, with room for cash while securing your cell phone stylishly."
"I ordered this as a back up case because I have had a phone case design peel off the plastic shell and I was nervous to get a new one from amazon, but I love my new case and the purple back up rubber case is exactly what I ordered."
love it fit perfect
"I'm going to return this.  I tried many of the options - attaching to the vent, to the dash.  It stayed for a little while than usually when I made a turn - it would go flying across the car or drop under foot. Didn't stay on the dash - don't fit together well."
I bought 2  a couple weeks ago. Already 1 is causing my iPhone 6 to reject it as uncertified. The other is okay so far.<br /><br /> Also I wish the light was only on when charging instead of always when plugged in. I have a different make of lighted cable that's only lighted when plugged into a device.
Useful
the colors and good material
"keeps the fone screen safe that's for sure ,,"
I was surprised that it is very good and it has a sticker guide that helps it adhere to the exact position..  There are is a halo effect on it and that is because of the curved screen on the phone..
I verified that it is the model advertised but it did not fit the phone.
"Awesome product, fast shipping, thanx alot!!!!!"
great phone
When we received the product it was cracked and we had to send it back for a refund.  We then purchased a screen protector from Verizon!
Bought 7 for whole family friends!<br /><br />My son dropped his phone TWICE - cracked the screen..<br /><br />This effectively &#34;fixes&#34; the phone - just replace the top screen and this product helps &#34;squeeze&#34; the crack shut...
Love this. Charges everything for my tablet to my wireless mouse.  Have it set up at the computer and it works as advertised. I would recommend  this for anyone needing a USB port for charging.
"This phone cost about $20 more than the avail 2, and some other phones. The quality of this is like going from a regular car to a Cadillac.It works so easy,and has far more features,than one would want,and more than you'd expect from a phone at this price.Try it, you might like it!"
It works well ... I cut a hole in the back to allow my extended battery stick through. wish they would put scoring on the inside to mark where to cut for the extended battery. OH well the case works well in a difficult phone to make a case for.
Love this phone case! Fits perfectly on my iPhone 6 plus. Got here in less than a week. Nice packaging!!
"Works wonderful, will purchase again."
"This was a SAMPLE case that was sent to me for testing / review. I simply love these cases and appreciate the workmanship and design. They are not Bulky, they are nice and slim. The fact that the back can be interchanged with a different color is a big plus because after a while, everyone likes change, the gray and gold look pretty good as well. The Buttons are nice and accessible and the openings are sufficient for camera, charging port and the headphone jack. Would I recommend this? Yes I had purchased one of these for my Galaxy S5 because of the quality."
Wasn't sure when we ordered these if they would be any good we've had them for some time now and they protect the phones very well.
Love it....
I have had this case for a year and it's still kicking!
They are not good for gaming.  They &#34;glide&#34; but do not pickup items and move them.  As in &#34;Words with Friends&#34; can't drag letters over.  Sorry that I tried them!!
This is a great case for the phone. I am a big fan of the OtterBox cases. They WILL protect your phone. Please be aware though that the cases are large and make the phone bulky so just be ready for that.
Strong as expected but a little tight on the rail but fit well after some effort
Great
We've had it for a month and so far seems to work as described.  Can get  4-5 phone charges out of it.
These have worked perfectly with the Lifeproof case I have on my iPhone 5.<br />Well made and much cheaper than paying 19.99 for just one through the original company.  Shipping was fast and packaged great.  Thank you.
Easy install. Looks amazing.
"The Colorful tree version of the S6 case did not fit the S6, it almost did, but the bottom right corner of the phone was hanging out just enough to expose the frame.  When it fell off my knee today (with the case open, as I was using the phone on speaker) that corner of the screen shattered.  No matter how much I have tried to fit that corner of the phone into the case, it will not fit.  A new screen on a S6 is $235, I am very dissatisfied.  The case also interferes with all of the chargers, including the Samsung charger.<br /><br />I have used these cases before on my S4, and I love them.  Hopefully, I can find a better S6 case."
very strong and robust car charger. great product
Love this case really sturdy too
"I am rough on phone holsters. These fit my iPhone 6 very well and I order them 2 at a time. They have a belt loop, so I don't lose my phone by it slipping off."
"It worked great  until it fell off the windshield and the glass shattered.  Suction cup worked well for a few months. then it started falling off constantly. then one time it fell and did not survive. touchscreen is now non-functional.  Update: I called Garmin CS (800-800-1020, got thru right away).  Got several good suggestions for the suction cup.  clean glass and suction cup with rubbing alcohol (not windex) and micro fiber cloth. wet cup before applying to glass.  or try the portable friction mount.  And then, even though my warranty is expired, they offered to repair it for free (replace with refurbished unit).  I am very happy.   Performance wise, the Garmin is the best. So I am happy to stay with the brand,  I bought the friction mount on amazon an it stays on the dash solid as a rock."
Perfect fit. Just read the instructions.
Works great.
love this case....
Works great!
Better than the original.  The extra length makes charging much easier.
These cables work well but I find that sometimes I have to flip the connector over and plug it back into the iPad or it will tell me that it is not charging and sometimes they can be a bit finicky and you need to keep plugging them in for it to say it is &#34;charging&#34;.  But heh for the price I can live with it.
l like its so cool
"covered, protected, clear sheet of plastic , if installed correctly works great i personally upgraded to ballistic glass the installation wasn't as tedious but its far more expensive."
Best screen chield I have ever had.  Easy to apply and remove if needed.
"Love it - using it to charge 4 iPads, 1 iPhone, and 1 micro-usb device (Android phone, Harmony remote. bluetooth speaker, etc.); a little cable management is necessary (http://www.cloopband.com/ for me) but my 3, 6, and 7 year olds work with it very well;"
Charges my devices nice and fast. It DOES NOT quick charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 however which I was led to believe it would from Q&A here. I assume this is proprietary or something not yet supported by Anker.  I'm keeping it though because its a decent solution for my many devices.
The Anker charging unit is perfect fit to fix our problem at home for lack of UBS ports for charging our smart gadgets.
Its a good device for travller
item just exactly as was described .. i love it look like a brand new phone
I love this unit.  So far I have tried every feature (except directly connecting my phone - though I've paired it with BT) and they work flawlessly.  Only weird thing is there is a slight delay from when you tap the screen and when the function actually happens.  Same thing also occurs when you first turn it on.  Mine did not come with a manual but you can download it here http://www.jensenmobile.com/mobile-multimedia/?sku=VX4022.  Cheers
MET ALL MY EXPECTATIONS AND GREAT PRICE FOR A BASIC TOUCH SCREEN RADIO
Great case for a great price!
Great case.
Has a hard time getting in the charge position.  You have to make sure it sits in the lighter outlet a certain way in order for it to work.  Pain to get to work.
"This is a great case, true it makes the sleek iPhone a little bulkier, but it is so practical and cool looking that none of that matters. The case can also double as a wallet, which I wouldn't do every day, because my wallet is stuffed with crap, but for going out it's perfect. You have your phone, cash, ATM card, ID and bus pass with you cleverly disguised as a little book. I put it in my front pocket which fits nicely and (I think) helps deter pickpockets. The material of the case feels great, the phone clips in easily and securely and the whole thing seems to protect the phone beautifully. It ships with a cloth to clean your phone (nice!) and a weird little stylus thing (meh). The price is right and I highly recommend it! I included a photo with my wallet for reference, my wallet is not included in the purchase."
Fit nicely in my sentra no issue with it. Looks ok.
Worked great would purchase again if needed. A lt cheaper than buying fro Verizon Store
Loved the watch until the back of it chipped where the battery charger connected. They cannot repair the crack except replace the whole watch and re-charge a cost that actually is more than what I paid originally.<br />Customer service was also non-existent so made the process worse.<br />Sad to say it was great for a few months.....
None of these 4 cables worked on my phones.
Reliable and cheap battery. This is my second unit. First one is 2 years old and still going strong. Never can have enough batteries.
0 stars but I had to add 1 for some reason. The first time I used this product the plug broke off into my phone. Can not return.
Nice case.....textured on back...stays in your pocket
This is not the replacement for my current remote alarm set/door opener. I am returning them.
It may say that it is unblocked but it doesnt work for virfin mobile it doesnt have the right material and thus doesnt work
I bought this charging cable because I kept getting &#34;slow charging&#34; warnings from my HTC One M8 despite the fact that I was using the factory charger and cable. So far I am thoroughly impressed - this cable charges my phone very quickly and seems durable.
There awesome and people if the pen can Work on your photo me is good and it's even better for the price!!
Magpul really came through with this one!  The dual durometer material is the product improvement I would of asked for too!
It's a fraud. It doesn't fit to my ipad
Great product
Love it! !
very good case
Pretty good replacement for worn out Samsung S5 battery.
Goooood
"This DOES NOT stick at the edges. I was extremely careful while putting it on, followed the instructions carefully, and I have successfully put on 5+ glass screen protectors on other phones. It DOES NOT stick at the edges. There is a noticeable halo effect around the edge of the phone, even though this protector doesn't extend past the flat areas of the screen.<br /><br />Also it developed a hairline crack through the middle in the first week or so, without me having dropped the phone. Probably because it doesn't stick at the edges..."
"While I do love the quick charge 2.0 and the price is right....the only thing I do not like is the charging block, it's bulky and takes up at least 2 slots on my extension cord. Other than that, it's perfect"
"This product is an example of the &#34;get what you pay for&#34; mantra.<br /><br />It broke after the second use, but I was able to repair with a silicone adhesive.<br />The remote clicker was worthless....but we had a remote from a different Bluetooth device.<br /><br />Meh. Buy if you like DIY fixing."
Love it works better than i thought that it would great product amazon had it to me in 2 day which was amazing the sticky pad mounted to my dash and has not moved since i put it there all around great product
I really like this it fits into my purse and I can find it because of the color<br />and it does the job!
I love this case. It's saved my phone more times than I can count!
"I have an old car and with no AUX port or bluetooth. I have tested few bluetooth FM transmitter and the latest one is the Rii Geartist GB01.  The box includes a magnetic back GB01, magnetic backplate sticker & dual car charger. Below are few pros and cons which will help you figure if this product is good for you.  PROS: 1. Packing is frustration free so it good. 2. The design is smooth and nicely done. 3. Its got volume control with channel changer, dedicated FM signal button and a button to accept calls and pause them. 4. Bright FM signal numbers. 5. Good signal once you find an empty one in your local area.  CONS: 1. I faced static sound issues after I started driving my car even once the GB01 was connected. After some driving distance the static lowered and I had to bump up the volume for a better sound.  Lastly I would say that this product is good and has great potential to give you endless musical experience.  Note: I got this product to test and provide my unbiased opinion"
"Exactly as described, at a great price."
It gets high marks from my 2 teenage girls.  It also gets a workout!!
"Excellent, great look but really protective also"
"I have been using this in my car, at work and at a home.  It works just like the official Apple charger."
Nice fitting case.  Provides plenty of protection to phone.
"Lasted for less than 2 months after purchase, Defective product. No longer charges devices. Seems like the cables inside became loose and have a false connection."
"Love this product but for two things.<br /><br />1. I ordered the yellow, and whenever I use flash photography on the rear camera, the image is a bit yellow due to interference from the case.  If the cutout on the back were a bit larger around the flashbulb it wouldn't be an issue.<br /><br />2. The credit card slots are really snug.  The plastic ID slot is so snug I have to really struggle to get my ID in there.  I actually haven't put it completely in there because I don't want it stuck in there."
"I ended up cracking my old screen protector, and purchased another one because it was such good quality"
Very satisfied
Fast shipping. Fit perfectly.  Very satisfied!
Its ight
"Just a great thing to have in the car.  Charges a tablet and phone simultaneously while you are driving, seems like decent quality."
"Phone/batteries still gets hot, but that isn't the batteries fault. However, these replacements are working well even in the heat."
Very slow reaction. I do not like it
"It's great. Looks pretty good. Feels sturdy. Fits my arm well when adjusted. iPhone seems secure and I can access all buttons. I like that it's kind of locked in. I do mostly cardio activity (running, bike riding) and the armband doesn't move around or bother me.<br /><br />Good price for the product received. I'd recommend."
Great quality
"I would have given this 5 stars, however syncing with bluetooth has been a major problem. The first day it worked great. The second day it would not sync and I had to unpair and then pair it up again and got it to work.  The third day even unpairing and trying to pair again would not work and I cannot get them to sync."
"This charger does what it is supposed to do - charges my devices and charges them quickly. My favorite part? My cat doesn't like black cables, so I don't have to worry about having them chewed up on me like I did with the white ones. I would definitely recommend these to anyone else who owns an a-hole of a cat who prefers chewing on white cables like mine."
"I got this stereo for the Subwoofer output. The output doesn't work, I'm getting no sound from my subs. Pretty frustrating."
Not that snug on the ears but otherwise perfect
A very good cable.....works for both Samsung an and my iPhone. ..best
Looks like paper glued to a phone case and was off center wasn't me favorite
Did not install well twice. Had to purchase a different brand.
"his was a gift for my grandson-I asked him if he liked them and he said &#34;Yes! &#34; And when you're talking about 8 year old boys, that's a good response!"
The screen protector was very easy to apply.  If you don't have a good case it does lift if your rough with your phone. Overall it's a good product and I would purchase it again
"Bought this case for my girlfriend so she could have a protective case without the cost of brand name cases. Upon arrival we opened it up and put it on immediately, the two piece design made it super simple to put on. All of the ports, and camera are not blocked in any way. The case also does not make it hard to push buttons, unlike other cases. After dropping her phone several times on hardwood flooring, it's held up very well to the abuse it has taken on. Of course the plastic was a bit slippery out of the box, but easy to get use to. Overall, we would and have recommended this product to our friends."
"This item does not fit the Blu Studio Energy, it is a tad too large. Also does not have the cutout as shown in the picture.<br /><br />go with this one instead.<br /> [[ASIN:B00SWS27Z8 VSTN ® Blu Studio Energy Glass Screen protector - Ultra-thin 9H Hardness 2.5D Round Edge Highest Quality HD clear Anti-Scratch/ Shatterproof / Anti-Fingerprint/ Water Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Blu Studio Energy smartphone]]"
Purchased this for my dad after he took his phone for a swim without a waterproof case. He says he loves it!
Exactly how I pictured!!!
Great charger works better than new.
Bought this case for my husband. So far it has worked like a charm. He likes it a lot and has no complaints.
Super Quick shipping.  Item works very well.
I love them and the fit is perfect. They were just what I was looking for.
Fits Perfectly! Looks great! Feels good!Will order other colors for sure!
arrived right on time.  so pretty fits great!
The item worked well and I am extremely pleased with the outcome. I highly recommend this product.
"I had to send a new phone back to the company and pay for postage which they say the put back into my account. Lots of time.<br />New phone did not work, took it to Verizon to verify it was a bad phone.Now I am gun shy on ordering a phone now and what if I have to send that one back. This was for my son who is still currently using a borrowed phone."
it works great
Love that it's wireless; Bluetooth. I use it on the go. It's loud and clear.
I do not recommend this aux cord. This is my second time buying one that retracts and both have had static and make weird noises.
Band runs smaller than what comes with the Fitbit.  Band breaks and the Fitbit can fall out.
Works perfectly.  Very satisfied.
"I went without screen protectors for awhile in part because I don't like the way they feel. Then there is dust and air bubbles. The glad feels great compared to plastic. Your fingers slide right over it. A few air bubbles were present after application, but they went away after a few days. The only issue I have with this screen is it doesn't work well with thin TPU cases. The lip of the case pushes the corners up and causes air bubbles."
"Just what i was looking for. For the price it works just as i had hoped, some minor issues bring it down a bit but a solid buy for the price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />sturdy table clamp (very adjustable)<br />Long tapering neck (it is malleable and stays where you bend it, which was a nice surprise)<br />Table/phone clamp (i think its spring loaded but it had a good grip on my table so i know it wont go any where)<br />Clamp Opening (has slits on the sides to allow u to plug in the charger and head phones if used in landscape)<br /><br />Cons:<br />sags a bit (I have a Galaxy Tab 4 8in so its a smaller tablet and when i put it it leans forward a little bit, because i watch it in my bed, so i just need to bend it higher to compensate, nothing terrible)<br />Clamp Openings(bc i have a smaller tablet the speaker plug is blocked when i need to charge the tablet and vice versa<br /><br />its a good buy for the price"
A+
Works great!
"As per other reviews, doesn't fit PERFECTLY there is one corner that doesn't seem to smoosh down, but it does fit, and protect and its smaller and less cumbersome than the other model.  This is perfect for the use I needed, and the bright color helps me find it in my purse!"
Works good for wifes phone. No Problems.. :-)
"Its slightly heavy and adds size to your phone, but nothing is breaking your phone with this case on it!! It would be better if the allen key needed was packaged on the outside though. Otherwise perfect case!!"
"It fits the little nokia phone looks colorful and everything else but the rubber is more like some sort of hard flexy plastic more so then a silicone or rubber shock absorbing case like I am used to with other cases.  It's cheap for a reason, I still use it on my work phone, but its more of a pain in the butt then anything else really and the buttons are super stiff and hard to push to make them activate the phone buttons on the side when in the case."
"This case has far exceed my expectations. Not only does the case give my phone a classy look, but it also protects my phone very well. The case it two-fold; the first comes is a soft rubber like material that covers the entire phone, then you finish it off by enclosing it with the bottom and top part that come together. Surprisingly durable and complete access to all ports."
Piece of crap. I put in the first battery pack and it started smoking.  Per instructions.  Put in the second battery pack per instructions and it didn't power up. What a waste of money.
"I am very happy with this purchase. the phone fits great (I have the regular, not the ballistic Turbo) and is secure, so it won't fall out. It feels well protected. I love the kickstand feature. my phone is my alarm clock so it is a nice bonus to have it sit up and hit the snooze that way. For the side buttons for power/volume, they work great. I actually think it is easier to use than the buttons without the case. And I have to love the price. If it isn't the best case out there, it is for sure the best value.<br /><br />The only con I can see is the plastic is a little cheaper grade than I would like. I am still confident in the case, but the plastic quality is lower than I would expect. There is a chance it may crack after a year or so. And if it does, this case is still a steal. but because of the plastic I gave it 4 instead of 5. But even if this case only last a year, I would buy this one again. And I may be just nitpicking and this case will outlive several years.<br /><br />If you got the turbo, this is your best value for a case here"
Works well with both phones and tabs. i Charge it every week and use it 5 times with my S5
Came apart after 2 months use but I was sent a replacement part with no hassles! Hope it stays together-- I don't want to lose my watch!! It is a nice looking band- I do like it a lot.
The fit is horrible - no matter what adapter used the fit is just sloppy. When working it has great quality
It's fast and Apple certified!
"Our son likes to throw our phones on the floor.<br />With this case its safe and i don't worry about the phone breaking. The case is strong, I've even spilt liquids on the screen but the built-in screen protector works amazing!!!!"
"Arrived sooner than expected, was exactly as described, and I love it."
Both cables stopped working this week. The connection between the cable and the plastic broke and frayed the wires on one and the other charges for about a minute and then says accessory not supported. Don't waste your time or money
"The sidewall is a bit fragile. The phone slid off the bed, about 2.5 feet and the side near the volume buttons broke off."
I use it to power my GPS and it works beautifully. My old one would die after about 4 or 5 hours. This one will go for 2 or 3 days without recharging. Great product.
"I bought this after realizing my Ringke SLIM case was not protecting my screen entirely when my phone was inverted. It grips easily, doesn't have much visible branding, and it doesn't block any of the buttons, sensors, camera, or speaker functions. Highly recommend."
Love the colors and the fit. Very light but seems durable.
Really like this product
I hate the Zagg invisibles girls HDX - HD! It's rubbery surface collects every piece of dust that is in the air and it is very hard to clean. It is also hard to drag your finger across smoothly. What I did like was Zagg's eagerness to have a satisfied customer and and to offer me a solution to the problem.
Wonderful case!
"Decorative only, too thin to be of any protection"
Just what I expected - works perfectly
does not charge the battery  i think it is broken
"Amazing product!! The magnet is way stronger than it looks, I live in New York where the roads have way too many potholes and this thing holds the phone tight through all the bumps! Love it!"
It's a lot of fun. Never thought I would buy one but super easy to use. No longer have to ask someone to take family picture.
good
good
Exactly what I expected
"Great case.  I bought this because most of the other cases out there have an extra layer that the phones attaches to, and then the case attaches to that layer.  This one is different in that the back of the phone fits exactly into the case: there's no extra flap.  These phones are big enough now-a-days, and I have this only as a necessity, not out of choice. (Prefer the old nokias and smaller, slimmer phones of the past.)<br /><br />The tit is EXCELLENT, slim and professional.  There are cutouts-- when opened-- to allow for easy access to the microsd charging flap, the magnetic charging port and the lower sim card flap.  The only reason this case cannot receive 5 stars is because the inner cover lining is some kind of soft fabric: a light-coloured grey.  Because of that it picks up dirt like nobody's business.  I have had around 30 cell phones, and I kid you not: this case is the worst one in terms of showing dirt. It is also &#34;wearing&#34;, as in, getting pilly like a winter sweater would.  This is after owning it for a month. If the inside was a black fabric, or a simple textured plastic like the outer case there'd be no issue, however opening up the phone and seeing a dirty, uncleanable flap is unappealing.  One more thing, the inner spine of the case is also showing wear and picking up light black coloring from the case itself, either that or it is &#34;waering&#34; down and showing the black underside.<br /><br />I don't want to scare you, just giving as much info as possible.  I like crisp and clean, the fit is crisp and clean.  The inside of the case, not so much.  If you are a snacker or have dirty hands in your profession or personal life this may not be the case for you.  If you want a case that fits snugly and professionally this is definitely the case for you."
"This is such an amazing case not only does it look awesome it protects my phone 100%. It comes in three layers the first is made of rubber which fits perfectly over my phone. The case doesn't stretch like most rubber cases and it keeps my phone in place (and trust me I've already dropped out a few times and my phone didn't get any damage or fall out. The next layer is plastic and has a stand for easy no hands access which is great when I'm watching videos, cooking, or playing music without muffling the sound. And then there is the plastic case with a clip that I fit on my pants so I can have it easily accessible for when I'm at work. So if I'm not wearing pockets I still can have my phone on me and again it was made to stay in place and not slip or fall off! Every piece was built with high quality materials for durability and ultimate protection. I absolutely love my phone case and you will too! I received this product at a discounted rate for an unbiased review."
"This is a really useful gadget, but it needs instructions. The most important thing to remember with it is that the cover must be open for the battery inside to charge."
This case is a great value for the money. It is very comfortable to hold The buttons fit very well. Overall extremely well-made and a nice addition for your iPhone.
"Worked like a charm for a while but then stopped charging my phone, and have to connect and reconnect the charger to my phone and try and change the angle the I plug the cord in at to try and make sure it charges. No issues with other power cords I use. Should have paid more for higher quality."
"Good, light weight charger"
Absolutely amazing. I got mine and its actually smaller then i had though which is awesome and charges my phone fairly quickly. Also came already half charged which was nice
"Product looks great and was SUPER easy to put on. Love the big sticky screen cleaner to get all the dust off. If I have to get another screen, will definitely purchase the Poweradd screen protector again!"
Excellent. It sure beats the $34.95 that Verizon wanted for the exact same thing.
I've only used it once but it's performing as expected!
It is a very nice cover but takes a long time to get here.
Spend the money on a good set of buds....this would not be the set you want!
"When i bought them i was doubting if it was going to be good. When i got them i didn't like how they look (shape). But when i put them on they were little uncomfortable but when i started listening to them they were awesome sounding. Even though you dont feel the bass you can hear it good. The noise canceling is awesome. What i also didn't like was whrn you turn the volume up or down from the headphones it has beeping sound that are way too loud.<br />Good: good bass, noice cancelation<br />Bad: can't feel the bass, the volume beeps are too loud, shape, and sometimes uncomfortable."
I was able to get this product at a discount for an exchange of my review. The case fits my phone like a glove. I needed a new one since my old one was all scratched up and beat up from all the drops my daughter did while playing with it. With the new case it is as durable as my old one and have no issues with my screen not working or anything. My daughter has already dropped it a few times and the phone is safe! That is all that matters!!! The case saved the phone!
"I've not yet tested the answer phone/hang up phone buttons, but this thing is definitely well worth the money you spend on it if you plan on using it to listen to music from your phone/.mp3 player over your car radio. This being said, make sure your device is Bluetooth enabled. iPhones, iPod Touch, and most smart phones/devices do.<br /><br />It's very easy to install. You just plug it into your cigarette lighter, turn it on, set the FM station you want your music to play over, tune your radio into said station, and lastly pair the device you're going to play music on with the FM transmitter (turn on Bluetooth and select &#34;BC-06&#34; from the list of available devices).<br /><br />It sounds more complicated than it really is. It's very easy as long as you have a basic understanding of enabling and pairing with Bluetooth devices on your music device. Comes with an instruction booklet.<br /><br />As far as quality goes, I can hear a bit of static between songs, but as the song plays, it's exceedingly clear. Try a different FM frequency if you have issues with static. It beats listening to the radio in my area and cassettes, no doubt.<br /><br />It's quite easy to switch songs using the side buttons, and the additional USB ports are definitely sweet.<br /><br />It's possible that there are more expensive products out there that would do better. This is the first one I've personally tried. But again, for what you're paying for it, I doubt you'll be disappointed. I know I've used it pretty much every time I get in my truck."
Exactly what my teenager needed to keep her iPhone from premature breakage.
Great work
"The plug prongs that plug into the wall outlet are set lower than other models like this. The lower placement makes it so that the top of the charger blocks the 2nd outlet. In my opinion, I would prefer to have the use of my second outlet, so this is getting returned."
"Disclaimer:  I got this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I love this portable charging station.  It is one of the best designs that I have come across.  I bought it for travel, as I wanted more than 2 usb ports, and with this, I can plug in my laptop as well.  I love that it has a power cord design so versatile…I can unroll it and it can sit on my bedside table or desk, but if I wanted it to hang on the wall socket, it can do that too.  The only annoyance is the super bright blue indicator light that lets you know power is on.  It does not have to be so bright!!!  I will have to tape over it with masking tape or something like that as I'm using it next to my bed.  I would deduct 1/2 star for that if i could. Packaging it came in was busted open when it arrived.  It looks cheap if I were planning to give as a gift.  However, they made up for it by including a nice pouch to keep it in for traveling, which i greatly appreciate.<br /><br />I wish they would make an international version -- with the interchangeable international adapter plugs, so I can use it worldwide too.<br /><br />Update November 25, 2015<br />I deducted a star because the snap that holds the plug broke when I tried to take out the plug for use.  So, I no longer feel this is the best design anymore, and I've found a similar one with a better design where you slide the plug in, instead of popping it in, and it has pink, blue or green accents. However, I have not written a feedback for that yet as it died on me in about a week of use.  Waiting for my exchange before I review.  At least this one still works great, and I've used it in England and Asia for about 2 months."
Cool product
Perfect
"worst set of headphones i have ever bought, i live with my headphones in my ears, must have at least 17 pairs; this was by far the worst money spent towards headphones👎"
I have bought this item twice and it has broken both times.  I love the ease and feel (sleekness) of the product but it is not a durable product.
"I'm so satisfied with this product. When my screen protector was damaged, I emailed them and they sent a new one within a few days. So glad I ordered this product."
it charges real fast
I'm in love with this case. The colors are really nice they go with each other. It's very smooth and easy to put on. It fits perfectly and it protects.
works as expected.  no Wow factor to earn a fifth star but I am very pleased with the performance.  I also like that it comes with a double sided velcro tape to post to a wall or desk
Very convenient...
"Excellent watch, but not waterproof! My watch is now dead because I didn't know that the only way it is waterproof is for the plastic door to the charging port to be shut!  It is not rubber sealed, just plastic.  The ads touted that the watch was waterproof to one meter for 20 minutes.  I had taken several showers with the watch with no problems at all. I had taken service hours with the watch with no problems at all. But, I took it for a 20 minute swim and it got soaked. It never recovered. Other than that the watch was great.  I was under the impression it was waterproof.  Only on their website does it say that the charging door must be shot to be waterproof. I assumed that they had sealed the area around the charging port. But I was wrong. Later I bought a cheap Chinese replacement for $19 but the sophistication was way below that of the Sony.  The Sony has no microphone and no speaker you cannot use the watch as a phone. But it does alert you that phone calls are coming through you can read your texts and it alerts you when you recieve email. This works very well in an office environment where you do not want all your neighbors hearing your conversation from your wrist watch. The watch simply vibrates and alerts you that your phone is ringing. Quite sophisticated and just what I want.<br />Only wish I had known the conditions for being waterproof!"
"Often indispensable, but occasionally flat out WRONG. Also, when I start it up it sometimes goes back to the previous search without being asked. (I would not get it again.)"
"This radio is a great starter for new hams, at a great price. The only reason its not getting five stars is because the antenna is poor- you will need to buy a better and longer one to go with the radio. Other than that, no complaints."
Nice product at a very reasonable price<br />Will buy again
"I like this item I purchased two, one for me and another for my sister but she did not like her it was too thick for her taste however I love it and I am using it all the time."
good quality for good price.
I'm a utility worker. I'm in my truck & utility rooms all day. Not only does the mount work great in the truck... The magnetic piece on the phone allows me to stick my phone on any bit of metal and work hands free. The Center console on my truck it also metal. No more digging between the seats to fish out the fallen phone... This little novelty item has really simplified my work day. Ive already recommended these handy little tool to my company and co workers... Great product.
Really holds it's charge and I like how I can charge two items at one time.
Fit great. But the design wore out fast. Had to replace after a few weeks.
bought well over a year ago (maybe it's been 2) and it's still working fine!
Tried this out last weekend while in the mountains so I didn't have to run my generator just to charge a cell phone. Worked beautifully! Hooked my GoPro up to it along with my Samsung Galaxy S5 and had both charging immediately. Both devices were fully charged rather quickly.
Ears getting pain if i use more then  5 min
"Space gray is perfect for the gunmetal gray M9. Easy to install, use of power and volume buttons not affected. Have installed for about a month, almost no small particles have gotten under the sides or through camera cutout."
Loses satellite in open areas turns off when your in heavy traffic can't read the screen in sunlight.. Good thing you can play games at least it's not a total loss just 99%
My favorite case so far! It has worn down pretty quickly tho!
Had an issue with product...but Wireless Solutions are sending me a replacement. Excellent customer service!!
Worst case in history of cases it brake when u put it in the spot beside the volume and and power cracked off if I could put zero I would
works just like it should!
Works awesome
Good product. Good shipping.
"Perfect case for the iphone 6, nice coverage"
I love this mini speaker. It's so useful and loud! I last a really long time around 4-5 hours for me. I had Prime so it arrived 2 days after I ordered it. The sound quality is very crisp. I'll order more for friends!!
very nice case.
Great☺
It handles the hard nicks
"I bought Vol&Bass for music. New to the wired world, I bought a SamsungSmart TV. I didn't have to buy separate TV speakers at all. My little speaker helps me hear perfectly now and it doesn't blare out into the room because I can't decipher the speech sounds -  because it 's tiny and sits right by me. I don't even have to look to read lips. From one of the chronologically challenged, this is &#34;awesome.&#34;"
"Great screen cover. The only complaint I have is it doesn't go all the way to the edge of my phones screen. I don't know if it's smaller to fit phone cases. I have the otter box on my phone and there's still a pretty good gab between my screen protector and case protector, so there's quit a bit of dirt that collects on the edges."
Love this cable.  Extra long and the lights let you know when your fully charged
These were great and worked perfectly. Can't beat the price!
"Excellent case. Screen protector is very receptive. No clicking noise. Volume and power button tabs work great. Speaker no issues. Charging and headphone doors have no issues. There is no film over home button. The cutout for the vibrate sketch is deep. The cutout for the front camera, earpiece, and sensor no issues. Nice grip to case. No issues for back camera and flash cutout. Recommend this case instead of buying the LifeProof frè. Cheaper, no screen issues, no muffled sound."
LOVED IT
Makes my husband feel like he's a luxury car when he's cruising around in his 98 blazer. ha ha ha ha
Works as needed
I bought one for my Nikon d7200.  The glass was warped so there was a 3/4&#34; portion on one edge that would not lie down enough to seal to the screen.  (The glass was also a smidgen too small.)
Good product
Great way ago carry my garage door opener too.
Great case
Bought this really cute case for my 13 year old granddaughter. She loves it.
This product is described compatible for Samsung Galaxy S5 however it has micro USB and S5 has 3.0 connection. I tried plugging another cable to the hotcell plug and would not charge. Was unable to use.
nice
They were here on time and they were perfect
Works great with galaxy S5 even with my spigen neo hybrid case. The top flap cardboard separated at the velcro point but I glued it back together. Magnet on the side even works as a button/trigger. Only issue is that it's very uncomfortable after 5 minutes of use
Seem to work really good with iphone 5's and 6's. Seem to be very well built.
"Great case. Fits perfectly and doesn't mess up the buttons. It is also easy to get to all of the ports. The seller also included a stylus, water proof bag/case, a screen protector, and a screen cleaning pad. The case seems like it will protect the phone from normal drops and accidents."
"It is a very protecting case and I would say it was almost worth it. But if you get it, make sure you are getting it for all of its features and not just because it's water proof. The head phone jack cover broke off very easily but was fixable with just a little bit of glue"
When I first got the product I turned it on and it worked perfectly but it Doesn't keep a charge or pair with my phone
works good interesting fits great can't tell its there easy to put on
Works great with all my devices. Small size a plus.
"This was terrible, I do not recommend buying this product. False advertising."
The battery life us good and it's incredibly fast
Good
bad quality
good for price
Protects my phone really well and I love the colors of the case
Excellent condition
Doesn't work well. Comes off easily and bubbles after using.
None of the Chargers worked.
"Works as designed. Nothing flashy, but holds my Samsung Galaxy S4 well."
Fits perfectly.  Very cute
The screen broke within the first two weeks.
These are great. I'm a field service tech and drive everywhere for work. I love the face you can place these anywhere on your dash or windshield.  This fits my iPhone6 (not iPhone6 plus) great while using phone for gps. It works so well that I purchased one for my wife and her Samsung S5 fits it as well and she really likes the iOttie.
Product does what it's supposed to do.  Easy to apply on phone and haven't had any issues yet. This was purchased for my fianc&eacute;es phone.  Compared to the one I have on my phone this is a little thinner but I also paid around 23$ for mine.  For the price it seems like a quality product.
excellent
"Pr Mine lifted on the edges pretty badly but I ignored it and used it for 8 months. It fractured and made a line from left to right when i dropped it at waist height on a carpeted floor, when it was in a rubber case. Also developed a chip months earlier, which is where the crack stemmed from. It did do a great job resisting scratches, and from other reviews and research there doesn't appear to be any good glass protectors for this device, so maybe this is acceptable for this industry these days. Won't be getting another $10 from me though."
"An obvious upgrade to swap out a year and a half year battery, but no noticeable difference from the stock one when you first get it.  At the time this was cheaper and i would buy again."
"Unlike every other stand wth this design, this is a cheaply injection molded plastic, not aluminum.  Don't be fooled!"
Thank you
"As a phone user, we all come across the issue of our phones dwindling battery life. On the go, it can be an immense problem if you come to the point of minimal battery life, and you don't have the tool to fix that, especially in emergency circumstances. Car chargers like this are of great help, because they allow you to secure your phone's battery life, while not taking up extensive amounts of space that could obstruct your tasks of shifting gears, etc. The product is very durable and well made, and it is not of cheap material. I highly recommend this for people who are on the go, but have important tasks to complete through phone usage."
"Love these cords!  But they need to make the plug in more narrow. Have to take phone out of its Otter Box to charge with this cord. That's why I only gave 4 stars. It is a very good, sturdy, and thick cord. That's what I love about this. I love the 10 ft length also."
Love it! I have had my first one for almost two years. We use it on a weekly basis and it works great.
Does not work with iphone at all.
It broke within the first 30 days.
"A really nice portable power charger from foxx electronics. I love the size of it, it can fix nicely on my purse or my pocked. A little bit bigger than a regular lipstick sized. Not heavy at all. I have others and are very heavy. It is silver and nice looking.  I love that it brings a build in flashlight. That is a really nice extra. It charges my iPhone 6 plus good. Perfect for emergency I always carry it around specially when I go out shopping or to the park with the kids.  One thing that I didn't like it that it gets really hot. So either mine is defective or they are all like that. But it only happens some times. Either way it charges great. Very useful and easy to carry and use. Works with many electronics .  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion."
So far these cables work well!
"This was so easy to put on and fit my perfect! I have been using it a couple months now and really like it. I have not dropped my phone with it on so I don't know how the protection in that way will be, I'm hopinh good. I had dropped my phone three time before I put this on it. I think maybe it had made my phone easier to grip. Does take up more room in my pocket but that's ok."
Love it!
Real nice n sturdy. My wife really liked it. I did too. Should do the job n keep that $500 phone safe.
Did not fit!
indestructible and will not come off of your belt. fits the galaxy 5 snug and securely
AMAZING PRODUCT! FAST SHIPPING! THANK YOU!
"[[VIDEOID:f8ef8c6c7d56750ad91fb50c6d4ca3c5]] ✏️ Quick thoughts to supplement my video demonstration.<br /><br />I like this cable adapter (converter) because:<br />- There are 3 ports (HDMI, VGA, and DVI) from which I can choose. I've had to carry around three separate adapters before. (actually I have a sweet VGA and HDMI adapter, but I didn't know they also made one that has DVI, like this one. Awesome!)<br />- It works in my MacBook Pro.<br />- The image is beautiful.  No distortion as far as I can tell. (I'd recommend always trying to use the HDMI port)<br />- While it's surprisingly big, it's certainly smaller than three whole converter cables together.<br />- Fits nice and snug into my Macbook Pro and doesn't wiggle out.<br /><br />Note: I was given a sample of this product in exchange for a review and demonstration. Hope this demonstration and test helps!<br /><br />📍 Bottom line: would I recommend this product to one of my friends?<br />👍 Yes, absolutely."
Love it
Only had them for a day but I'm impressed. Way better sound (especially low frequencies) and fit than my old Motorola SD-10s. Battery life seems good at several hours. Haven't tested mic and Siri yet. This is the first pair of Bluetooth headphones that I've owned that actually have any bass. For the price you will not be disappointed.
"Worked okay for the first couple weeks or so. Then the cord started generating noise and static. Wiggling the cord at the 3.5mm end alleviates the noise slightly, but you can still hear it in the background. I really expected a better product from Sony."
Good thing it was so cheap.
"Installed easy, and nice clarity. Very happy. Haven't had any drops on the phone yet to report how well it works."
Received this product for review. Great charger. I really like that it is 6 feet long. Its perfect for laying in bed if you don't have an outlet close to your bed. I noticed it seemed to charge faster than other cords that I have bought off of amazon. Overall I think this is a great prodcut!
"DO NOT BUY THIS. If you own a NORMAL S4 (which I and most people do) this will NOT FIT YOUR PHONE. It took longer than most things to arrive, and it has a gross plastic-y smell to it. AVOID THIS MANUFACTURER. This is the specific product I bought but I have copied this review onto the other kanji cases from the same manufacturer to spread awareness."
"Broke immediately over charging port. Got a new one, broke within 3 days."
great product great price deliverd as promised
"I bought this case awhile back and have used it on and off for several months. I didn't originally intend to buy the mint color, but because it was on-sale and I am a fan of mint colored items, I decided why not. The case itself is very sleek. It looks strong and sturdy, which is something you definitely want for an iPhone. It's incredibly easy to slip onto your phone. You basically just pop it in. There are black rubber grips located around the sides that frame the phone. I believe what's unique about the case (besides the slot that allows you to prop up your phone to watch videos) is that there is a dual layer that supposedly protects your phone better than most other cases.<br /><br />Because this case looks quite firm, I would periodically exchange this case for more stylish and glittery ones. I learned my lesson after I dropped my phone once in a glittery case and had my screen shattered whereas I dropped my phone several times (yikes) in the Obliq case and still had my phone stay in one piece.<br /><br />The kickstand feature of this case is also a big plus. The case comes with a plastic card that you can easily slip into the slot on the back, but any credit card will do. Overall, I really recommend this case because it seems like it has protected my phone FAR better than most other cases."
Excellent
"Damn good little phone. No internet connection which if fine with me. I can wait to get to a computer for that. My favorite feature on this phone is that it beeps when the battery is running low. Calls are clear, texts work great. This is the BEST basic phone I've ever owned and I've owned 4 or 5 since 2008."
"Easy to install, perfect fit, I would recommend this screen saver for everyone."
"UPDATE!<br />---<br />Customer service contacted me and sent a new battery that had no issues. The battery IS compatible and so far has been good. Steller customer service.<br /><br />----<br />I had it for a week. On two occasions, my phone died when it was at 40% charge. Then it gives me an error message when I start charging. This is very unreliable. I am going to send this back."
Not practical! Not what i used to have from spigen! Easily scratchable!
Tk You
"Pretty much the best bang for buck head unit. Feature-wise it goes toe to toe with all the 600-1k head units out there, and I'm not a hardcore audiophile so the quality it gets out of my stock 2005 Tacoma speakers is phenomenal.<br /><br />Do NOT buy that $15 bypass thing for the parking brake. Just take the green wire and tape it to the head unit hahaha. Or I loosened a screw and wrapped the wire around it so it's constantly connected to the body of the HU, which grounds it and now I have video all the time. Saves you the trouble of finding which wire in your car is the parking brake wire and tapping into your factory wiring. This is the video that opened my eyes to this: https://youtu.be/hd0rz3iMrPQ?t=1m27s<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - The menu navigation takes a few min of learning but in general it does make sense and is quite easy<br />  - The customizable color themes means it now matches my interior lights perfectly. EVERYONE asks what the stock radio was like, because it matches factory look so perfectly<br />  - Boot up time is super fast. Pretty much 3-5 sec after ignition til you get audio<br />  - Its bluetooth connectivity with my iphone is even better than my BMW, invoking my phone to start playing music right away. With my BMW I have to pull out my phone and get the music going.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - Wish it was easier to figure out when some features are enabled / disabled. For example the AV In/Out is always grayed out for me until randomly it was enabled. The My Vehicle is still disabled for me. Probably RTFM issue.<br />  - It didn't perfectly fit my double-din dash kit for my Tacoma, even though the kit got rave reviews for perfect fitting. So I'm not sure if this thing is just slightly above double-din or my kit is wonky..."
I like it and it more comfortable
"I really love the look of this case it is slim and smooth, I do worry about losing the gold piece especially on this phone since the pieces are so thin, but so far the case has held its own quite well. Very happy to have been able to sample this case, would recommend."
"Just got this in the mail and am excited to say it perfectly connects my docking station in my Toyota to my Galaxy s5 phone. The loudest volume setting is just a little lower than my normal speakers with just the radio on, but I can play my music now so that's a super minor issue."
Very nice i iwll buy it again.
"Love the phone, the camera is the absolute best!  but it's obvious something is wrong with it, and I'll have to return it. The phone has a glitch that makes it black out in the middle of what I'm doing. My emails don't download, Facebook keeps stopping unexpectedly, and I have to constantly restart it. Pretty annoying for an over $400 phone..."
"I ordered from Fixing_DIY just over two weeks ago. I waited on posting a brief review in order to avoid giving a premature positive review; just in case there were any problems. This has actually been the best screen replacement that I've purchased. No light bleed; Accurate colors; Matte black frame matches my phone; Plus it's responsive. The &#34;wedge/lifting&#34; tool however was pretty flimsy. Easy to switch between the two cases because parts were pre-installed for easy transfer. I ordered overnight shipping and received my package sooner than expected. Two minor nitpicks: the earpiece is too deep into the glass and the USB port has a very snug fit; it's sometimes a slight struggle to put in. Really no big deal, I can still hear people I'm talking to perfectly fine, and I can still charge my phone. Other than that, it's the best screen replacement I've purchased. Buy this item, I recommend it.<br /><br />Update: I dropped the phone on concrete from doorknob height a few days ago and nothing happened to the screen. Just some dings on the frame."
Holster was too big for iPhone 6.
It was too big
"Terrible. Screen protector not even as wide as my note 4 screen, doesn't stick well on the edges."
"Very disappointed, belt clip came off the first day, I was able to snap it back in place and then the pin came out of the clip the next day."
Great looking durable case
"I just got this in the mail today and I really like the case. However, the picture definitely makes it look brighter and more eye-catching than it really is. It still looks great though and matches the picture. Also, it fits my phone perfectly!"
Expect what you pay for. It doesn't last very long
good phone. I bought two for gifts. they are pleased and no problems at all. I am buying one for my self. you will not find a better phone for twice the price
it is cute and durable and I have gotten a lot of positive comments on it<br />my only concern is sometimes the flap gets in the way when I am trying to make a call.
"This case is awesome. I picked up one in yellow and the shade is exactly what was pictured. Feels great in my hand and the rubber wrapping around the front is firmly and snugly on there. I was even able to fit three of my cards in the back: license, debit and school id. Just feels cool to know I don't have to carry a wallet with me when I go to the gym."
"Great case , I love it.  It came way sooner than the expected delivery day.  And it fits my phone perfectly."
"Best mount I've used for A/C vents. I mount the phone to the vent, then just pull the phone with mount and all right out of the vent when I want to use the phone, and push it back into the vent when I start driving.<br />Other mounts have a hook into the vents, but then you're using two hand to unclip the phone, versus one-handed use with this mount."
"Sent me the wrong size, so it didn't fit my phone at all. It was also very flimsy."
"I was excited that this iPhone 5s case came before the time expected, but I'm not too happy about my Beats By Dre headphones not being able to plug into my iPhone 5s due to the bulkiness of the case."
Great for all us narcissistic Americans that think other people want to see pictures of us that we took ourselves at bad angles in poor lighting at events we think are cool. Mates fine and works. Technology is nuts!
allows for cool photos
I love it
not gud
does the job
No protection at all
Cool
This was very cheap. The wire broke within three days. Dont waste your money!
"[[VIDEOID:e15d0a2de938a390e1af79e9fd82c9ad]]I am absolutely in love with this Collen Samsung Galaxy s6 case.  The pictures really don't do this case justice.  This case is made of poly carbonate and plastic and is fused together to make it shock absorbent.  The aluminum sheeting on the back really stands out though, it really has a polished metal look and is very unique.  It was incredibly easy to install yet at the same time you can tell it will keep my Samsung phone safe my breaking.  It also comes with a tempered glass screen.  I will be purchasing all my phone cases from Collen from now on.  The quality is top notch and the price is even better!  I did receive this product as a promotion so that I may provide my honest unbiased review."
Wonderful
"Excellent.  Fits my iPhone 6 perfectly.  I use it while on my sit down mower, and cycling.  Phone does not get wet when I sweat."
"No problem!  I ordered it, got it in a timely fashion and that was all I needed."
Great phone but YouTube app don't work I have to use the browser to watch YouTube
Love it
Great screen protector. Went on easy looks perfect.
The phone was in perfect condition and works like brand new.
The case arrived later than expected. I really like that the case is sleek and not too bulky but the rubberized part is so stiff that it makes it almost impossible to press any of the phones buttons.
"costly, but you get what you pay for. Excellent"
The best solid cables!!
"Did not have a good experience with these. They looked nice and they were comfortable. The problem was the sound quality was inconsistant between both ears and overall not that good.<br />Amazon was great with the return, I ended up paying a little more $39 and getting the Symphonized headphones which are amazing all around and come with a 1 yr warranty."
"The case is of good quality, the screen saver was not, but I didn't need one anyway."
"Very nice stand. Nothing fancy but effective. Is a bit heavy, so chances are it will not fall with the watch :)<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this unit and a price is a plus. Ended up buying 2 of them (black & silver) both are nice."
"It makes the cell phone more bigger in all dimensions. And does not sport a stand at the back. If you keep aside these, in my account, drawbacks the case is a good protection and serves the purpose."
These are absolute junk. Pay whatever extra money and get something that fits your I-pad. By the time you cut these to fit. you have a sharp edge on the sides that catches on everything. Pure and simple trash!!!
I was concerned about this product being flimsy and poorly made just because of how thin it appeared to be. I was wrong! I've had it on my phone for a few months now and it is fantastic! They look so late and not oversized while being adorable at the same time. I purchased the black one and teal as well.
"love the color really like product,"
Grandson loves it
"Love this case! I wanted a very thin case to protect my phone as well as let the beauty of my phone still show through. You can't really tell when this case is on, it's that thin. My phone has fallen 3-4 times tops, from maybe 4 feet high and not a single scratch on my phone. Gets no bubbles when on and helps resist finger marks."
"I haven't heard what someone sounds like while using this, but people I talk to through it say they can't tell that I'm on speakerphone."
Great price for a great product. I was worried about the thickness of a glass screen protector but the beveled edge makes this screen protector a must on all my future phones.
Does what its supposed to. Fitment could be better... but it is pretty inexpensive.
"All the tools given with the product is helpful if you use them carefully.<br /><br />I used a hair drier and it didn't work enough to loosen the glue and i broke the lcd underneath. :(.  I'd suggest to spend some more bucks for heat air gun. The string broke since glue was hard.  They gave a spare string and that's nice.<br /><br />In short,  Good product and clear instructions."
great
the plastic part of the screw breaks easily
"Great case, fits nice and feels high quality"
Love it!  Looks awesome in person!  The extra bulky/size that's added to the phone is itself is justifiable for the added protection.
The blue part was loose it wouldn't attach to the green part.
Works great and got it fast
ok
the material is very cheap
I'm happy with the cable.
The antenna fit my SR5 Toyota pickup 1994.  Thank you.
Great little radios. Work like a charm over short distances. Don't believe a half mile range though.
I added these to my iPhone EarPods for running and they work great!  Sound quality is better and EarPods have a better fit. Before you spend a bunch of money on another set water resistant headphones give these a try.
"i wish these were a bit longer, i found one at Tuesday mornings that is 6 ft"
Nice case for showing off your iPhone.  I use it to protect the skin I adhered to the bs I of my phone
Huge bulls fan it fits good ! I love it !!
"The battery arrived dead and won't charge - there's an 'X' over the icon at startup.<br /><br />An RMA was issued pretty promptly, but waiting on results."
"[[VIDEOID:57a84e2a3e8a6fd0ed22eb92157a6ddd]] I have a lot of 3- and 6-feet microUSB cables, but this is my only short cable.  And surprisingly, I use it more than the other cables now.  Having less length helps avoid tangles and enables for easy plugging.  In my video review, I show exactly how this cable looks and works.  For more details, see the video.  If this video was helpful, please click on 'yes' below.  Happy shopping!"
Fits better that my lifeproof
Still on the windshield after a few months.
"all directions in Chinese. could not use it,waste of money!!!"
"I travel a LOT by car and start out behind the &#34;Redwood Curtain&#34; in Eureka, California where cell service is spotty at best.  Wherever I go the routes all include many many miles of limited service. Since installing this device I have had strong cell coverage in even the most remote areas with no more than a few miles of occasional loss of service."
Easy to install and stays put pretty well. Hairline scratches are unavoidable thought.
I've only owned this a short while. I've never dropped this or been rough with my case. The top corner broke off this morning. It didn't catch on anything. I am surprised how flimsy the plastic case is. Do not waste your money.
Great buy and would definitely recommend to anyone. It's up to google to work on improving the OS in adroid wear so we can continue to enjoy this project.
great!
"I feel so much better since I started using this product. Specifically I have more energy am generally in higher spirits, and just feel better."
"Got this as a birthday gift, my friend loved it. Quick charging time which is a big plus"
Sweet!

"My mom has been using this case every day for a while now and figured it's nice to leave a review. The phone fits very securely into the open-style case, even though it looks very flimsy it holds up well. It looks girly enough for her and she has no qualms about it when I asked."
Very easy to use and handy device! VERY happy.
"I bought my daughter this phone case and she loves it! It is very cute and made well but it is a little heavy, other than that it is great!"
love it really nice
Very nice for the price.
It was Grate!!!!
Works well. Bettter quality than you find at the discount stores.
"Very good product, recommended 100%"
"Amazing!  The case it very sturdy feeling right off the bat.  The screen protectors go right on beautifully and easily, and the case has incredible fit and finish. The case removes the issue of the phone being too slippery as well. This is probably the best case that I've used in 10 years of running smart phones. The note 5 is a great phone that deserves a great case. Excellent value."
Item arrived after expected date. The item is cheaply made not worth the long wait that it takes to get to you. I have no idea if it is actually water proof because I'm not willing to take the chance and test it. Buy at your own risk.
I have been Using this product for a week.<br />--Installation is easy.<br />--Screen response is perfect.<br />--No Bubbles.<br />--Customer service is great.
ok
"This buds are great if you don't move around. I talk on the phone with them and when I put my phone in my pocket, the line gets full of static. It doesn't matter what shorts I wear or if I'm inside or outside. If you just want to listen to music they do the job."
"Very quick delivery, after initial charge it seemed to lose its battery faster than I thought while a co-worker charged her phone. Looking forward to the backup power tho!"
Can't really find a place on the steering wheel where you can secure it and have range of motion of the wheel
Nice cover that fits good. Only drawback is that it does not cover the top and bottom sides.
Thought the case would be white and black but still glow in the dark.  It ended up being a really gross white yellowish color.
Great screen protector but was confused about how to install.  Had to you tube an instructional video.  Otherwise it works perfect.
"I love this wallet case. I like the fact it is two pieces and I can detach my phone easily to take photos. Great feature. I also like the look and feel of the case, very professional appearance. Excellent overall!"
There is just one word to describe this product -&#34;Terrible&#34;
Nice looking case.  It has a very smooth surface which has caused me to nearly drop my phone a couple of times.  I don't use the stand as often as I thought I would.
"Did not work well, kept forgetting to request return now stuck with it, do not buy this"
"Has two slots for cards. At first seemed right fit but loosened and was easier to slide in cards later on, Also with money. Magnet hold it close pretty well as long as not too full. Great quality made, fits the phone perfectly. Didn't use stand much but works, just have to adjust at times."
Great case and works flawlessly with the olloclip lenses
Good
"The product is OK, but it squeezes against my ears so tight that I cannot wear it for more than 10 minutes.  Not a good design.  Don't buy this headset unless you have a tiny head."
"This case was very pretty and very functional.  It seemed to be very well made.  However the first night I got it,  I had to take my phone out of the case to charge it.  I was very disappointed in that.  I tried all three chargers and it would not charged in the case.  Had I been able to charge my phone while it was in the case I would of kept it.  Unfortunately I could not so I had to send it back."
Not sure why I didn't read the review this time! Does not work!!!! Now I have to deal with returns. 
"Loose connections, flimsy quality. Charger continues to drop out."
"[[VIDEOID:d900b5fc95ff333f5d63a0e92681ff04]]I brought this for navigating through roads without the need to constantly hold the phone in my hands. I have been using this for 4 days and this is a great product.<br /><br />- The materials used for manufacturing the device are good quality, solid and sturdy.<br />- Set up is very easy, attach the holder to the clamp provided and just push the suction cup on any flat surface.<br />- The suction cup is good quality and holds the device and the phone well.<br />- The device doesn't shake much when hooked in the car. The device holds the phone very well.<br />- The holder can be adjusted to any angle.<br />- The arm of the clamp also can be adjust to any angle.<br />- It can hold devices unto iPhone 6.<br /><br />Very happy with the purchase and would recommend buying this.<br />Disclaimer : I received the product for my honest review."
Not for the phone but was able to make it work
Thinnest case I've ever had! Literally impossibly thin!!!! Great job! Just make it a little more durable with adding as little bulk as possible.
Perfect fit for the back pocket on a pair of standard men's Levis jeans! Stick one of these in your pockets when you're out and about and traveling and put your cell phone in the other pocket and you're now walking around with more than twice the battery capacity you had before. If your phone is slim enough this charger pack will even fit in your pocket so you can charge on the go.<br /><br />There are a lot of cheaper products out there but this one is definitely the thinnest and lightest one for the price point.
Work great
very good..fits well
love this product. Protected my phone for 2 years without peeling off. Had to change my phone and this is the first thing I bought for it. Must have!
"This cover was for my mothers phone, we loved it...  :)"
"I received this as a free review sample. I've probably reviewed (and then donated) two dozen selfie sticks and after a while most start looking alike.<br /><br />This one has some subtle differences. First, the 3.5mm power jack is a feature that appeals to me. As long as your phone has power you can use this stick. I cannot overemphasize how nice it is to not worry about whether the stick is charged up or not.<br /><br />The second 'improvement' that I like on this one is the ribbed grip. Some selfie sticks have smooth grips that are difficult to hold when they are wet. That brings me to the fact that I have used this one in light rain with no issues.<br /><br />My Note 3 phone is firmly held by the gripping mechanism, so it can accommodate larger phones. There is still a little extra that indicates that it could also hold a Note 4 or 5, or an iPhone 6.<br /><br />To be perfectly honest the mirror feature does not excite me. I can see the value if you want to take selfies using your phone's main camera, but for me using the self-side is more than sufficient.<br /><br />Overall, the design is the same, common selfie stick with some nice improvements. For me the biggest one is the ability to power this stick from my phone instead of worrying about a separate charging cycle. You may not be that excited about that feature, but if you do this stick may be all you need."
"I bought these for traveling on the bus to keep people from talking to me.  It worked.  I also have issues with ear buds staying in my ear.  These stayed on my head nicely.  The sound is quite good.  The buttons are solid.  I give it 4 stars because the power button takes some getting used to.  Otherwise, you can't beat a great pair of headphones for this price."
Quality and performance is tip top. Keep striving for better Anker!
just what i needed
Works great. Everything needed to replace the charging port cover
"They're Awesome!,.I like the style & they're comfortable..Definitely worth the price."
"This is a good case for the price.  I needed something fast to protect my phone.  Since there weren't many options for the leather back LG G4, I grabbed this until I found something nicer.  It has held up nicely.  Also it has a stand that snaps into place and holds tight."
"If you're in doubt to purchase this, don't be! Order it!  I had my iPhone 6+ mounted on my motorcycle - it happened to pop out of the holder it was in, while I was moving.  I guess it was the vibration.  Irregardless, it landed on concrete in the middle of a busy intersection. After turning around to go retrieve it, I watched it being driven over by 4 cars.  There is not one scratch on my phone.  The screen did not break/crack.  I was so relieved when I got it back - words cannot describe."
Broke within 3 weeks.  the actual metal piece that attached to your phone came out as if it wasn't even attached in the first place.<br /><br />I have never seen one break that way.  It just came out in its entirety.
Mounted easily to trolling motor. Crystal clear display on my fish finder with no distortion from trolling motor.
"Provides good protection with a nice appearance. On/off button on case is a little stiff, however, does prevent accidental  switching on of phone."
Love it
works well... does get a little weird if I have my phone in my right leg pocket and bluetooth in my left ear... I really like the fact it tells you when the battery is low! I have had some that just went dead without warning..
The band really inhanced the look of my stainless watch.
This case is exactly what I wanted and good quality.
As advertised
It's best cable ever I bought. You will never disappoint from it. I will buy it whenever I need.
Fits nice a snug on my galaxy s4. I have had it a couple months and it's alot better than I expected.
I love this so much. It makes using my GPS on my phone so much easier. Also if I need to call someone I can put the call on speaker phone and this will hold my phone leaving my hands free to drive.
I use it a lot. It's light weight and easy to store.
The only thing this watch is missing is a heart rate monitor. Otherwise I love it!
Great case and fits amazing looks great to. Very fast shipping
"Worked well while it lasted on my iPhone 6s, but the rubber &#34;fingers&#34; that wedge into the vents broke off after a couple weeks. Disappointing."
Bought two of these and so far so good. Had to get one replaced but Anker resolved my issue very quickly! Hopefully they last which is the hope for ANY brand of lightning cable..
The lips and lipstick broke the same day. I tried to glue it but was unsuccessful.
This an amazing case! Best iPhone case out there. You can't beat the price and this case is much better then another life proof case because this case actually works I just love it!!!
great itim
This unit was everything i expected plus alittle more.
These units are very well made and I was pleased that they were packed in a loop/ring as to not be all tangled together.  Very nice and so far holding up well. Colors are good also and do come in handy.
"It arrived quickly, as expected and was exactly what we were needing."
Great product
"I had some shipping problems so I just reiceived it yesteday. The phone turn on the first time and worked fine, but today it just shut down. Im conecting it to the wall charger, but its dead."
"These work fine in USB 2.0 and in chargers but not in high speed USB 3.0 ports. Otherwise they are fine. They should just advertise them as not working in 3.0 and I'd rate them five. I had that issue when I first got them, contacted the seller and he sent me another batch which was nice but they have the same limitation which is no problem at all if you know about it. They will buzz and cycle on and off in USB 3.0 (the ports with blue inside and generally on the front of Dell XPS workstations) they work fine on all the others and with all the chargers I tried.<br />A major plus is they have small Apple style ends that work with Otterbox and LifeProof cases. With many cables, you have to take the case off. Imagine buying your son an expensive LifeProof case that he has to take off to use a different aftermarket cable with a stubbing end, only to have the iPhone fall into a fish tank! No, I'm not making that one up."
"Nice band, great addition to my collection."
"I think this has been certified by Apple, that's why it's unique. Really like it."
"Really great case, i've already had a couple close calls and its saved my phone every time. The built in screen protector is responsive as well. The case looks great and does its job perfectly."
Good product
very good case for the money and wears well so far.  It also has a funky pattern on the back side!!
"It looks nice, but does not charge when my cell is on."
Stopped working after a little over a month of usage... Mainly used to Listen to music only... Manufacturer please contact me... Very unhappy since I can no longer output any volume out
works so well
Good product
Great!  Now I don't need to switch out different charging cords in the car.
No protection. Only good when your trying to watch movies at work.
"UPDATE 3/31/17: This phone turned out to be refurbished, not new.  Also became a total dud, cannot recommend it after all.  First of all, we found out it was a rooted device and no efforts to fix that could ever get the phone to update.  Then the touchscreen had issues.  Finally, after 18 months (and out of warranty, of course!), the phone simply stopped booting up one day.  It would only cycle the LG logo over and over.  I sent it to LG based on their instructions, who knew it was out of warranty but were supposed to let me know how much to fix it.  Instead, LG just sent it back to me with this note:  &#34;ESN Blocked. Aftermarket alteration to phone voids warranty. ESN and color of phone do not match. Refurbished unit or non LG label.&#34;  Total surprise to us as we thought we were purchasing a brand new LG phone based on the vendor's description.  We have replaced this with a Motorola G4 and hope to have better results all around.  Buyer beware!<br /><br />PRIOR REVIEW: This was purchased as a gift for my son's 14th birthday and for starting freshman year in high school. It was factory sealed, perfect condition.  We got him an otter case to protect from oopsies. He's very happy with the phone, especially loves the bigger screen, battery's long life, the quality camera. He's in marching band and his phone is his lifeline to keeping up with his schedule and communications with band friends.  We had to have the AT&T store fix the access point (we use GoPhone) to use the data plan, but now all is working fine. This phone will probably pass down to his brother or me down the road."
The fit is great and does a wonderful job at protecting my phone. What I don't care for is how it makes pushing the volume and power button difficult.
Piece of crap. Didn't even fit my phone and the back fell out of it. Guess that's what you get for only spending 5 bucks
This case has saved my phone!
Terrible! I can't get the cord to uncoil and sit right when I wear them. I have adjusted the buds to try and fit my ears but they just don't fit. They fall out when I'm running and I have to charge it before every workout. The battery life is awful.
"very nice case, fits my nuvi65 very well, completely satisfied"
As expected.
"Does the trick, but feels cheap."
"Easy to place and microphone easily. We have I phone 6, note 3 and note edge it fit all 3. Held onto phone during drive and you can angle it fo better viewing. The really nice part is it can be easily moved to where you need it instead of being stuck to the dash like a p previous one."
Thank you
I love it. Exactly how I expected.
I bought a pair of these at Target for $100 as a gift for a friends birthday.  I liked them so much I bought my own pair.
does the trick I like it time will tell
Excelent
Wrong super shieldz.
had the same case for my note 3 and still love it. as a now iphone user I was so worried about it breaking yet the day I put the case on I dropped it yet nothing happened. couldnt be happier with the purchase
Wouln't work with charge
I love it...
The case didn't fit the phone properly and the buttons didn't line up. Waste of money.
"Wanted it to plug into my Mother's TV and drive  Bluetooth speaker that I could set next to her chair (she's quite hard of hearing).  Took many times to pair, but it eventually did and now have a remote, wireless speaker where she can hear the TV right at her ear (she refused headphones, so this is good).  Just wished the device came with a USB charger, so I had to buy a wall wart to keep it powered."

"This phone is no good.  The screen goes off and on, and it is not even a year old.  Don't be selling phones to customers that wouldn't even last a year.  Besides, the screen goes blank every time."
Stylus was great but there was NO INK in the pens :-(
I was pleasantly surprised with this band! I expected it to be cheap because the price was really wonderful compared to some others. But it does not feel cheap at all! It also is a very nice size for my tiny wrist.  I was always disappointed with my original Apple Sport band because it was so bulky and heavy. This is an AMAZING upgrade. I plan to buy a few others in different colors.
I purchased this for my daughter it takes the entire day to fully charge her ipad.
Love it
Really Nice
"This has been a lifesaver for me, as I carry it with me in my backpack all the time.  The only thing I would suggest to the company is to find a way to make the recharging time a little shorter.  It takes all night to charge this battery. It was an awesome buy though.  And having a flashlight with me has came in handy a couple  of times.  I would also suggest to anyone buying a external battery to buy a big one (min of 10,000 mAh) because even if you forget to charge it will last 4-5 times of charging a large cell phone battery."
"Bought this after my old headphones broke, WORST SOUND EVER! They arrived as I was going to the gym opened them there and paired them to my phone with no problem but the sound totally ruined my work out. It is awful, like if  you were listening from a cardboard box. Don't waste you money I ended up sending them back the next day."
"Im sure its a good item, but it does not look good on the 6 edge. The sides are open and the borders catch a lot of dirt. Not so good for this phone."
Fall apart and break on the micro usb side. Do not buy this brand.
Four stars
Extremely nice case! The build quality is excellent and the feel is superb. Truly a nice case.
"At first I was really impressed by this screen protector. It goes on very smoothly and leaves no bubbles. However, after the fifth day my phone slipped off the couch and fell (about 1 foot) on the linoleum floor, and the screen cover shattered. Is it true that there's a lifetime warranty on the screen cover as some other people had posted?  I thought this was what the screen protectors are made for."
Excellent product and Seller<br />Perfect fit easy to apply
Great
"Excellent product, good range, excellent service."
"I typically buy only tech armor products when it comes to screen protectors for my electric devices, but I am very disappointed with this one it does not fit the phone it only covers the screen not the entire front of the phone like it should. Also it is just about a millimeter off from the screen so it doesn't completely even cover that! I will definitely not be purchasing more from them!"
"The band 42mm hold up clearly with my apple watch, this pc is a little larger than the apple watch band but it looks good and fit very well,and the package coming with a link remover if necessory . Let me first say that I do like this quite a bit despite my first experience. This is the second pc I bought to my father. Once you get it fitted, you will fall in love with the look, weight, and feel of this band. The material is strong and sturdy. The finish is beautiful and by no means flashy."
"I always put a screen protector on my cell phone as soon as I get it. I like this one very much. I use a swype type keyboard and this helps to let my finger glide over screen very fast. You really can't notice it's there. If you follow directions, it's very easy to install this. In my case I had the screen protector before my new phone arrived. I highly recommend this. I know so many people with scratched or cracked screens and I'm doing what I can to not be one of them."
"Late delivery, but as advertised."
Very Nice headphones for the school
as expected
I love it great product....
This was a gift for our granddaughter ....she loves it.
Not all that exciting
"I Wana write a review for wizard because I ordered four order of these cell phone holder/car mount. I'm using wiz Heart because it is functional, simple, and easy to I install.<br /> I'm gonna order some more for friends. Great job!"
This is my 2 koolkase and I absolutely love them! They fit my phone perfect and look exactly like the picture! I won't use anything else from now on.
"This battery is excellent. It works perfectly like the original battery, more than 8 hours without charger and full use.<br />I recommend it, Great purchase!<br /><br />Sorry for my poor english. Im from Venezuela!<br /><br />Grettings for all!"
"great kit. I bought both the Metra and Schoche kits. Although the Metra kit had better plastic, the Scosche kit fit much better and allowed the head unit to come further forward. overall satisfactory for the price."
These chargers didn't last a month. They stopped working.  Very poor quality.
Perfectly clear... fit beautifully on 6th gen iPod.  Letting the Gold Shine On!!  :0)
"LOVE this case! Hated my Lifeproof case for the 6 Plus-I couldn't hear or be heard, unlike with my Lifeproof for iPhone 5. Love this Merit case & for a fraction of the price of the Lifeproof case."
Case went on with ease. Very good looking case feels very durable I definitely recommend this case.
Perfect
"the piece of junk arrived today. it flashed, popped and went off and on for several minutes. then it settled down with one led dead, one barely lit and 3 that randomly have convulsions of dim, off or super bright. This THING never worked properly or was even tested before you shipped it. I hope Amazon will drop your sorry ass as a pitiful vendor. WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO????????? as for those potential suckers who are considering ordering this thing I suggest you RUN AWAY AND NOT JUST WALK AWAY!!!!!!"
Great product!! Looks great and is WAYYYYYY better then the stock radio I had in my 01 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Makes the sound so much better. Shipping was fast and over all glad I made the purchase!
Love it
Best charger out there. Nice size and great value!
"Otter Box makes great cases even though they are expensive. However i have noticed that if not used with the holster the rubber slip cover will stretch out relatively fast. In the case of this one, it took only 4 months. The one i had for my S4 lasted about 10 months. The Real Tree cases sold by Otter Box seem to have a better rubber cover than the standard Otter Box. That case lasted over 1.5 years, without any sign of wear and tear, until i got a new phone. The cost of the Real Tree case was $15-$20 cheaper but was a better product. I do not recommend these products anymore and have moved a better maker called Kecko."
excellent
Very pleased with the battery.
"Awful. Hard to get on,  doesn't protect. Waste of money"
Received item and what a piece of crap. The image on the back is all blurry... looks like it was poorly laser scanned on there or something. The case does NOT fit the phone properly. What a waste of money.
did no work on my GPS
"I ordered this on the 19th, and the estimated arrival date was September 14th-30th.<br />It came almost a month early.<br />(TODAY.)<br /><br />I got a white and yellow one, and it fits my iPod with its fat, bulky, silicone case.<br />I needed to use a TEENSY bit of force to get it in there, but its perfectly fine.<br /><br />If I had to order it again, I would."
Use it on a Honda CRF 250 L and it worsk perfectly. Holds my Garmin Montana very tight.  Also holds my iPhone 6.
The cables are poorly constructed and fell apart on first use
Good
Great product<br />Powerful flash light<br />Quick charger for iPhone<br />Very portable
"I wish the bottom and top edges were a little more rigid, but the case works great. Fits great and very slim."
This cable is poor very poor quality cheap made
...trash 😡
I love it and it came in the mail fast and I was just so happy an d yes it was amazing
Really solid.  Love the look.  Quality product.
Very good product.
"Two issues: took outta package and amazed that this case is all metal-no inner liner of any kind: metal. Put on because it was such a pretty red! Setting it down to charge on couch; slips and falls off. Took it to a store last night and was clutching it so I wouldn't drop it-it's so slippery. So upset about that so I bought a new case right in the store. Out to car; trying to get this pretty red piece of metal off my phone: ouch, pinched fingers! Worried if it would scratch my mint condition iPhone 6+.<br />This is a gorgeous case- that's the only positive going for it.<br />Way too slippery, no protection inside the case, easy to drop, hard to get off. On top of that, I was told I cannot return it. Unsure why- bad product- I sure wouldn't want to drop my phone with this case on..."
Great! Love it!
Excellent stylus - my favorite
Is very good looking so nice good quality of phone case thank you
"Looking at this device as insurance, I see its appeal, having lost keys a few days ago for the first time in years and losing many hours in hopes of finding them, only for my daughter to find them by accident. This device lasts only about a year and cannot be recharged; the company offers a recycling opportunity that includes buying new devices at discount. I found the fob itself a bit bulky and doubt how useful it would be to attach to everyday devices such as remote controls. However, the idea of throwing one into one's luggage and/or backpack appeals to me, and it would certainly be a smart investment for one who tends to misplace particular items a lot. It works as advertised, as well. Just don't look at it as a one-time purchase. It isn't."
it was not what I expected the top wiring was the incorrect one. I'm look to send it back not a good product .
"Holds strong on the dash, and shows no signs of coming off when hitting bumps in the road. I've been using this for over a year now and it works as intended. Great to be able to adjust the view in both portrait and landscape mode when using the phone for navigation.<br /><br />Great product. Ships fast and works as intended. 5 stars."
"While the slide back and forth from each country or plug can be awkward from time to time, this is a great practical tool to bring along overseas.  Love that it has two USB ports and one plug.  If you have Apple products, the USB ports can sometimes be in competition.  This is a problem that I've identified with other adaptors, so not necessarily an issue with this product.  We ordered two and made daily use of them."
Excellent accessory.
"Phenomenal little set for the money. Has been used countless times in the short two weeks I have had it. A must have for anyone who tinkers or just owns cell phones, glasses, or smaller objects in general"
"I got the case fairly quickly, and I like it very much. In some other cases that I have ordered the colors are much less bright in person, but my case is perfect! It's rubber, not a hard case, which I prefer as it offers more protection for the phone. I've only had it for a week or so but I am very happy."
"It works better than the glass screen protector I had bought before this.  It is easy to place and is invisible to the eye once in,  plus they give you 3 screens. A great deal."
"my husband is always losing his wallet, so I did some research and ordered this for him. It has many great reviews. Since receiving this tracker, he has lost his wallet once and was able to quickly log into his phone and trace its location. Thankfully it wasn't far and he was able to locate it quickly. The device also has a setting that will alert you if your wallet and phone be come separated, which would be GREAT for a night out. Overall, I recommend this gadget to anyone who misplaces their wallet regularly. It's a tad bulky, but totally worth it."
"Love this!! Great product, just what I needed"
"I originally bought an otter box case for my new phone at best buy,  but was disappointed by the bulky design.  Saw this one online for about a fourth of the price & I absolutely love it!  Nice rubber grip, sharp looking and kickstand is great! Plastic corners offer protection from drops. Thanks!"
"This is the best charger I've ever used. I'm surprised how much enthusiasm I can have for a car charger, but this little charger is seriously great. It charges faster than any charger (car or wall) that I've ever used. I can run Pandora over Bluetooth and have Google Maps running when I'm driving, and the phone will still get to 100% charge by the time I get where I'm going."
"I have my case for 5 months now, so I am able to truly share my thoughts.  When I first received it I loved it, it worked well, I did not mind the additional cable, but it was short and inconvenient.  It looked nice, and at first I did not mind the extra weight, but now I only use it for occasional use. The weight if too much for my pocket at work, the size of the phone itself is of course larger but the case just adds too much weight and additional size.  I find it does not charge my phone as well as it did when new. The case is also slick, and I would have prefer a backing with some texture or silicone to prevent sliding and slipping.  I can see this case would work better for a smaller phone even the iphone 6, just not the plus.  I you do not carry your phone in your uniform pocket, and have trouble recharging , then you may be please with this case. I have over time found it just not meet my needs."
The connection for the micro usb gets loose and makes it hard to charge. I've had it for about a month and have had issues. I've purchase be usb cables a d have the same issue.  there have been a couple of times I wake up and my phone is not charging. If you do get a full charge it will last pretty much all day
"My son loves this. It's not much bigger than the phone itself, so it's not bulky and he loves the kickstand feature."
Sturdy. Holding up well.
I love it
"It is ok, except I have to restrap it everytime.  Other than that is excellent.  The strap is not big enough to strap around my bicep, but fits the forearm."
Love it!!!! And it came with a free stylus!!!! It was fast shipping.<br /><br />Pros: fits the iPhone 6+ perfectly.<br />Has a clip to slip it on your belt or pocket<br />And has belt loops so you can more securely attach it to your belt.<br /><br />Cons: nothing wrong wit case. But it is BIG ( but that's Apples fault) 😁<br /><br />I received this product for a fair review.
"I've been using this case for a year and a half now. I will use slim armor on every phone from here on out. It is the perfect size for my hand (adult male) and it's taken a beating but still looks and works great.<br /><br />The fit was perfect for my LG G2. No issues with speaker quality or camera quality with my case on.<br /><br />The double layer case provides a lot of protection. I've dropped my phone several times (from desks, from my pocket, from my ear)...no damage. The case is hardly even scratched after a year an a half of use. The color hasn't even started to fade or wear and all the plastic pieces still fit tight.<br /><br />I take the case off and clean my phone and the case fairly often but not a lot of dirt is allowed behind my phone with this case on (less than other cases I've had).<br /><br />I'm not sure if Slim Armor was available for my other smart phones in the past but I'll make sure it is in the future."
Just save your money and go ahead and order a real life proof case. On the first day the selector switch to turn the phone on vibrate stripped out. And the speaker on top doesn't line up with the hole that was made.
Good quality and good timing of shipping
Great Product!!! fast Shipping!!
Love it
"This cable works better than my wall charger.<br /><br />Once the cable gets plugged into the car charger, it's very hard to get out. I don't mean it's impossible. I mean to say it's PRETTY FIRM<br /><br />The material itself is plastic. It looks like any other charger but once you plug everything, you feel the difference. It's worth of your money.<br /><br />Also, if you get the cable and connect to your wall charger, it's gonna work just as fine"
"Exactly as described. Quick to send out, very reasonable price."
They are great
the gps103b is not working as an alarm. it is responding to sms request but not  to key fob or any input from sensors.
"these do what they are supposed to.  I liked their older product with the clipping leash better, but they aren't making them any more.  So far, okay for what it does!"
great buy super fast shipping a+++
"I've had this product since March. It did work fine until now. I never had enough time to post my updated feedback but, this charger will not stay inside my phone. If i charge my phone for the night, and if it &#34;oh so suddenly&#34; pops out while I'm sleeping my phone will be on 30% or something.  This problem has been occurring for the past month. I haven't contacted the seller yet, so I'll see how that goes."
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
I love it great case.
Sounded great for about 3 weeks then broke!
I really like the case it fits my phone perfectly.
love it
Wow
I highly recommend this.
great case
Great item
"This is a great and affordable case! I have kept one of these on my phone since my $50 Otter Box only lasted a few months before breaking. I am working on my second case since the first one only lasted a few months before it needed to be replaced. I would highly recommend giving it a try, replacing a $9 case after 4 months is so much better than replacing a $50 one. It will not last forever, but you will get your money out of it and it protects your phone great. My phone has been dropped countless times and held up. My advice is to keep only one card per slot to not stretch out the slots. That is what keeps happening to mine."
"Looks exactly like the picture, comes with lanyard. Tested with paper towels and other various paper items. Works just fine. Just be sure to completely close the top."
Works great!
"Fit well and looks very nice.  It's very thin, so may not protect iPhone well, especially when it's dropped.  But I know it before I purchased it, so not complaining."
Great.
"I bought this set on Amazon July 10, 2015 and went dead August 24 2015. I went to see if i could return it but read that it was too late to return. I was very disappointed with this product and Amazon should keep away from this type of product. Don't waste your money. It worth less than a star."
Pretty color with adequate protection
very useful
Cheaply made
I didn't get a Bluetooth remote to take a picture with my selfie stick. So now I just have a selfie stick but no way to take the picture.
Unu's super pack was given to me for review purposes and I believe they make some of the best products especially for the iPhone and iPad. This little external charger is great for anyone on the go and doesn't have access to an outlet to plug in the phone. Right after receiving the super pack I noticed that my phone battery was low. Down to 20% so I plugged it in because it came charged up and ready for use. I was able to get 1 full charge within less than 30mins. This thing charges your device quickly and is smart enough to know when your phone is fully charged and stop charging.  I love the fact there is a push button switch to turn it on and off and led lights to show you how much battery is left in the charger. I will be bringing this external 5000mah battery pack with me everywhere I go just because of it shear size.<br /><br />UNU has always made great products and this one doesn't fall short. It is one of the best external chargers I have use. Better than morphie or any other knock off brand. I will be recommending this to anyone who is always on the go because it's small enough to place in your pocket.
Pretty & Sparkly
"Awesome!!  Makes for a nice, dressy bracelet at weddings."
"Bought this for my fiancé to use because he's always running down his batter, travels, etc. He loves it & doesn't go anywhere without it."
It is working as promised. My only complaint would be that the buttons aren't labeled (like flashlight and lighter). There are just 3 identical buttons in a row and I have to keep referencing the instructions if I don't use it often. But overall I'm very pleased.
Works great
"Really cute case, but it was super cheap looking, and it would not close correctly. Definitely would not stay on phone and/or protect it."
Durable
"I was looking into Bluetooth earbuds and these had good ratings.  In fact, nothing negative.  Which is very unusual. And all of the reviews were very brief, and most included shipping and packing accolades.<br /><br />I was suspicious of all of these 5 star ratings so I took a look at the majority of the reviewers.  Low and behold, it's amazing the vast majority never posted before the date of their review.<br /><br />In what I suspect to be a means to add legitimacy to their reviews, some have two or three items listed, however they are reviewed on the same date as their review for this product.<br /><br />And what really leads me to suspect most of these are bogus reviewers many of them have purchased the exact items.  Sorry, too much of a coincidence for me."
Yes the camera is good quality and work perfect. Now problem with installation fet perfectly as the factory on.l recommend it for everyone looking for galaxy s4 replacement.
Feel like a cheap item and does work.
A slight difference of performance but my iPhone works better now
Very misleading description. Plus it was overpriced. I found one similar on ebay for much less and of better quality.
scratches too easily . I'm on my second in two months and I'm not a over user.
Love it! Ordering additional colors I liked it so much.
"I love my new phone holder, I bought an old car to leave at my vacation home so the holder is a perfect enhancement...Holds my iPhone 6 plus perfect...Very happy...Thank you!"
"Its works great. Stay in place, doesnt come lose in time."
"Very cute case, I loved its protection . The only thing I didn't like is the charger doesn't fit in the phone with the case on."
Great case! My heart rate monitor has had a long life since I bought this case for the watch and the monitor strap.
"I was able to purchase this at a discount for an honest review.  I needed a charger at work that was as fast as my home charger.  This is just as fast, and it shows up on my phone as &#34;Fast Charging&#34;.  So, it is charging more than twice as fast as a regular charger.  This is key since I am always on the move, and can only charge for small periods at a time.  I am VERY happy with this charger set."
Awesome product...
"the tolerances for this are horrible, this is the cheapest life proof knock off i have ever seen<br />don't waste your time getting this"
"This is a great charger. I like that it has a well placed light to tell you if it's charging. This charger is a great color of purpley-red to add a little fun to your accessories. This color makes it certain that my husband and sons will not pick my charger up and take off with it! I've had no problem with this charger. We own several vehicles, and I got tired of forgetting to grab a charger from another vehicle or not realizing I didn't have one until my phone beeped that it was dying. Because of this I decided I was getting chargers for every vehicle."
Complete garbage!! Can't someone make a screen protector without having to spray some liquid on it and make it look like crap?? Waste of $$
"I love this case!  High quality materials, very slim, looks great!  As good, if not better than Otterbox Symmetry.  If you can't guess by now, I highly recommend this case."
Love this product !!!!!<br />I brought two and they match my phone .
Loving this case.  Super easy to put on or remove and has protected my phone from various drops of 3ft+
Used it for my studio LTE 5.0 had to make modifications on buttons and charge port.cut new opening for charge port and widened volume button hole on the hard case.works great now
i had issues with the headset but global box made it right with me. nice to have a company care about my experience with a product.
"I wanted to love this cable, but it stopped working within a month. The cable it replaced (different brand) is frayed but still works. This K-ble charger is completely in tact but won't charge my phone anymore. Disappointing and a waste of money. Maybe I just got a bad one. Hopefully others will have better luck."
Great quality product. Does not protect screen much but it a slim cover.
"[[VIDEOID:878adf1360dc96064c2774c3adaef4dc]] So your looking for a charging dock for your desk or office but your not too sure if this is the one for you?<br /><br />Watch in HD here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6ve_X3SOMk<br /><br />I was sent this sample from G-Hub Amazon UK for an honest review.<br /><br />If you don't have an iOS device but instead an Android, Windows or Blackberry smartphone this dock is also compatible.<br /><br />What's great about this product<br />Stylish and solid build<br />Charge the Apple iPhone & Watch at the same time<br />Great for looking at apps/notifications or watching movies while on your laptop/desktop<br /><br />If you have an Apple Watch you can attach the magnetic charger to the dock, otherwise you will need to use your own charging cable for your smartphone.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it to all."
Works great
Very good
Much more than expected.  Sound volume and quality is outstanding
Awesome!
as expected
It last me a few days
Good product.
Works perfectly!! It charged my phone from 1% to 93% in 40 minutes.
"love the see thru slot for id, love the feel of the case, getting lot of comments, love the closing tab and the phone case holder in the case."
"Been using this with no real issues, stays in place, very simple and works as expected.  Only downside is the phone (iPhone 5s with very light case) tends so slope down from the weight.  But still works fantastic in my car setup.  Purchased a 2nd one for my wife."
"This is a great idea for anyone that has multiple devices.  We travel quite a lot and it's very convenient carrying one charger.  However, this charger is slow and is best for overnight use.  Great value!"
Such a clean and professional looking case. And holds up extremely well.
Love this case :-)
good for price
I've had it for about 2-3 weeks now & it's still hanging tough. I dropped my phone face down at work and my screen is still fine & the case has the smallest scratch on the top left corner ( barely noticeable ). I enjoy the mini stylus it came with too. Definitely worth 8 bucks.
"This armband is perfect.  I can fit my iPhone 6 in there without having to remove it from the case (unlike other armbands I've tried).  The material is flexible enough to be able to use the buttons from outside, and the clear front still allows me to use the touch screen.  The band is not constrictive when I workout, yet it holds the phone in place perfectly.  I wash it by hand in cool water.  I use the belt to hold my key fob and my sunglasses at the gym."
The best phone case I ever bought!
"The packaging is simple. They don't give you an easy way to apply the protector without touching the sticky side, but I got it on and looks 9/10."
It made me very happy.
Easy to apply and works great.  Have used it for a few months and it has definitely protected my phone.
These are solid. I love the cloth style. I forgot my first one in a hotel room so I got another one. That's how much I love this product. I use it all the time.
LOVE IT!!!
Good timing and great quality
It does what I need it to do.
When I received the product it was just what I was hoping it was going to be. Easy to mount and easy to set how best fits your needs and the part that wrapped around the phone was well cushioned so it won't hurt the phone. Unfortunately after using it on the first day the spring popped out and it will no longer hold my phone so I sent this product back.
Works well. Have taken phone underwater and it works!
"Thought this was going to be a great case but a week in to using it, the plastic that holds he phone in place started to break. Now my phone no longer stays in place."
doesn't have good touch.
very cute
Very easy to install and works well even with a case on the phone
Item was not what was advertised.  Not returning because it will cost me half what I paid plus 20% restocking fee to return it than the refund I would get.  Very cheaply made case with NO dedicated switch to turn it off/on.  No felt lining inside the case either.  I will be selling this and hopefully get what I paid out of it.  Read the product reviews and seller reviews before getting this.  I would not recommend this case.  Would not buy again.
Great case fits perfectly on the phone.
Cute case
Good quality. Great price.
Very nice product very good quality love it I recommend it
Great product
"Nice skin case!<br /><br />This is VERY well made - tight enough not to slip, but not a huge pain to remove to swap batteries.<br /><br />It is far from the thinnest case out there - the Orzly case I have is considerably thinner - but is far from bulky and gives a little more of a sense of security from falls.<br /><br />The seams are smooth and there is just a little bit of a &#34;grippy&#34; feel to it.<br /><br />I recommend this as a solid mid-thickness case, not as unnoticeable as the Orzly, but not as cumbersome as folio or multiple-piece cases."
💯
My husband is happy now that his blue tooth fits right.  So I am happy.
"It's great and a perfect fit for my tablet. The shipping date was not as exact, but the product itself is awesome"
It works
I bought it for my mom and she loves it
great sound. loved it
Was very easy to install and it only took me 3min to put it all together! The packaging was great in very good condition and brand new! I'd recommend this to everyone!!
It's a good charger however there's no charger to charge the case.
10 ft is great. the  braided cord is good. charges faster than what we had.
Excellent product
perfect product and shipped fast.  Thanks!
I love this phone. It is a lot more than I expected in a cell phone. I would recommend it to  anyone that is looking for an excellent cell phone. The battery life if a little on the short side is the only complaint I have.
"Phone says it is not authenic, fake, knock off!"
"I love this case.  At first, it seemed to block the power button on the right side, but the phone and I are new to each other, so maybe I was just doing something wrong.  I have had the case a month now and I put this phone through hell.  The case is PERFECT.  I'm so happy with this purchase.  I only wish there was a way to attach the stylus."
"nice, cheap and best"
It charges just as fast as the OEM Samsung Fast Charger for my Note 4 and the prongs are positioned so they don't take up more than one socket on my surge protector.
well fit
Love
"Awesome way to keep your cell phone safe while riding your bike!<br /><br />This is the only cell phone case for my bike which hasn't broke!! I bought two other types, and both of them broke after only a few weeks.<br /><br />This one uses rubber, and it absorbs the vibrations much better.  This thing is a MUST-HAVE if you ride your bike long distance, or it occasionally drizzles on your ride.  This will keep your phone remarkably dry during a rain, even though it's not 100% waterproof!<br /><br />Great buy!"
I love bb! However I wasn't warned that the phone I was  purchasing had a glitch and  now won't even turn on
"Best money spent. After 2 1/2 years I've had this device. To this day I still say it's best money spent. In time the wear and tear will take its toll. Esspecially if you're like me. I wear it when running, in the gym, or if I take public transportation. I like to hear music in one ear and still be aware of my surroundings.  Be it a person or a vehicle but I'm crossing the street. You may have to replace the rubber band that lies beneath the latex ear bud. If it pops in time. My advice is to order a single pack off of this site. I was so pleased I could just order a new pack of ear buds from Amazon for under $10."
Love the leather - it smell like wonderful leather
Loved it!
"does the job, took it water rafting. Fits fire phone."
Not the best but it does the job if you dont have BT in your ride.
it was great and sounds good.
Fit perfect
A highly affordable and nicely built six port USB power adapter that comes handy all around home and while travelling. Working without any problems so far.
All 3 cables stopped working after 3 weeks of me ordering them.  All I get is error messages and I have tried to contact the seller.  However I have gotten no where.  I will not be buying again nor do I recommend these products to anyone.
It's great the have a 90 degree cable. I love it!
"They're okay cords.  Really great price and nice colors, but much of the time they don't work when charging my iPhone or iPad."
"best screen protector ever way better then the cheap plastic sheets we have all been using I will buy one of these for all my needs (phones ,tablets Ipads )"
The item in question is working just fine<br />Nothing more to be said
Don't fit well in ears
"Works great, feels exactly like the naked the iPhone screen; super smooth and responsive!"
Works perfectly with my Cyberpower laptop.
I like it. Works very well.
Overheats my phone badly.
"Nice fit, good protection and just love it!"
The case worked great  for the first few weeks. The piece you pull down in order for the phone to fit broke. I thought it will be ok because I would be able to line it backup in place but nope. It no longer charges my phone. I paid less than 7.00 for it and that is the amount of use I got out of it.
Went on great.  Bubbles were easy to remove.  The only reason I remove one star is that there's no cut out for the front camera and sensor.
Arrived on time and works great !!!
Quick delivery and met expectations
"Great product, fast shipping!"
"I wanted to transfer pictures, but it did not work.  What I actually needed was a memory card."
i like the product
One of the buds died a few days after buying the product
"I give 5 stars because the performance of this phone is excellent having in consideration the price,LTE,OS lollipop ,fast respons etc.No complaint for battery and camera didn't expected first quality for the price I paid"
"Works just like it should, buttons on the side are a little difficult to push with it on though."
this is genuine genius.
It broke within a week. Will not be ordering from them again.
Works great at a reasonable price
"Work great, price great"
"I was looking forward to this stylish phone purse. Unfortunately, it's one of the cheapest products I've received from Amazon. The wristlet is useless. The strap is attached to the hook instead of the ring, and there's no way to connect it to the purse. One of the hooks on the long strap does not close until it's forced. I doubt it will last long."
Great !!!! I drop my iPhone at work I work in a warehouse and the floor is extremely hard. I was so afraid to pick up my phone when I did I saw the screen was shattered but when I remove my Maxboost glass protected I realized it was the screen protector and not my actual phone. Great product to have if you have an iPhone it's a life saver.
"It's cute at first but the picture gets scratched/worn off too quickly in my opinion. Also, it picks up a blue tint from jeans. Worst of all the case is not even secure on the phone! I dropped my phone once and the case just burst open and the phone flew out and got scratched!!! I buy cases specifically so they can take the brunt of a fall and protect my phone (and its value) and this basically doesn't do anything that it's supposed to!"
good
The overall looked the mount is good. Sleek and easy to use. Definitely holds my iPhone 6. The only problem is that it keeps falling off of my dashboard. Not sure why since the base is very sticky and I lock it in place.
Perfect battery and a great price.  Works perfectly in my phone and has restored my battery life back to original like new condition.
"Very surprised with the audio quality!  Based on some of the other reviews, I was expecting a slight decrease in overall fidelity and bass.  Believe it or not, the audio is richer and &#34;bassier&#34; when using this receiver.  I can't tell you how happy I am with this.  My 2007 Volvo S60 has a 3.5mm mini-port in the middle armrest compartment.  Therefore, it was always a pain to plug my iphone using a cord - and recently, it wouldn't even stay seated in my iphone due to the case I was using.  This has completely solved all of my problems and updates my car with current technology.  I just need to figure out how to disable phone calls from running through this since I prefer to keep that localized to my phone."
Nice Watch
Good for the price. Sounds decent. A little uncomfortable . U got get use of it.
"A durable case, screen protector and belt clip.  The belt clip is a bit large & clunkey but for my need of wireless charging it might be to cumberson to constantly install, remove the belt clip."
Got this for my brother for his S6. He loves it.
Returned it.
Absolutely love this. It does what it says it'll do & it doesn't it with style
i thought it was a phone i was buying but it don't have any up to date functions on it i would have sent it back but my daughters boyfriend wanted it i don't know for what though it don't do anything
Worth having this product.
great buy super fast shipping a+++
Easy to apply. Does what it is supposed to do.
This is what I needed but didn't realize the weight. It's about as big as an iPhone 6 but 3x's thicker. Charges quickly and still have more charges if need to charge other things
"Awesome band, easy to install and I get alot of comments."
"I purchased and it cracked when I dropped phone Tech Armor sent out a replacement. No problems, I recommend their product and customer service folks. They sent a replacement glass, I was driving on my motorcycle today and my I phone 6 fell out of the holder at 60 mph. The phone landed on the the Tech Armor glass, it shattered, but it protected my phone. I removed the armor glass and the phone does not have a scratch. I would never expected this, but it worked. I am happy."
I bought this for my husband for his birthday. He uses it all the time for his phone. Very handy and very sturdy.
We returned this item right away because the phone was cracked and did not meet our needs.
My wife likes this case.
"The volume buttons are not properly placed for the LG 740 Volt phone. There is also no indentation between volume up, and volume down functions. The belt holder also blocks the volume down button, disallowing screenshot use. I would give it zero stars, since I can't use it with my phone."
"The rubberized case is well textured and grips well. It also has a barely noticeable kickstand if you want to stand it up and use it hands free. Though I only used it once, the removable holster is secure and works well if you use the pressure and friction of your fingertips low on the case to slide it up and out enough to grip the top of the phone ( it's easier to actually do than it is for me to say how ). It's not cheaply made and I recommend it."
Fit perfectly! Highly recommended!
perfect for what I needed
They're so great! Not one complaint. And not one of them broke. They work on any device screen.
Love it! It is really easy to open and talk on the phone w/out the lid flipping back closed. Designed really well and would purchase again.
Great experience
Very happy with my Anker external battery. First one came defective but Anker took care of it with great customer service and speedy delivery. Great product and I don't leave home without it. Bought one for the boyfriend and he loves it just as much. Highly recommend.
love it!
"Excellent product, finding more and more uses."
"Very good camera, however, the holder that attaches to the windshield is poorly constructed, broke within 2 weeks of use.  Customer service immediately took care of the problem and replaced the holder.  Very good overall experience."
I never leave product reviews but this has to be the worst product I have ever bought on Amazon. The case has broken at ALL 4 corners. I have had multiple iphones and multiple cases from different producers without any issues. I would never consider another flexion product again.
Screen arrived shattered and unusable. Could not use. Missing tools.
Works just the way described! I got it to go tubing in Austin and I was able to take crystal clear photos in the tube. We were also able to listen to Pandora while floating!<br /><br />There are a few weaknesses in the product although it does not take away from my 5 star rating.<br /><br />-the screen can bubble causing you to not be able to clearly see the picture you are taking (although I didn't have this problem until the very end of the day and the final pictures still came out clear)<br /><br />-be careful not to tear the silicone screen with sharp fingernails. I inadvertently did this and I do not consider this to be a manufacturer's defect<br /><br />Overall I will be reordering for my next trip. Great price for the protection!!
never got any parts to go with the gps what good is it with out parts
"These are awesome!  They are beautiful, well made and my daughter absolutely loves them. They sync with multiple devices, the battery lasts long and the volume controls are great.  I wish they made them for adults... I would totally purchase a pair."
Excellent
"IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE LEATHER, LOOKS VERY CHEAP :("
this case fits nice and easy to put on
Very Good case
very good
"Very comfortable. I use these while bike riding because the ear buds hurt your ears after a while as well as the sweat making it so they won't stay in.<br />With these they are comfortable over the ears on long rides and I can hear well even with the wind, which these help block out.<br />The resorption is great and the hands free answering calls works well. My callers say they can hear me well.<br />My only little nag is that they aren't as low profile on the sides as I would like but this wouldn't prevent me from purchasing them again.<br />Battery life is great and so far I have yet to run them dead after 3 hours continual use"
"It's lightweight, very comfortable, and can even fit my phone with a thin case on it."
Worked b- for a bit..now the static is too bad to unDer stand anyone
Way cheaper than the AT&T store for a very similar quality product.
Very  colorgul snd well made.  Looks great on my phone
My fault for buying a hard case. It lasted about 5 months. I dropped my phone in the kitchen and the case cracked. Do yourself a favor and get a rubber or silicone case.
"The product arrived on time and appears to be the item pictured. It claims to be oleophobic but after only 3 days I already have finger oil stains that will not rub out. That being said, the protector seems to be serving its purpose; I have already dropped the phone once face down from waist height and there was no visible damage. I think a little oil glare is worth the protection factor."
Exactly fits the Samsung S6 Edge. I gifted this for my mother and she loves it. There is a shortage of cases out there for the Edge and this one looks fancy and it keeps the screen clean. I would recommend buying a screen protector though just in case. It does leave your phone very vulnerable since there's no protection.
"The case meets the expectations , thin, elegant , and the price falls within the range of the competition. I am satisfied with my purchase. Thanks!!!"
"Easy to put on ! Very good quality ive bought these before and got flimsy cheaply made ones i was very satisfied with this one it was sturdy and went on easily , a must for anyone looking to protect theyre precious screen!"
Works good the only issue I have is the mute button on the headphones it does not match up with my Cisco soft phone on my PC. When I am on mute on the Cisco soft phone and unmute it from the Cisco softphone the mute stays on the headphones.Other than that they are very clear.
Horrible quality do not buy. Armband feels like its going to rip when applied on arm. Does not stay put.
Love it
"This w=is a great case. It's clear but protects the phone well. Got a quick delivery, on Sunday even."
"NO IT DOESNT FIT ALL GALAZY 3, MINE IS S3-S968C AND THE CASE IS WAY TOO SMALL"
Nice slim design  and fits like a glove..
Great!!!!!!!!!!
The only problem I had with it was the bottom and top edge pieces staying stuck down. Other than that it's beautiful and shiny(:
"I was looking for a good, cheap screen protector and with all these 4-5 star reviews i thought this was the perfect screen protector but boy as i wrong, i was very upset with the way it handled my first drop! The screen didnt do anything at all but only make my real screen crack even more! It is partially my fault but it is also very false advertising, when they say it can withstand high impact drops it cant even withstand 1 meter drop. So what do they really mean high impact drops? Next time i will for sure be doing a little more research on products such as screen protectors. With that aside there were no little bumps/air pockets when you put your screen on."
perfect stand
"This case is awesome! I drop my phone all the time and it protects it very well. I also like the fact that I do not have to carry around my large purse anymore. My id and two other cards fit perfectly in it. I've also been able to squeeze in money as well although its not even when you do so. Overall, I'm very happy with my buy and would buy it again!"
It broke the first time I took it off
The case a little thick but good quality
"Yes, thank you"
"Takes forever to charge my Samsung S5, supposedly it takes an hour to fully charge not the case."
A+++ Product and seller
"perfect, already has made me feel safer on the road and in the bush"
Isn't oke
These are great little speakers. Bluetooth connectivity is easy on both my phone and laptop. The sound is amazing for the size of the speaker with good bass response.<br /><br />Phone calls can be routed through with ease and the built in microphone is adequate. Very portable and with a decent battery life and good recharge time. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this and several of my friends have bought one after hearing mine. At this price you can't afford not to.
Nice case
"Very good quality!  comes with everything, very happy with them, sound great and exactly the same to the ones that they gave me with my Samsung galaxy s5(: would definitely recommend!!"
"The worst!  I did a good bit of research before buying but it did not help.  The phone froze, turn off, or turn into a black screen and locked. I finally returned it to factory condition and am trying to sell it.  I needed Motorola's help to return it to factory condition because it was locked. I did not lock it.  Motorola said it locked itself because it thought an unidentified user was trying to use it.  What a waste of time.  Stay away and save your money."
Works great!
What a waste of money and time<br />Ordered 2 chargers last week<br />They were fine for the first week then both of them stopped working<br />Called amazon and returned both of them<br />Still i had to pay for shipping.<br />Do not buy this.
Great great great!!!!!
The LifeProof case for iPhone 6 has poorly designed cover of the charger port. The charger cover will snap open too easily exposing the phone. It happened to me when I was kayaking and had the phone in my pocket just to find out later the case was leaking and my phone was dead. I used to have the Lifeproof case for the iPhone 5 and the design was much more robust.
Its great one
The only problem is that is bronken after four week
It is so cute 😍
Super loud and clear.  I was really surprised on how great they sound for how inexpensive these speakers are.  You can hear me coming 5 blocks away on my golf cart.  I have exactly 100 pure watts RMS running to each of them and I can't get them to distort.  Great product so far.  Highly recommend
Great selfie stick to own. Easy to set up and use! Customer support fantastic. Every single query I made was addressed promptly. Love it!
Fine fit looks good.
"Bought these cables to work with several iPhones in our house that live inside Lifeproof cases.  Fits perfectly!  Thank you!  I love the idea of the Lifetime Warranty as these cabels (mostly the Apple originals) wear out quickly.  I hope to never have to call in on my warranty, but happy to know they are there.  I know where I am coming to purchase cable replacements the next time a non-Luxtr cable wears out.  Thanks again!"
Great durable phone case especially for a klutz like me. Only issue is that it increases the phone size by a quarter inch on all sides and doubles the weight of the phone
"Looks great, feels great, and arrived on time!  Thanks!"
"Doesn't work on my iPad Air. Would not advised purchasing this product. I have tried different charging bricks and it's the same thing, I get a message that my iPad is not charging."
I bought this for my wife and she loves it.
so far works great and feels sturdy too.
excellent product
I love it
"Works as described.  Holds phone securely, but still easy to get out when needed."
Dope!
Duh bomb diggity.
This battery is not new in any way. Manufactured in 2012. Received and installed only to find it had 500+ charge cycles and the capacity had dropped to almost 50%.
"Not worth it honestly, says it is scratch  resistant but it's all full of scratches, they're hard to see but shine light onto it and you'll see them everywhere. Dirt and whatnot goes through it so if you buy it don't expect it to seal and keep your phone clean also edges stain. Now it is a faded yellow and has blue due to my jeans. As far as protecting it it seems decent, I purchased a glass screen protector so that has mainly been keeping it together, recently dropped it hard and screen protector slightly cracked, if I didn't have it on I feel like it would've damaged the screen. Other times I've dropped my phone height was relatively low/soft drop."
Works great. Thanks for the prompt shipment
"It is beautiful but it snags.  If only it used unpronged crystals around.  So I used nail polish to coat it.  The plastic surrounding the phone to encase it snapped and broke after just 3 weeks of use.  This version also has no inner pocket for cash, just the credit card slots."
"Garbage. That's the only word that comes to mind.  The plastic feels like garbage, the thin rubber surround feels like garbage, it's just garbage."
"It took a little time for me to write this review because I prefer to try a product out completely over time. I did have a problem with the cable, the camera would shut off when the car was in motion and I would have to screw around with the connector to get it to turn on again, after a few miles it would shut off again, this was corrected when I notified the company which promptly sent me a new cable. The problem now seems to be fixed. About the camera itself...it's a really good little camera, the picture is really clear and the colors are very natural. This camera rivals many more expensive models. Take a look at the YouTube videos, they speak for themselves. The only problem I have (with any of these cameras) is, the setting buttons are really small, for a man's hands that can be a problem, but other than that I really don't have any other complaints with this camera. It does what it was designed to do. The company is really nice to deal with if you do have a problem, like with any electronic device, things can and do go wrong sometimes, but this company responds quickly to rectify a problem which keeps their costumers happy. Over all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this very reasonably priced camera to any one looking to purchase a car camera. When an accident happens, and they do, it's nice to have a visual account to protect yourself. This is a very sensible purchase for anyone."
"Decent grip once you figure out its supposed to clip in with the phone sideways, so the clip is open as wide as the phone."
So far so good love it
My special needs daughter uses the stylys with her iPad and it's so nice to be able to replace the tip instead of the whole stylus.  They hold up very well.
This thing was good just didn't work out for what I needed which was a phone mount on my boat. It couldn't handle the vibration at full speed. The suction held but the arm would flop down and finally snapped off. For a car this would be awesome.  Update- great service from seller on warranty!
It's great. Love the fit over the phone and the kickstand is excellent
Color is dull/ugly in person. Almost looks like plastic. Can only fit 5 cards comfortably. Hole for stylus access is sharp and uncomfortable.
ggreat!
"Didn't want a case for my G2 initially, but after a fall at work I had little choice. Looks pretty cool, has a nice sized lip around the screen of the phone, and is pretty rugged in general. It also doesn't add too much bulk to the phone. It's not slim mind you, but it's liveable"
Super good
I was very impressed when I received this product but disappointed that it wouldn't work with my apple watch. This design requires the watch to lay flat. My Milanese Loop does not. When I ordered it that issue was unknown and I contacted the suppliers and they were very professional and concerned that they were unaware of that issue at that time.  I had received it at a discounted price for an honest review. My honest thoughts are I would have been happy with this product. It's light weight. It's sturdy. It does not look or feel cheap. It has a layer of glue or what feels like the post its glue sticky in the battery hole to help it adhere to the product and stay in place. It's really a thoughtful design. I just wish it had worked for me.
"Bought this as a replacement for my s5, it stopped working two months later, they did not want to replace this for me. Very disappointed. If an item is defected, it should be automatically  replaced regardless  of how many days passed since tou bought it. Do yourselves  a favor a DONT waste youre money.  Get it from youre phone providers store. Thank you<br />Ps. I would give it ZERO stars if possible"
Very cute colors and perfect fit!!
Too thick for the Home button.
It was really nice for a couple of days. It did make me lose service every once in a while. But after only a few days of use it no longer charges my phone. It just doesn't power on. I'm going to find a better one.
Love this case! I have had it for about 2 months and it is working great!
Fit my phone well.  The shipping was fast and the price was more than reasonable.  Would highly recommend for a low cost option to protect your phone.
"It actually broke on me,the sides split."
I had read other reviews about this product.  Since I read the negative reviews as well as the positive I was concerned that the case would not fit well or protect the phone.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  The case is extremely well engineered and fits perfectly and should provide excellent protection.
The case is awesome and is very sturdy.
Horrible quality!! I went through six in under a month
"Was very upset, I ordered the New Mexico cover and in stead I got the Minnesota cover. Have no other complaints  on any other orders."
Mine broke in a couple of days.
The case is too bulky and is made from two pieces. The quality of the materials seems ok but I dont like it's bulk.
Item works as expected.
works
not good for me ..
"This fits over the Galaxy S6 Edge perfectly, without the added frustration of trying to stuff in an inner rubber bumper. Dropped it several feet while bike riding, and the case has a small dirty dent; but the phone is still in perfect condition. I haven't had the time to make my own backings, but the benefit of being able to change it whenever I want is awesome. While not a game changer; I just wish the website had a digital template to work off of instead of a flimsy paper stencil."
"I absolutely love this case. I ordered one for my husband and when I saw the quality of his I had to have one for myself as well. It fits the phone like a glove and I believe it will do a great job of protecting it. My husband dropped his on concrete and not only did it protect the phone, but there was not a scratch on the case either! I ordered the blue/black and it looks awesome. Also, I have not found that the flash on my camera turns my pictures the color of the case as some people said. And the screen protector seems to be very good quality, not cheap and plasticy like some said; I can't even tell it's there. I honestly like this case better than otter box. Would highly recommend it."
Great product. Earpieces could have more sizes to fit.
Great product..
"These headphones were a great purchase.  I have small ears and few headphones of this style fit me well.  These have a lot of accessory pieces that helped get it properly sized.  They stay snugly fit, no matter the activity level. They also have a better range than I anticipated."
"Hello,I bay so many things from Amazon and I never had problem until now,I revive my Samsung 6 edge yesterday but my camera is not working proper,can not focus.<br />I read  so many reviews but I can t fix the problem,do I have to replace the phone or I m missing some ting so I can fix issue by my self .<br />Thank you."
"fonctionne bien , rien a dire appart Top Notch!!!*****"
"I bought this about two years ago. Today (August 29th 2015), this screen protector is still on my iPad and works just fine and lasts on the screen pretty much forever. Easy installation with no bubbles (just simply follow the rules). The sides have lifted up, but it still protects my iPad screen and definitely reduces the glares from excess sunlight."
Works very well! so nice to know I could fall in the pool or get caught in the rain and no problem!
Just want I needed...
Nice
"Love it!!! Looks great, feels great, no complaints. Everything I wanted in a case, looks good and my phone is well protected."
i love this case so much. I've always bought dandy classes for my iPhone 5 this is my first one for my iPhone 6 plus and it's the prettiest one by far!!! I loveeee this cases!! Great buy I highly recommend them to anyone and everyone
"Where's the mute button?  Why does it seem that these Bluetooth headsets are getting more expensive, yet loose features, and feel cheaper?"
"Fits perfect, and actually makes it easier to slide out the keyboard."
"My favourite....<br /><br />2nd case ordered , it is protective and holds 4 cards and a IOttie metal square to hold on IOttie vent car clip.<br /><br />The 1st case was not bad,  It took allot of abuse from me and when I was at the beach it took a sand beaten..Could I have continued to use it sure, but it was time to get a fresh one..<br /><br />Note: I dropped my phone a few times and thought each time it is done in ...But each time it was good as new.. Edging was enough to keep out good<br /><br />For the money spent this is a great product"
Very good!
Great cables.
"As a family of four with smartphones, tablets, kindles, etc we were constantly fighting over the chargers in the living room, or we'd secretly hide a charger or two in the bedroom to keep the kids from swiping them.  Then I got one of these, plugged in a couple of [[ASIN:B00VUNHJCS multi-headed charge cables]] and that all of that stopped.  Not only is there (almost) always a free plug, but everything stays put now since it's tucked away inside a [[ASIN:B0017K8W5W Digipower SAM-G100-CH charger organizer]].<br /><br />I'm tempted to put one of these at my desk at work since people are always looking for power there. Seems like a great way to meet your coworkers and have them feel slightly indebted to you..."
Works great with my ATT Note 4. Has a large coil that my Note 4 see's as soon as it's placed on it.  The size gives my Note a sturdy base to sit on so I can tap anywhere on the screen and not knock it off the charger.
Holds a credit card and drivers license perfectly!  Seemed a little stiff to slide at first but once used a few times it is fine.
I like the arm band/phone case because I can gain easy access to the phone and my MapMyRun app on my runs. Didn't use the protector because it's too permanent.
"This is exactly what I was looking for - A nice thin case that fits the iPhone perfectly.  My only complaint is that after about 4 months, it started to yellow a little - I loved how crystal clear it was at the start.  But at this price, I just purchased another and tossed the yellowed one out.  Perfect!"
very good
Works great! I would recommend using something bigger than the lens to press it in place. Which is why I am buying it again....
Not a a lot of great cases for the galaxy edge phone that are great for protecting the edges. But this case really does. I would love if it would protect the front of the phone. But very happy overall with is case.
Cute but scratches easily
Love it! I'm
"It has many isses with languag, and masseges sice it loses the contacts between numbers and messages."
"Works great, simple to install.  Just take your time and watch the video."
"It says retail packaging, but it comes in a white box, definetely not retail."
Saved my iPod!!  It is NOT for the week hearted but it does work great.  Tool failed when used.  The battery did not last 6 months!  I am not impressed!!
a
Makes my laptop tolerable!
Awesome tempered glass. Really protects your actual screen from damage
I received this case with my iwatch stand. It fit very well and I thought it was doing a great job of protecting my watch. Little did I know what it was doing under the surface. I took off the case to clean my watch and found a TON of scratches. I'm so upset. Be careful with this case!!!
Exactly as expected...great item fast shipping.
I was sent the wrong size pouch.  I am looking forward to having the right size case.  It's just what I need to carry the charger and it's cables.
"Flimsy, useless."
It's exactly like the photo not very protective tho feels nice in the hand as well
👍🏻
We bought 2 of these cases for a trip to Bermuda.  They worked great.  Loved the colors and how well they worked.
I have brought mine to the beach a few times and i feel a lot better about using it near sand and water
Great product! Prompt delivery as well.
Waste of money. My 12 daughter thought she was buying an actual case. I wish I could figure out how to return it.
"I love this case! The only reason I gave it one less star is because I cannot fit my headphone cord into the hole through the case when I want to listen to music. In order to do so, I have to remove the case."
"the stick is amazing. works perfectly with my iPhone 6 and love the button on the handle, it's really cool, i love this selfie stick! Great price aswell."
Great product. Didn't not have any issues with it in Florida. Fast shipping.
"Fits well, strong hold. Does not fall, unless you apply very strong force."
I love this case looks really good everything feels great. Really tight fit premium feel also.
"Fit great, AM/FM stations clear, looks BETTER"
"Another quality product from Anker! Simple, well designed, packaging and product. Charges all of my devices at full speed. I suspect it could even power my house in a pinch. Some people are stocking up on weapons for the apocalypse; I'm going to stock up on batteries and chargers :)"
"fast shipment, great quality for the price."
"very nice, love the colors, just wishing there were more choices for those of us, who own droids; not everyone has an I-phone!"
"I was extremely pleased with the fit and appearance of this case, but the plastic framework that holds the phone in place on the top left side broke with a few weeks.  I glued it back together, and it has broken again, about an inch from the the first break.  I love the case itself, but am disappointment that the framework that holds the phone is so weak.  Is this typical of this case, or did I perhaps get a defective one?"
"No instructions, and it didn't stick correctly."
if you have a garmin for your motorcycle this is the cable you need to hard wire it to the bike.
excelent
Do not order these. They are useless.
"Bought my second one last week for my wife's car. So far, these cables seem to hold up much better than the other cables we've purchased online and in stores."
"I have had this holster for about a month now, and it is holding up extremely well. It appears to be very rugged and well constructed. It is also very versatile, because it can be attached to a belt in a variety of ways. As shown in the pictures, it has a heavy duty metal clip which will allows it to attach vertically to a belt, but it also has provisions to allow a belt to looped through the holster either vertically or horizontally, eliminating the possibility of becoming unhooked from the belt. It also comes with a &#34;D&#34; ring to enable a 4th way to attach the holster to a backpack or whatever. It holds my BLU 6.0 phone perfectly and securely. I would highly recommend this quality product for those of us who do not put our phones in our pockets."
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
"Great product.  Looks great and best of all, sounds great.  Everyone at work wants one now.  Worth every penny!"
"This product is fantastic. For 13 dollars you get a very large amount of battery, enough to hold many charges. Buy this product. You will not regret it."
"Works, but clunky to use.  NOT INTUITIVE..."
"For a fair review, I received a discount on my order and I'm happy to say this case is fantastic. Protects my phone and doesn't make it bulky at all. Very happy customer!"
This phone is amazing
"Great, durable product. Fast delivery."
"Got me through a study abroad in Brazil and back.  It even served as a makeshift light for a hike back.  Durability nearly rivals the brick, and the double sim card is quite useful.  Never once used the headphones, just tossed them.  Good battery life, went days &#60;-- plural without a charge multiple times.  Obviously I didn't call much during those days, but it still worked, and kept me away from being a target for theft.  Definitely going to use it on my next long term trip.<br /><br />You have to delete the old texts though, and there's not a quick process for it.  Kind of a pain in the ass actually, because the texts just never reach you if your mailbox is full.  It's as if they weren't sent, so stay on top of that for sure."
The 1 URPOWER pack that I am using on my one cordless phone that died is working very well.
Great option for a cheaper connector than the one directly from LifeProof. Haven't had any issues yet.
Great for running in my iphone +<br />Seem it will last a while
The color was so faded and broke after I put it on. Would never buy again
"Pros:  Installs way easier than plastic film covers. Incredibly slick and smooth,  even more elegant to the touch than the original screen.  Very resistant to scratch.  No regrets at all.<br /><br />Cons:  On the Note 4, the protector doesn't cover the outer 2 millimeters around the edges, because the original screen is slightly rounded, and thus a wider flat protector would not adhere. It is very minor, the unprotected part is very small and negligible,  thus I still give this 5 stars."
This is a horrible excuse for an android tablet.  Some slick (slimey) Verizon sales person sold this to my 85 year old father for $250 plus monthly data fees.  The tablet has 4G space but only 1G allowed for apps and the preloaded apps take 75% of that available space.  Even firmware upgrade can't fix the issue. So my parents are out over $500 for a piece of #@%& they can't return to Verizon.  Stay far away.
"Terrible, all broke in less than a week. Not worth the money and irritation."
Wonderful product. Been looking for one for months but everything was too pricey. This is perfect and fits my watch and iPhone 6 plus wonderfully!!!!
I had hard time to put on my iphone and to secure to my desk  clips are too hard to use
"Works great, nice price."
"Having recently learned about the negative effects of &#34;blue light&#34; - I bought these for me and really like them.  I never noticed it until I put this on the phone, just how much blue light is produced.  My eye doctor suggested getting special lenses for me and my kids, and it occurred to me that this would be a much cheaper solution, and it was!"
Excellent Case
"We bought this both my and my husbands phones.  LOVE that if something is going to give... it's the invisibleShield glass that breaks and not my phone glass... And... on my Samsung, I've had to replace it twice now. It's not the mfg fault... I'm the one dropping my phone and it does protect the actual glass on the phone... just look forward to the day that neither break."
Good fit looks great.
"I think this power adapter works well, but I only had it a couple months before my Google Nexus 7 stopped taking a charge.  However, the problem is with my device and not really with this adapter.  It's solid, it's one piece, and it does what it says it's supposed to."
I have bought many screen protectors in the past. This is the best one I have ever installed on my phone.
"So far, this product works great."
Received product and it was exactly as described. The charger is well made and very easy to use. I am very pleased with my purchase. This is one of my 3 Ravpower products. I have never been disappointed with how well they work.
Great price! Great case! Perfect fit. Rugged but not too big. Easy to hold and easy to use phone. Provides a solid grip. Beautiful color.
good
Amazing
"I bought this for my boyfriend, and he loves it!!!!! It stays charged forever!!! If you play ingess, this is a must have!"
Came fast. Love it.  Good quality
"This phone has BIG issues with messaging.  At first, the phone is great for a cheaper smart phone, but after having it for a few months, I started having issues receiving and sending text messages.  I called AT&T customer care, and they took care of the problem, after a half an hour of being on the phone with them.  This same exact problem happened to me abut 4 times more, before I decided to use the warranty, and ask for a new phone.  Of course, I didn't get an updated phone from this, I got the same one, and I have also had the same problems with this phone. This phone would be better used as an iPod. Though, the music app downloaded onto the phone is very glitchy.  Needles to say, don't buy this phone unless you want a lot of problems."
Not appropriate for cell Blu 4.5 camera opening located in the wrong area!
Easy to assemble and use.  Very sturdy.
Love it
Slim and protects the phone very well. Would buy again!
Usb3.0 works great. Easy storage. Fits in messenger bag pocket.
"I have only used it for a couple weeks.  It seems to hold a charge as well as the previous battery, though it does get hot as the previous one did.  My original battery swelled to twice its original size so I purchased this as a replacement"
My husband needed smooth case for ease of slipping the phone in and out of his pocket.  This was great.
my usb was damaged - called sharkk for replacement usb - they sent new mouse and usb - wow
Awful
Great.  Love it.
Super cute but the first time my phone droped on my wood floor it cracked my screen.  I had a cheaper case on it before that protected my phone from hitting concrete several times and never had any issues.  Unfortunate...should've just kept my worn out one on.
Stinks
It's great!
After about a week of having it my wife showed be that it started to rip where it bends. The case looked nice till this happened. I guess you get what you pay for.
Can't beat it for the price.
Excellent.
"Ever since my first smartphone purchase several years ago, I've had a Speck case on my phone.  So, when I got a 5s a few months back I went with the Speck Candyshell. It fits my iPhone 5s perfectly and I haven't had any issues with using the volume buttons, or accessing the other ports, switches, etc.  It's not bulky, and protects my phone from drops.  The back of the case does show wear and scratches if you hold it in the light, but that doesn't bother me.  I'll definitely keep coming back to this brand!"
I purchased this selfie stick for a scavenger hunt we were doing where we had to submit pics of each task. It was such a great idea and the product is very well designed and constructed by the company. This particular stick was adjustable so it fit each one of our team members phones even though they were all different sizes and brands. It came in a box with simple instructions to put the 2-3 parts together and even had suggestions for use. We had a fun time and it even inspired our competitors to go and buy a cheapo one. We also got a chance to use it on the our cruise to Mexico. There are lots of products out there and I have had one from another company but this has been the best of it's kind and I would recommend it to anyone.
"Good headset for the money. Functional, communicative and works for me. Can't touch the Bose though."
Phone stills works after 2 years.
Bought a second because I liked the sleek appearance.
Works great!
it works very nice with 850 3G
"The pins that extend from the band that slides in the watch (the pins that create the loop for the band) are very cheap and within a few minutes of having the watch on they came out. Seems to be of cheaper quality. The packaging was nice and it arrived quickly and the rose gold had good color to it, although it didn't pair as well with the Sport watch silver metal as I had hoped it would. The supplied adjustment tool to remove the pins was cheap but it got the job done and is a must have for DIY adjustments of the band. In summary, I just didn't feel comfortable having this band keep a $400 watch on my wrist."
My favorite going-out case. Wish it didn't have the antenna hole. Very sharp and well-fitting. Love the coffee color combo.
Good for the money
"Great for the Iphone 6. We are hard on phone really heard on them but these covers have done a great job well over a year and the phones are still like new,"
Nice camera and easy to use
"Great protection for my phone. Ive dropped it a few times especially when getting out of my car, and still good. Easy to clean too."
"I received this so that I could use it and review it.  and give my unbiased opinion. First I want to say It was way easier to put on than i thought. it passed the test if me trying to scratch it with my keys. It even witheld the face down drop from about 3 feet. this is a quality screen protector,"
Battery is shot less than a week after buying it. It dies starting at 15%
Durable and sturdy
OEM unit.  same that comes with many phones.<br />sounds decent. pretty comfortable.<br />good value.
it has a hard time understanding voice commands so I always type in address I want. Other than that works good
"S pen works accurately, battery last for well over 24 hours and that is with listening get to Pandora and tunein radio for 10 hours. Graphics are crisp and clear. Camera works well. If I needed a phone, I would buy this again."
"If you want to cut down on your mobile phone usage, this is the phone for you.  Set up is simple - but make sure not to slip into accessibility mode or all the buttons become unresponsive.  The menu (needed to undo this) is cleverly hidden (hold down the bottom right button for long enough - but you may find this tricky in accessibility mode).  In this mode the phone can also lock you out completely with the easy solution of a hard reset - make sure to delete the backup of everything you have managed to install before doing that.  Switching between 4G and 3G networks is not a problem (the phone seems to have trouble doing this on its own) - just go 3 levels down into that hidden menu and change from CDMA / LTE mode to CDMA mode (you knew what those stood for didn't you?).  Then there is the the way they have pre-installed a bunch of apps you do not want and made them hard to remove.  This ensures that you have at least space for 4 medium sized apps that you do want.  Add to this that within weeks this phone got stuck in headphone mode.  What a great (if expensive) paper weight this phone makes."
Useful
It was not what I expected I thought it was the phone case but I was wrong
"Love this case! Very durable. If I had to say 1 bad thing about this case it is that the charger cover doesn't go in all the way and it gets in the way of charging your phone sometimes. Other than that, I have 2 children who still haven't managed to break my phone thanks to this case."
Quality product
My wife loved it!
"Excellent product, product waterproof and it protects my phone when i  saw the rain. Take pictures, receive and call anytime. I no longer worry about my phone when it rains. Because, i have waterproof. Thank to seller so much!"
"I just had to replace my Motorola Bluetooth after several years of use, and got the same model because I like it so much.  It is easy to use and has great clarity."
Works good!
Fast delivery. Will recommend
Best case! Baby / toddler proof
Very pleased with product
"Excellent Price<br /><br />Great product, great quality."
Great cleaner.
"Excellent price, excellent quality. It was not too bulky and my dad found it acceptable, which means it is great. It actually looks very sleek and modern. On regards to safety, it appears very sturdy and fits the phone well. I definitely recommend it."
I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />This case seems very well constructed. It fits easily onto my phone and is very secure. It adds bulk to the phone comparable to any non-otterbox/lifeproof case.<br /><br />I would recommend this.
It was great l loved it keep up the good work 
"I've had this watch for a little over a month now, and let me say this thing is awesome. Android Wear allows me to easily view my notifications and respond to texts without having to pull my phone out, and when its raining, thats a very nifty thing. setting reminders is super quick and simple, as well as setting things like timers and alarms.<br />The battery gets me all the way through the day (I haven't tried the ambient settings as the &#34;lift to turn on&#34; works just fine for me), and I can charge it while i'm in the shower before I go to bed so I can use it with Sleep as Android to track my sleeping habits. the cradle charges the watch really quickly too which is very nice.<br />i've more than once accidentally scraped the glass on something, but have yet to have any scratches on any part of the watch.<br />the screen has a great set of brightness levels and is still mostly readable in direct sun, although not as easy as traditional watches<br /><br />the only con here I have, would be the leather strap. I love the grey color, and it feels pretty great, but if I sweat or get it wet it tends to leave a slight discoloring on my wrist which washes away with a good scrubbing. also, the leather strap soaks up sweat and smells pretty nasty. I would certainly suggest buying a metal watch strap from your local jeweler or online. Because they made it use the standard watch strap size so its easy to find an alternative, i'm not dropping a star for this very minuscule issue"
very good product
Great gift for a friend
Went kayaking down river and case worked perfectly. I have iphone 6 plus and it fits perfectly. I did the water test before I put my phone in it. Did not take any pictures underwater but it did it did get in water with it around my neck and no problems with water coming in. Very good for me!
great
"I have used this now the last couple months and it has done VERY well for me.  I typically get about 2 full charges from it for my Samsung Galaxy S4.  The charging time for the unit itself seems a little long, but is worth the trade off.  I have even had a few occasions to use the flashlight feature which is much more handy than expected."
Came broken very disappointed
"This is nice for watching movies.<br />Fast computer. Windows 8 is very frustrating though. Otherwise it is great for surfing internet, shopping, taking photos and checking email."
The product was broken after a week of use!
"I do not have a smart phone.  I could not get this to sync with my wireless laptop.<br />I love the design, the fit and numbers, but if I can't sync to anything, it wasn't worth keeping."
"Reliable, fits the car well and made a great mount! Well worth the money I paid for it, does the same job compared to others 3 times the price! It was a little bit hard getting it into the vent at first, but once it clicked, it didn't move anywhere."
"Amazing product, the most fastest charger ever seen! fully recommended!"
"Compact, easy to use, lots of power. Seems well made. Holds a charge when not in use. Perfect for someone like me that can be in remote areas where I may need to recharge devices several times before getting to an AC power source."
I like it
I just love this case nice and sturdy compared to otter box it's great thanks
Works fine.
Excellent
"I got this for my car (Fiat 500c) and it works really well. I put the rectangular (not sticky, which was also included in the order) magnet between my phone(Galaxy S6) and the case. It's a very strong magnet and sticks to my phone really well, but I can also easily rotate my phone to landscape mode while it's attached.<br /><br />The car vent part was great. It holds the phone perfectly and the part that attaches to the vent is a soft rubber so it doesn't scratch. I also imagine it would fit various vent sizes. It didn't cover the whole vent and allowed for plenty of air flow.<br /><br />Here is what I thought of as a postive, but maybe it's a negative for some. When I pull my phone off, it takes the vent clip with it. I personally only use this when I need my GPS, and since my car is a tiny clown car, I hate extra things when I'm not using them. So I then pull it from my phone and store it in the door slot. I love it. It's easy on, easy off, it's perfect.<br /><br />My only slight bummer is that you can't wirelessly charge your phone while the magnet is on. So I just stick that to the vent clip and store them together. Then I slip the magnet into the case when I need it. If you don't wirelessly charge, then keep the magnet in all the time! It's super thin and I don't notice it at all."
It's so good I like it
Exactly what I was expecting beautiful color and style.
"Netsun has a high quality cable that is hard to distinguish from the original Apple cable that came with my iPhone. While it doesn’t specifically state that it is “Apple MiFi Certified” like Belkin and other brands, I really cannot prove that it is not. The Netsun cable charges fine without any incompatibility messages and it syncs my iPhone just as fast as my Apple cable does. Both the USB and lightning connectors fit snug into their perspective ports, and the cable strains seem like they are durable and should last a long time. You cannot beat Netsun’s 100% Lifetime Satisfaction guarantee, a free replacement with no questions asked – sounds good to me, as long as I don’t have to pay to ship the original one back to China. Providing the cable passes authentication in iOS 9 which will be released in a few weeks, I would highly recommend purchasing Netsun’s cable.<br /><br />Netsun provided a free sample cable for this review."
Feels the same as an otterbox. Great quality and protection.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for a review.
"I am VERY happy with this holder.  The suction mount and positioning abilities are very high quality.  I use a 5.5 inch screen phone and a thin, hard-shell case.  The thin, metal plate fits easily between the back of my phone and its case, and it holds very firmly on the TechMatte's magnet.  I don't need the gripper portion, although it is also very nice quality.  And while it holds firmly, it also comes off when I want to grab my phone.<br />What I like the most about this mount is the ability to quickly put the phone on, or take it off with one hand and no fumbling about.  You can place the phone on it lengthwise, or straight up and down without difficulty.  Once on, the phone doesn't move while I'm driving through any turns, stops, or bumps.  It's just plain easy, reliable and functional.<br />The mount's suction cup is the best I've ever used -- and I've used many over the years.  It'll hold firm on any windshield, or on a dashboard horizontal pad.  The angle adjustments are easy to use, also high quality, and they hold firmly once in place.<br />This product is absolute proof of &#34;you get what you pay for.&#34;  Sure, you can get a cheaper Chinese knock-off on Ebay...but it won't be anything nearly as good.  I'm sold.  I'll be happy with this system for years.  I will likely purchase more as gifts for my kids this Christmas."
"Absolutely exactly what I wanted!! Couldn't see anything wrong with the phone. It does not come with Apple charger, but it still works and charges the phone. Couldn't be happier with my purchase."
"Great stick! Holds a lot of charge, connects easily, good strong hold of the phone. Definitely recommended!"
Received my easay2pick takgs(2) about 2 weeks ago. It doesn't work. I guess Ill have to spend a small fortune buying 4 new batteries. Anyy ets that wont fix the problem?
"Great!!! Love it, haven't dropped w case on yet so haven't tested it that way but the case is great quality.  but sometimes comes apart"
Nice back up camera for the price
Great Product
Nice case..slim design
"I've had this phone for a couple months now, it's a serious upgrade to my first gen iphone that I was using but my only problems with this phone is that after only about 1 month my screen cracked at the bottom it was never dropped or set down hard it was unexplained I just woke up one morning and there was a crack its nothing major. The other problem was the audio speaker went out also the battery life is not good but I use Wi-Fi I heard that's why. All in all I really love this phone so far I am very happy I bought it and no contract!! You can't beat that for the price of this phone. Its really fast too."
Broke the 2nd day
"The i-Blason Galaxy Note 5 Case, Clip Holster Combo with Kickstand comes in two main parts: 1) Note 5 case with folding kickstand, and 2) Slide-in holster with belt clip.<br /><br />I will concentrate my review mostly on the case, as I will not be using the holster. The reason I stopped using holsters long ago is that my job requires physical labor - and in my past experience the holstered phone will always get caught/hooked on something and my expensive cell phone smart or not - will come flying off in a slow motion death crash!  I will say that when I tested the holster, the cased Note 5 slid in and out quite easily.<br /><br />The black case and holster are thin rigid plastic with an attractive but subtle texture design. I was attracted to this case mainly because of the option to use a stand.  I had another smart phone that had this feature built-in, and it was nice to use this when the need came up. The case fits nice and snug, snapping nicely around the Note 5. Instead of cut-out holes, (as used for the lens and light) to accommodate your volume and power buttons and plug-ins, there are open-sided cut arounds that work just fine. I prefer a more grip-pie soft feel that harder plastic feel, but it's not a deal breaker or anything - just my .02 cents.<br /><br />I like/dislike the KICKSTAND - it pulls out into position nicely using the 2 recessed indentations and snaps into locked position without much hassle. However, when you want to fold it flat, remember to use &#34;finesse&#34; as my normal (argh) gorilla pull tactic felt like I'd snap the stand in two. When the stand is used in horizontal or landscape position, the stand is off center axis and any slight push may knock your phone over.  Using the stand in the vertical or portrait position, the Note 5 feels a little more balanced as the stand is centered. As to be expected it is top-heavy using the vertical stand-up mode. As long as you are careful touching the screen, and using your other hand to support your phone the tip-over problem should be kept at the minimum.<br /><br />Pros:<br />&#62;Quality build, looks good<br />&#62;Case slides and rests easily into holster<br />&#62;Stand is very useful<br /><br />Cons:<br />&#62;Stand is not center balanced in horizontal/landscape position, may easily fall over<br />&#62;Stand snap back into flat position needs gentle touch<br /><br />This review is my opinion - and your experience can be totally different - depending on your applications. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I'll try to report back if updates are needed over the months ahead. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me and I'll try my best to answer in a timely manner.should be kept at the minimum.

Luv it!
"This thing crapped out really early and when I went to get my new one under warranty, the website wasn't even there. Don't buy"
Charging space is way to small and overheats if you are able to find that sweet spot and actually get your pho e to charge.
I drop my phone and the screen crack because there is no protection om the edges..... do not buy it cost me $600 for anew  phone
"didn't hold a charge from day one ,waist of time and money!"
For this great product I received an amazing promo code and all I did was write an review
The product was not as advertised.  It does't file the standard outlet for an American Vehicle
Very quality product love it thank u seller
"Really, really happy with this case, especially for the price paid. It slips on easily and stays on snugly, while still giving my iPhone that sleek feel. Love it!"
Great product fast shipping
Great simple case!
easy to snap right on to the flip phone and stays on fits perfectly
Excellent product .
"Still haven't smashed my phone yet...., Kick stand is Great..."
I've had this product for about three months.  The battery drains almost completely after a short phone call of 5 minutes.  It takes about 8 hours to charge it about 20 percent.  There are glitches and things don't seem to work right. Such as touching the screen and it is frozen or takes me to different applications.  I'll be in the middle of something and the screen goes black and it will restart.  Several more issues as well.  I'm not happy with this product.  It's not really reliable and I feel that it's a lemon.  Once it's bought and paid for nothing you can do. There's a 30 day window of return but if there's no chance to use the phone during that time your out of luck.
Great product
"Even by following the instructions very carefully,  the product ended up covered in bubbles, stretched areas,  and scratches.  Not even worth the trouble to return it.  I just threw it in the garbage,  where it belongs."
it was good
Great
Great device would recommend it
Very Well. Thx.
Really like this phone.
Bought this for my son's phone which was suggested to me from a friend.  Fits great and will protect the phone which belongs to a 13-year old.
Stopped working after a few uses
Great case.
"These are great Lightning to USB cable.  As good as the ones you get from Apple, but much cheaper."
"I Haven't tested the product fully (tested with a random usb/ac plug and it works) because I'm mainly going to use this as a charging cable when my Anker PowerDrive +1 comes in (taking longer to ship than cable). but already really really pleased with a few things:  1. Delivery was prompt (arrived on a Sunday & it was free!?!?)  2. Shipping packaging was standard yellow envelope but, the box the cable comes in was actually really nice for just a USB cable! I could tell this is going to be a quality cable by just judging the box!  3. For a USB cable its goregous looking the red nylon braid is pretty sick and will look nice (and be easy to find) in my car.  4. Superb build quality! Feels sturdy and  extremely premium! Fits extremely snug in my Note Edge!  I will boost rating to five stars when the PowerDrive comes in and if it can carry the Quick Charge 2.0 amperage."
"My set arrived with 2 plates missing the stickies.  Not that big of deal, but this is not my first purchase of these type of magnet holders.  One thing to keep in mind, it will mess with your wireless charging capability (the plate interferes).  To work around the Note 4 wireless charging back, I put the metal plate inside the back cover below the contacts so it doesn't short out.  The bulging isn't noticeable with a case on.  As for the Note 5, the phone is metal and actually doesn't require a metal tab; however, once you put a case on it won't hold.  I purchased a Spigen case and put the tab between the rubber case and the shell behind the kickstand.  Wireless charging works with a decent charger, but not a cheap one.  Like instructed, don't pull or slide, but tilt it off and on; it stays put for me.  One recommendation would be to allow the back to be removed and provide a sticky to fasten the magnet directly onto something."
Doesn't fit properly
"Worked perfectly. Really blown away by how fast I got it, how easy it was to install and how well it works"
Great!
"I ordered the grey one, but it came gold.  And I actually really like it better.  I also didn't realize it had the screen cover, but I really like that too.  Especially that you can answer the phone without opening it.  Nice, durable, and it looks great."
"I received my items fast and it was unfortunate that I had received a bad battery but after contacting the company and telling them about my issue, they were more than willing to send me a new battery. These batteries have been a life saver to me and I would definitely recommend it."
These suck... don't buy them. Mine stopped working within a week... waste of money
"Excellent case! I have dropped my phone quite a few times in this and my phone is still like new! A little dirty around the edges, but still looks nice and protects my phone, which is my main purpose of using this case!"
"My first Tile died. This was a replacement. It could have a louder sound, but at least the GPS was very accurate."
"The seller was on top of things without even initiating communicating with them. Sellers such as those you appreciate when they check in after the purchase. In addition, selling a nice case (firm texture and tight fit) at such an affordable price, plus 2 day shipping? You can't ask for more."
Quick Charge 2.0 Wall Charger really changes my phones and ipad very quickly.  I am not sure how I ever lived without it.  I use it non stop with work.  I received this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion which I am giving.  I love how simple this is to plug in and start charging your phone.  Because I often work on my phone day in and day out I have to keep it always charged.
Awesome! Works great with my Lumia 920.
Phone fits Tight and sung
"Great phone, greater price. 10/10 would get phone again"
"Perfect if you have this phone and want quick access to it. Used it during courier work. Durable, easily to put on/take off, easy to remove phone from it and put it back in. I did NOT use the phone cover with it, so the phone just slid right on it. Kept phone from getting dropped, scratched, etc. Good product."
Very HAPPY with my case. Just what I expected
The product looks sharp and works well.
Great screen protector!
Worked out good and liked the screen protector
"I would have given this item NO stars. First of all they are NOT Apple, they look more like something you find at the dollar store, so cheap and not sturdy."
It didnt last a year as a car charger!
it slips out of my belt!!! almost lost my cell phone!!!
poor quality
"It fits the phone well and the rubber sides do not easily bend back - I have the clear one which is actually a little bit different model than the colored ones. However, after several weeks the sides turned a brownish color, which is not very attractive. After about 6 months it bothered me too much and I purchased a different case (leather one from Apple - love it). Also, the back is not scratch resistant like it says - it is plastic after all so I never expected it to resist scratches. Overall, the case protects well, especially for the price. But if you get the all clear just know it will change over time."
"So excited to take this with me to my company's convention.  I have used it multiple times already and know my battery will drain in a big arena with thousands of people, so I was looking for something like this to help with charging.  The last convention everyone was scrambling trying to find somewhere to charge their phones.  This has already saved me multiple times. Love it!"
"Only two of three lens came, and of course, the lens I wanted (the macro) was the one that didn't arrive."
"I love this CD mount. It is perfect placement to take hands free calls or use the GPS for navigation. It is sturdy and supports my iphone 6 well.  I do have a case on my iphone and if the case was any bigger, like a big Otterbox, then it would not fit. That would be my only complaint is that it almost doesn't fit completely into the pocket of the device, but it stays in place considering. My CD player doesn't work so its just as well that this stays in it regularly. I would recommend it if you are looking for a mount for the car that is easily accessible and good quality."
Break pretty easily but you get more than enough to get the job done.
Great!
I love it! It's pink & pretty
Cords work great have no complaints.
"I just got this handy little guy to throw in my purse. As I am handicapped with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, I depend on my iPhone and iPad now for everything. I'm so glad I don't have to worry about the battery dying in a dr's appointment!!!"
It's as if I don't have a privacy screen at all. People can still see what I'm doing on my phone. Not very happy with it
cool on hand
[[VIDEOID:1777300240a889680a90b3b900285cb4]]
good
Perfect
"I bought 6 pairs of radios to use in my business, the radios are well built except for the belt clip, that is too small and easy to brake.<br />My biggest dissapointment is with the clarity of the voice, it is extremely hard to understand anything the other person is saying, much less with the surveillance headset PTT mic, I am really dissapinted with Motorola."
Nice and slim. Sturdy
"Great product, affordable price, meets all  expectations, comparatively user friendly."
Quality product
Case was for my daughter and she is very happy with it!
"I used it only several times, the thing broke into two pieces at the joint of the bottom. Not good."
"This is really good carpet.  Much thicker and more durable than expected.  Used it for vehicle interior restoration.  Works great for spray adhesive mounting to MDF panels, easy to work around complex shapes and the results are amazing (lots of attention at car shows).  If I need more, I am going straight to this stuff."
Great thought however it doesn't fit perfectly. I had to use pliers to remove from my phone.
"These fit fine, and we were able to finally get all the bubbles out, however, there's a sticker on the front of the screen protector and when you peel it off, it leaves sticky residue that we tried really hard to get off. We tried 3 protectors and over an hour of trying to clean it off but it was still sticky and discolored in those areas. We ended up having to peel the covers off so it was a waste of money. The product was cheap but I wish we hadn't wasted multiple dollars on shipping for something so useless."
What a terribly messy product with excessively complicated application. Buy the new &#34;glass&#34; screen protector instead. This is not a good alternative.
"Hi,<br /><br />This is my review of the product listed on Amazon as:<br /><br />IPhone Case, IPhone 6 Case - TURATA Premium Handmade Bling Crystal Diamonds Sweet Love Blowing Dandelion Brushed Metal Design Back Case Cover for IPhone 6 (4.7&#34;)(Value Package)<br /><br />I received this product a few weeks ago and had time yesterday to evaluate it for a detailed review.  I have also included several photos that I took of the cases and accessories in use for anyone who is interested.<br /><br />This is for all current colors: Red, Blue, Pink, Grey, and Gold<br /><br />UNBOXING AND OBSERVATIONS:<br /><br />What’s great about this product from TURATA is that they do a really good job with the packaging.  I mean, really good.  I’ve had phone cases come in from other brands and all they give is a simple white box with their logo and the case inside.  Here, with TURATA, you get a pretty welcoming experience.<br /><br />First the box comes wrapped in a candy like wrapper package to make it feel like a gift.<br /><br />Upon opening that wrap, there’s the dark purple wavy design pattern on the gift box with the TURATA logo and website on the bottom of the top lid of the box.<br /><br />When you open up the lid, what you’ll find is behind the lid is a company message to the owner of the product edged in gold coloring with thanks and appreciation.  An e-mail address is provided.<br /><br />In the holding box, there’s the stainless steel stylus pen with rubber tip, a packaged dust plug, and a TURATA tan colored pouch that’s folded up to fit the box with the TURARA logo again.  Inside the pouch is where the phone case is located.<br /><br />So overall, with the packaging, I was impressed how delicate and premium it felt for them to spend so much time with the packaging and boxing to make it a great welcoming experience.<br /><br />I haven’t seen other brands do this with their cell phone cases when I get them delivered from Amazon.  So they get points for that.<br /><br />In looking at the stylus pen, I thought it looked nice at first.  It is smooth and comfortable to hold based on its curved design.  I tested the rubber tip on my phone and it was responsive and didn’t have much of any issues.  The problem I had that I didn’t like about the stylus pen was that it rolls around too easily.  If you put it on a glass table top surface, it’s going to keep rolling until it hits something to stop it on the table or it will fall off the table onto the ground with a lot of noise from impact.  I didn’t like this design too much.  What I suggest and prefer is if TURATA keeps a similar design of this, but adds a silicon layer coating over some part of this stylus pen to give it some resistance and friction to any table top surface that you put it on so that it will hold still.  Also, if this could include a clip on component to it to clip onto shirt pockets and other things, that would be great too.  Otherwise, just simply putting the current form of this stylus pen into your pocket will do, but will also cause the rubber tip to attract dust.<br />The dust plug has a nice design to it.  Both the phone case “Bling” and dust plug “Bling” are really Rhinestones.  And that makes sense because they can’t sell a $10 phone case with real diamonds or premium crystals.  Otherwise, they’d go out of business.  But these do look nice as is, not only for kids and teenagers, but for older women as well.  Because of the elegant styling of the dust plug and phone case design, I don’t recommend this for men.  This is purely intended for the female audience to enjoy.  So feel free to get this for your lady friends, cousin, niece, sister, aunt, mom, or grandma.<br /><br />Each dust plug has a different design to it.  They each have two larger crystals that complement the color of the case.  So Blue case will have blue crystals on the dust plug, and so forth.  It’s a good color matching pattern that is separate for each phone color case that you get from TURATA.  It’s good to take a picture of them when you get them to not lose track of which dust plug for which phone case it goes to.  Some dust plugs have a large Eiffel tower piece attached to it by itself.  Others have a long necklace type of design with smaller crystals looping around followed by a smaller Eiffel tower piece.  The plug is a plastic material, which I don’t like as much.  I would’ve liked seeing a more harder and firm gripping material when plugged into the audio port of your phone to keep it held in more easily and resist from tugging on it.  That’s what I provide as a suggestion.  Perhaps stainless steel would be good.<br /><br />The phone cases each have a nice artwork design etched onto the case.  The case is fairly rough the way it was printed, likely from a 3D printer.  When I feel around it with my fingers, I feel the white horizontal line patterns throughout the case, from the interior.  They won’t scratch up your phone, but it does feel sort of rough.<br /><br />The exterior of the phone case has a nice smooth polish and is reflective where you look at it from the source of light.  This is reflective even without having the light hit the rhinestones.  Some people like it.  That glossy look does bring the color and the etched design out more.<br /><br />The artwork is of a boy and girl with a love symbol floating on top of the girl near some large and small dandelions.  The color of the case that you get from TURARA has the color noticeable on the first half of the case towards the bottom.  It fades towards a transparent coating on the way up.  This is important to know because some phones have a colored backing already on them, such as gold, space grey, or silver, and depending on what color case that you get, some cases look better once installed on one colored phone, but the same can’t be said if you take those same case colors that you liked and installed it on another phone colored backing.<br /><br />So for my evaluation and review, I had with me my iPhone 6 Gold colored phone to compare between the 5 colors for that gold backing.  For the other iPhone 6 colors, I suggest trying to find someone else who may reviewed and showed photos of it.<br /><br />USAGE:<br /><br />Installing the case was simple  I just aimed at an angle to tuck in the corner with the rear camera lens in first to fit the hole carved out for it, then placed the rest of the phone down into the case and pushed in have a snapping sound.  The case is flexible and bendable along the edges, which makes it more easy to install and not that difficult to remove.  To remove the case, I recommend going from the bottom corner of the case and aim at the corner to pry with your fingers while putting grip with your other finder into the power port of your iPhone.  Then continue to pull along that same side, which will detach the phone from the top corner and then the rest will come off.<br /><br />Each colored case, I installed it and took photos of how it looked indoors with certain levels of lighting coming in compared to going outdoors.  These photos were taken between 1pm to 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon, when the sun had come out.<br /><br />I’m going to go through each color and give my opinion and ranking.<br /><br />Blue case:<br /><br />When taking the blue case out of the yellow pouch, I thought to myself that this blue is a little too light of a color to fit in well with a gold background, even when looking at the pouch that was a tanned color rather than a gold color of my iPhone 6.  It doesn’t stand out due to the light Teal color.  I would’ve suggested a darker blue to have a good level of contrast between that and other colors.  And maybe it’s because of the gold.  If it was space grey or silver for the iPhone 6, maybe it would look better?<br /><br />When putting it into my hand, the edges of the bottom half of the case could be seen well with the Teal blue color.  The center of thebottom region of the case has a higher transparent mesh of the teal and the color of my hand behind it.<br /><br />When installing the iPhone 6 case onto it with the dust plug, it gave it a more light transition of blue into the gold backing of the phone.  The color had a more washed out soft touch looking appearance towards the bottom half below the large dandelion.  With indoor lighting, this looked sort of OK.  But I saw more clearly in the transparency than the blue that I think people would want to buy the case for.  The edges were more vivid in the teal color blue.  Up close, you can see the white etched streak marks across every part of the phone case.  I’m not sure if that’s by design or not.  The dust plug does look nice with this colored case.<br /><br />When taking it outdoors into the bright sunlight, the blue that could be seen did not look really good with this gold backing.  There just wasn’t enough of the color there to really want to stand out well.  The soft touch may look OK within an indoors setting, but outdoors in the sunlight, it doesn’t look good.  In the outdoor shade, it has an OK look with the soft touch of the blue focused more on the boy and girl etched image.<br /><br />I wouldn’t recommend this case for the gold backing of the iPhone 6.<br /><br />Grey case:<br /><br />The grey case has a darker tone to it under the tan colored pouch.  When raising the case up with my hand, it has a more classical drawn and illustrated look to it.  The gray you could see well from the pouch and holding it up with your hand.  However, when you install it on the phone with a gold colored backing, it has a different look of positive or negative depending on which angle you’re holding it.  In the indoor lighting, holding it at certain angles with the reflection of the lighting hitting it didn’t make the gray stand out enough to look good.  When I avoided some of the glaring reflection indoors, the gray color looked better for the etched design around the boy and girl.  It did give the overall look from gold on top to gray on the bottom a strange look.  I’d say you’d get more looks with this colored case indoors than the blue one that I looked at earlier.<br /><br />In the outdoor shade, the colored case didn’t look too well from how I saw it through the photo.  However, in direct sunlight, it looked a little better.<br /><br />Overall, I’d rank the grey case better than the blue case, for a gold colored iPhone 6<br /><br />Red case:<br /><br />The red case from TURATA when looking at it for the first time had a nice look to it.  It’s like a more champagne red color.  It had a more deep tone in the color than the other colored cases observed.  And while I was evaluating this, I found it looked better with the thicker depth of the color onto the case.<br /><br />When installing this case on the gold backing of an iPhone 6, this looked really nice in the indoor lighting setting.  The gold that goes through the white streaked transparency of the phone case on top has a nice looking transition at the center as it goes into the red coloring towards the bottom.  It actually complements the artwork very well, with the love or affection in the red and the dimmer gold tone for the brightness of a sky appearance on the case.<br /><br />In the outdoor shade, the red stood out well with the gold that dimmers a little and had a nice overall experience.  Even in bright direct sunlight it had a nice look to it where the red darkened out well.<br /><br />I like this colored case for this iPhone 6 gold backing and I would recommend it.<br /><br />So far, I’d rank them as the following:<br /><br />1) Red<br />2) Grey<br />3) Blue<br /><br />Gold case:<br /><br />The gold colored case in front of the tanned colored pouch made it hard to see much of any difference.  Holding it with my hand made the gold look so washed out and transparent that I saw more of the white streak lines more than anything.<br /><br />However, when installing it onto my iPhone 6 case, the gold on the case was slightly more noticeable because it was darker in the bottom half than the top half, which had the gold backing of the iPhone seen through it.  It has a very smooth transition and because it’s gold on gold of different coated layers, it’s almost better than a clear case, but hard to tell from clear case, if you know what I mean.  In the indoor lighting, I could see the dark to lighter gold transition more easily.<br /><br />However, outdoors, in the shade for example, I wasn’t able to tell the gold color of the casing at all.  In the bright sunlight, the darker shade of gold on the case was barely noticeable.  I think this sort of faded, hard to tell look, reminded me the same way when I evaluated the blue colored case.  I didn’t like neither of them because what is the purpose of buying a colored case when you can barely see it in the light?<br /><br />So to rank these again, I’d put the gold better than the blue just because of a nice looking transition in the indoor lighting, but I wouldn’t recommend it for the gold colored backing of the case.<br /><br />Ranking:<br /><br />1) Red<br />2) Gray<br />3) Gold<br />4) Blue<br /><br />The last color for the evaluation is:<br /><br />Pink:<br /><br />The pink color had a washed out look to it that is a mixed feeling between the blue case and the gold case.  It’s not clearly visible even while in front of the tannish colored pouch.  In my hand, it wasn’t as clearly visible with the pink.  It was a very light touch of a coating onto the case.  When installing it on the Gold iPhone, it had a very light touch and transition from how light the gold looks on the top and towards the bottom, the light and dim tone of the pink.  It doesn’t really stand out at all, and if that’s your intention is to give it a color mixture that doesn’t stand out a lot, then this case is for you.  Oddly, the way that you hold the angle of the iPhone with this case installed, the pink can come out a little more vivid than when you’re looking straight into it with some glare from the polish the case has.<br /><br />Outdoors in the shade, the pink was faded and had a dull look to it.  This was the same observance in direct sunlight.  In direct sunlight, you can see the mild transition from pink to gold, but it’s a very light touch.  Personally for me, I like colors that stand out, so it’s a user preference.<br /><br />I would not recommend this color for a gold backing iPhone 6.<br /><br />So after evaluating the colors available, I rank them as follows:<br /><br />1) Red<br />2) Grey<br />3) Pink<br />4) Gold<br />5) Blue<br /><br />What’s good to know about these cases is that they have cutout holes for all buttons on the iPhone 6, including the volume buttons, sleep wake button, and the silence button.<br /><br />What’s missing that I suggest TURATA improves upon is adding depth in the front so that if the phone were to fall and land face first, then it would be very critical to avoid damage if the case could absorb the impact.  Having the front of the case curve out in the front and add up to 1/8th of an inch of thickness all around would help.  Otherwise, users will need to buy a tempered glass screen protector to protect the front of their iPhone because this current design case does not offer that protection.<br /><br />IN SUMMARY:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1) Premium gift wrapped packaging<br />2) Pretty artwork etched in that has a nice look and feel<br />3) Smooth exterior with added gloss that makes it looks and feels nice<br />4) Rhinestones offer a gleaming shimmer effect under the sun<br />5) Wide selection of colored cases to tailor for different colored phones<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1) Stylus Pen rolls around too easily uncontrollably on smooth surfaces<br />2) Case does not protect the front of the phone from drops and impacts<br />3) Some colors have a faded dull appearance whentaken outdoors or under certain reflective indoor lighting that does not look good for the iPhone color backing<br /><br />SUGGESTIONS:<br /><br />1) Redesign the side of the TURATA case mold so that wraps over to the front side and adds from depth of coverage.  About 1/8th inch should be sufficient all around the front edges<br />2) Provide a silicon portion on at least one portion of the stylus end or handle to provide more friction and act as a stopper from rolling around on smooth tabletop surface<br />3) Replace the plastic molding for the dust plug with a stronger alternative that holds better<br /><br />USAGE:<br /><br />This product would be good for people who:<br /><br />1) Want to have a flashy design for a cell phone case<br />2) Are in relationships<br />3) Want to present this as a gift to a lady for friendship or relationship matters<br />4) Want an attractive case that symbolizes who they are and what they’re about<br /><br />Overall, I think these cases are nice for women of all ages.  Couples can pair themselves with these cases as well, but it appears the etching and bling is more for the feminine side.  I was blown away by the packaging material after having gone through so many previous phone case orders with other brands and seeing how the boxing and wrapping was meant to be discarded right away.<br /><br />These case selections for your phone should be considered based on the type of iPhone you have because each of them have one of three different colored backings with will make the overall selection and preference from each other different in the overall look and appeal.<br /><br />I received samples of this product from the manufacturer to help give a detailed review of the user experience and how to improve the product.  This review is to also help with prospective buyers make smart, informed decisions based on the information available to them.<br /><br />I hope my photos were helpful.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.gn around the boy and girl.

Nice head unit with a lot of features.  The RMX11M wired remote is a nice addition.
"Perfect! I bought this as a birthday present and she loved it! Fits perfect, looks good!"
beautiful
"My phone, and lg g3 doesn't fit with the case on. Description says it will fit but that is not true. My case is not large but it still won't fit.  I wouldn't recommend this item."
It's ok
"I love UAG cases.  Had one for the S5 and now this one, certainly my favorite.  It's protective, but not a safe like an otterbox.  It's stylish if you like the &#34;industrial&#34; look of screws and such, it's thin, and it grips.<br /><br />Not a fan of the crap screen shields they send with the cases, though, but I certainly don't feel like they're adding unnecessary cost to the purchase."
Very good protection. A little hard to put on and not moveable if it is not lined up
This charger does not work. I will have to return it.
I have a iPhone 6 plus I used this cord about 15 times and it's now saying my cable not compatible with this cord..😕😕😕. So I would not recommend this cord for a iPhone six plus and I have a iPad Air a Two same thing won't work I'm always looking for the best cords for my phone and this is not one.
"Great cable! Sturdy and secure, The color is black so it doesn't blend in with all my other white cables and being so long, I can use my device and charge it at the same time. Thick wire doesn't get tangles at all and easy to wind up."
very long lasting charge...thumbs up
"horrible quality, very disappointed in this. Donated to good will"
"Excellent protector. Against drops, bumps and misuses always protect the most . !"
"Great case,good price"
Nice
Poor quality and not worth the money.  I feels like cardboard.  The only reason I am not returning it is that it will cost me $6 for shipping so I am only getting $3 refund.  I do not know how this product got so many 5-stars.
Great all the way around...
The six foot Anker cable is well made and should give years of service. Great price for it and the packaging for it is good considering it's just a cable.
After installing I put pressure on the corner to make sure it had a solid fit and it cracked. Must be paper thin glass....
Works and fit Sylvania DVD PLAYER
GREAT ITEM
Easy to install...no fuss...no bubbles
"I bought this for my boat. So cool. The power never stops when I unug my shore power it automatically switches to inverter. It powers my fridge, a/c & TV no problems. Highly recommended."
"Very nice,love that you can put your  license in that secret slot."
"Great cords!! 10ft cords for this price? And they all work just fine, will buy these again!"
all good
Works great although the rubber handle slides a lot.
I have had one before and I like this product
Yeah
"After fully charged it only lasts 1/2 a day before it needs charging again. Would not refer a person to buy this product, am in the process of requesting a full refund"
I have been searching for a protector for my new samsung galexy note 3 I am getting on the 1st and this one looks great read over other reviews and believe I've made a decision :)
I love being able to have a spare battery on hard.  Lighter than carrying around a portable charger and cable.
Fast shipping. Love the colors.
Good charger and speed i used it in lg g flex 1 and flex 2
It works as intended.
"For the price it was the exact quality I'd expect. Looks good, fits great. Excited to how long it will last!"
"Gives my phone that same iPhone modern look but is unique, lots of compliments already."
Works as promised. Amazing charger!
"Good tracker. Like the steps, the sleep, and the tips. Not impressed with the food tracker, not easy to use. Had weight watchers tracker, hoped to use this instead.  So far it's been disappointing in that aspect."
"I love this case, with one reservation: It is not convenient for holding cash. Bills must be folded more than once, and then they're too thick to insert into the case. However, other cases aren't any better in this regard, and this is the most aesthetically pleasing case I've seen offered."
"What you see is what you get.  Three excellent USB to charge any apple device.  I used one for myself and then the other two will be given to coworkers of mine.  The length of the cord is perfect and is exactly like the one that is given to you when you first buy and iPhone.  This is perfect to keep in the car or to have an extra around the house.<br />Definitely worth the purchase!!<br /><br />I reviewed this item in return for writing a review,"
"I wanted a clear case with a nice design for my iPhone 6. After browsing for a few hours, I decided to buy this one. I was pleasantly surprised to receive the product 1 or 2 days earlier than scheduled. I can even say that the case it's a lot nicer than I expected to be.<br /> Highly recommended it!"
Great product. Holds up to my 16yr old :)
Great for every day use
GREAT easy to install good directions easy to clean<br />Thanks Gil Giuliani
I like it.... very happy with this purchase since the cost is 1/3 of the Canadian cost (Can$25.00 + 13% tax)
Worked great!
Excellent!! Love !!
"Simplifies family or work travel, plus have it by my favorite chair at home to top up all the family gadgets."
Great product lasts forever with the charge.  I was amazed to have used it a few times and did not need to charge it until the fifth time I charged my phone.  Very pleased with the product.
Great product. It's everything I expected and love it. Went on easy and effortlessly. 2-pack is great Price can't be beat. Highly recommend
Great price and excellent service.
"My iPad Air immediately didn't like this cord.  Out of the package, these cords looked impressive with a cool nylon braid inside a plastic outer covering...  I was immediately optimistic, but unfortunately it was an immediate disappointment.  It would barely trickle a charge to the iPad...  As in after 8-10 hours it was still only 70% charged.<br /><br />Within a few days, the bits comprising the plug head itself (the part that plugs into the tablet) so that then the cord had to be resting just so in order to work at all...  Needless to say I returned it to Amazon and spent a couple bucks more for an Anker brand cord which has performed flawlessly.<br /><br />In defense of this cord, it does come a 2-pack.  When the first one failed, I just returned the pair and never tried using the second one.  Perhaps they are so cheap to make in China that they just provide two rather than having quality control at the factory!  Although the second cord could have been fine, based on my experiences with the other one, I would absolutely not recommend this product."
Hard to get to work. Sent back!
our kids love this product. no more dead phones
Compact and solid. Easy to handle.
This item got deliverd fast . and was the right part i have order parts befor and it was not at all what it said the description but this was not he case fast and the right part i am happy
No NFC = no flagship
Screen didn't work.
Love it.
My order came in promptly  and very happy with the purchase.
"I just got my Otterbox Commuter case for my iPhone 6+, and I'm very happy with it. The case is strong and sturdy, and I know my case is protected. One little thing I didn't like is the fact that I couldn't keep my tempered glass screen protector, and had to use the one they provided with it because the glass protector makes the phone thicker by a sliver, therefore making it hard to insert the phone in. This case does not have a installed screen protector like the Defender series but like I said they provide a screen protector that comes layers with two guide films to set it in place. I'm so glad I got this case because not only is thin unlike the Defender, but it's sturdy enough to protect the phone from bumps, drops, dust and scratches. I highly recommend this case, and I'm glad I ordered it. The seller is super fast in shipping the items, and the quality and workmanship of each product is epic. The cases are 100% genuine Otterbox, and they come in original retail packaging. This is really an amazing Otterbox case to enjoy and be proud of. Thank you. :-)"
"This review is for: Car Charger, Benks 3 Ports USB 5.5 Amp (2.4a 2.1a 1a) Smart Universal High Capacity in black<br /><br />I received a sample for my honest review.<br /><br />This charger is very compact so it does not protrude too much from the port. With three ports, we can keep all our electronics charged up on the go without fights in our van. This charges our iphones and ipods quickly without any connection problems. It feels well made and sturdy.<br /><br />No problems so far."
had my phone in this and it still broke
Great cell phone case. Very good quality and fits the phone perfectly!
"i absolutely love this! its so soft! and my phone fits it perfectly! plus i dont have to carry my big ol purse, just stick the cards  use in the side pockets! it works great. i just throw it on the side of my baby diaper bag now so its so much easier to carry! thank you for making this a review product!"
very satisfied
Very easy to apply.  Clear instructions.  All tools needed are included.  Adheres by itself with no bubbles
"bad screen ,slow to touch ,faded colors started getting spots in screen after cpl weeks"
Product just as advertised. Great merchant
Ordered this case for my phone and very happy with the product....will order again from this company. ....
I love this screen protector! I've already dropped my phone several times without any scratches or nicks!
Very comfortable and easy to use.
it was fully charged and i used up all the juice. my phone went from 14 to 87% I think it was. so not fully charged but better than dead and stuck.  does have a handy bag to keep it in in my purse
good product
My wife loves this case and it makes her feel safe using her phone. She loves how it feels in her hands too.
Great speakers for the price.  Easy to install into my '15 Tacoma and sounds pretty good.  I would buy them again
Worst Case I Ever Bought ! Bad Print And Its Cut Horribly.
"Top port stopped working after 45 days. Too late to return.<br /><br />Review update: Anker support reached out and offered trouble-shooting solutions. P.S. I like the upgrade of this model better than the 24W 2-port usb wall charger.  If you are debating, get the 24w!"
Give a four star FOR NOW ... BUT OVER ALL EXCELLENT (in Mr. Burns voice off the Simpson's) the package came LITERALLY in one week. Bought it on 23rd thurs. got it 29th Friday
I'm having mixed reviews about this battery one day it gives me 1 day an 10 hrs of use then the next 9 hrs of use I have to remove the battery after charging to get accurate reading I shouldn't have to remove the case then the battery every time I charge the thing it's giving me a headache I'm thinking of returning the battery and going back to my old battery and carrying around a charger this battery cost to much to have to go through that every time I charge it
"Slim, lightweight and very easy to grip. Perfect for lightweight and light duty protection."
"I've had a few Trident cases as I've changed phones along with purchasing ones for my husband.  They are all fantastic.  I've had many cases from the phone carrier store made by different companies that break when dropped or aren't secure.  These are ALWAYS secure, and I have never had an issue with it not protecting my phone when I drop it (or even if I get liquid on it too.)  The rubber with the hard plastic is a great design and very protective.  It's clearly made for people like me who drop their phone all the time because I'm klutzy.  The prices are always very reasonable, which is a plus.<br />It definitely adds some bulk to your phone, but does it in a way that makes you feel like you could throw it against the wall and it would be secure. (Don't do this though.)"
"Holds the phone fine evan with an Otter Box.  Secure, the phone never falls out"
muy bien
Why the heck didn't I buy this sooner
I hate it
"Crap product, I took my brand new phone out of the box, never touched the screen, cleaned with enclosed wet cloth then with enclosed micro fiber cloth, and it still won't stick in upper and lower right corners no matter how much I press on it ."
"I love my iPhone 6, so, I have to keep it protected.  This case offers protection while being cute. It is a two layer case. One layer is a pink silicone protector and the other layer is a plastic protector. I love this case. It comes with a clip that your phone slips down in. I am very pleased with the quality of the case. It does not make my phone feel bulky. I also own the black on black case. I love them both! I received the cases in exchange for my honest review."
"Product in good condition, just as advertised - thanks!"
"Just purchased this item, and it works great! Very slim so it's not bulky in my car.  The clarity is great.  Sound is clear.  Seems to be exactly what I was looking for!"
"If you value your phone or the price you paid for it, this case WILL not protect it very well.  Pretty cheaply made and doesn't seem like it will stay in one piece for very long."
Great product! Just as described.
Works great
I thought it was a privacy protector but people can still see my screen so I'm not satisfied with it
I love this case.  This the 2nd one I have.  1st was for my note 4 and now for my note 5.
Love these  stylus pens.Use them on my tablet and phone always.
"Very good, works great"
Works very well
"I drop my phone so often that that alone is enough to make this case worth every penny. I also make body products, love to cook, and love the outdoors. In every scenario I have spilled something on it, or it starts raining, or whatever. You don't have to stress about your phone getting jacked up. I had one of these on my iPhone 4s for 3 years with tons of wear before the rubber started to come apart, so I bought one when I got my new phone!"
Perfect
Out of the box the right speaker output was dead.
Great case. Fits really well and comes with screen protector. I like the design and even though case is only a bumper all the buttons work perfectly. My phone color is Gold so it matches prefect. I am very happy to get this at discount price.
"Tempered glass had a indent in it, causing bubble :("
Excellent Thank You..
Holes don't match exactly
"This does a great job at holding your device your way.  I chose dashboard mounted and took the advice of other reviews and used the supplied  little disk as a base. The method it uses to lock and unlock the device from its &#34;claw&#34; is outstanding. It's a little ugly, but who isn't!"
My wife loves these. I guess it's saved her screen when she dropped her phone.
"Works flawlessly, very satisfied with this product! I was skeptical to purchase after the nightmare the old school FM transmitters were, not any more... the iClever proves that it can be done right... if you are on the fence I strongly encourage you to make the purchase, great gadget at an awesome price!"
Thus phone is unbelievable
Worked as advertised. Nice to have a choice of wind-shield or air vent.
EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
"G-Hub - This OnePlus ONE Screen Display Case with built in stand arrived neatly packaged in a cellophane bag which enabled great visibilty of the product.<br />With a black textured cover, this horizontal flip style case comes with an integrated viewing stand. A great feature of this product, is that the cover houses two windows which are strategically placed allowing the user to see who is calling as well as accepting or declining the call without having to open the case.<br />In comparison to other flip style cases this is easy to use, incoming calls that are easily accessible with a modern clean exterior. A fantastic affordable product"
Does not have a kickstand like advertised
I've had this case for about a month and it has been great so far! Really happy with this product.
"It's a good product. I do wish you could more easily use the touch screen on my phone when it's in the case,  but so far the case keeps my phone dry :)"
"This works great for hiking, running etc...great price, and delivery timing"
Works great!
Worked great & fit perfectly! Great find for the price!
This case fits my sons moto G perfectly. The cutouts are lined up exactly with all of the ports unbutton and the raised edges around the screen help to protect that from getting scratched or cracked. Kids are so hard on their phones and it's nice to know so with this case I'm getting enough protection that I won't have to be buying a brand new phone here in just a few more months. It's inevitable that it's going to be dropped and that's why I knew I had to get a case with good protection. I have another case by this brand that I personally use on my LG g4 and it's fantastic.  I love their prices and the peace of mind I get knowing my phone id's safe. The cases are lightweight and do not add all kinds of crazy bulk to the designs of our phones yet still manage to offer great protection from accidental drops and bang ups. I am extremely impressed and pleased with the performance of these phone cases and would not hesitate to buy other cases from them. I did receive this case free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes however my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinion of this brand and their case.
Perfect for keeping my cell phone charged
Perfect fit
thanks
love it
The Case broke in 10 days
"Like the material, however the Velcro straps are too short."
It is working perfect.
"Case discolors and scratches easily. Okay protection, but much better options out there for the price."
Excellent service & really worth the money.  This gadget delivered everything it promised
"Fits the phone perfect,nice clear picture of elvis"
Weight of phone drags down vent. In my van it gave me no angle to see it reasonably. Returned
Just what you expect it is. O_O
With 4.8a this charger does its job!
"Great deal.  Purchased 3.  Only possible negative is that when running, slight rattle coming from the volume button.  Other than that, great sound."
Really awesome and really easy to use.highly recommended.
"Should have listened to the poor reviews on this item. Did not work from the first attempt. Dont waste your time or money, please."
EXCELLENT VALUE - easy to install and functions perfectly
Perfect stand.  The iPhone charger is adjustable and can accommodate most cases. Watch sits nicely on the stand.  The fit and finish are great. Highly recommend.
"Echoes, charger flap first stay shut"
"The elastic plastic front is subpar. It has the feel and dirt attraction similar to a kids rubberized toy. It probably will keep your phone protected, but I wasn't willing to test it."
Works great
The cord still works but I can see it cracks on the cord from where the cord would finally give up and stop working. I expected amazon to make better products. I have had this for a little more than 4 months.<br />Amazon Please let me know if I can return or get a replacement. Thanks.
The cable works great and was what I had hoped and expected.  Great product.  No complaints.
Play Ball!!!! Pretty cool case!
It doesn't last more than 2 weeks. The exact time that i can't return it.  This is my fifth and last.
It didn't work for my Zune device but the cable looked pretty new to me.
"This is the second screen protector I am buying for OnePlus One. The first one was from OnePlus itself. This one does not have a cutout for the camera which means that it might distort the image slightly, but at least it protects the camera too. Also this is much smoother both in the edges and the cutout. Finally I really enjoy the oleophobic coating, since it makes it easier to type on and keeps fingerprints away. For now I will only give 4 starts, since I only have it for a few days. If it lasts more than two months without any damage it will get 5 starts!    UPDATE: This screen protector proved to be way worse than it seemed... I dropped my phone the other day and even though the protector barely got damaged, my screen was completely shattered..."
Exactly what it says it is. Great price. Shipping took a while but not too long and that is what's stated. Have ordered 2 from here and would again.
"Not just colorful, but it works....great price"
"5 stars all day long!! Dropped it as soon as I put it on my phone, nothing, perfect! All the buttons and switches work and my signal is BETTER with the case on then off. Best investment I have ever made in a case, any brand, any material. Thank you for making such a awesome case. The only issue I have is sometimes it's hard to touch with the thick glass but I adapted to it."
Great way to store headset !! plus it charges !! COOL
If you have some USB devices that you utilize in your car then you need this.
"At 14.0 ounces and 2.5” X 2.5” X 7” this is one powerhouse of a Bluetooth speaker.  The sound is driven by two 5-watt speaker (not the usual three) with a (vibrating diaphragm) subwoofer.  The sound is just fantastic.  The functions are on the top and include a button for a light (it’s very bright), Volume Up/Fast Forward, Volume Down/Reverse and Play/Pause.  On the back side is a rubber flap that covers an auxiliary 3.5mm input for a cable, a TP Card insert (for your own songs on a card), an input USB for powering up and  the On/Off witch.  It pairs immediately with a triple beep.  It is definitely water resistant, but I would never place in underwater for more than a few seconds.  It could fall into a pool and survive if caught, but very few Bluetooth speakers are completely waterproof.  Still it’s in the proper price range for the sound quality.  Product supplied for review."
Lightning fast shipping!!! product as promised!! THANK YOU
It won't fit my iPhone 6 plus.
This is a beautiful case that looks very elegant. I've had no issues with it and I would definitely recommend this brand to my friends.
Great battery case recharges phone for more than one full charge.  Does not sync in battery case. Good protection as a case also.
"It's a cool bumper, but it doesn't really protect the phone.  It also broke quickly."
"Tight fit for my Droid Ultra but it works even with the case on! Very comfortable fit, stays secure."
"if you dont allready know, you should never buy apple lightning cables, and if your apple cable hasn't broken yet, it will.  this three pack of cables gets the job done without requiring you being gentle with them.<br />pros:  fits in iphone 5/5s Fre lifeproof case (not sure about iphone 6)<br />durable enough (travel with it, bend it,)<br />charges my ipad air 2 at 2.4 amps (unlike my defective apple cable)<br />28/3= $9 per cable: great deal (apple's are $20)<br /><br />cons: lightning end is a little bigger than the apple cable so i dont think it will fit in every waterproof case (the cheaper ones) but it will fit in the expensive iphone 5 lifeproof cases and im pretty sure otterbox too<br /><br />i did get this product for free because there were no reviews on it at the time, and they needed reviews on a new product, however they did NOT ask for a positive review, i felt it deserved it so my review is not biased"
great
"This is a great product and works well on a variety of printers, which I needed. It also does great with a wireless mouse."
very nice
"very nice hub, especially liked are the powered ports"
"This is a great quality product.  There is not a lot of protection on the front side of the phone case, it has a low smooth front profile, but the wallet portion is great and holds a great deal very securely.  Despite the low profile, it is a great design.  We will definitely be purchasing another one."
EXCELENTE
"Cracked plastic on lightning connector after less than a month, very poor quality."
"Great quality, looks just like the picture. Fits my phone just right. I have seen this quality case for three times the price. I highly recommend it."
"There is nothing to doubt amazon's shipment but the product can be better. The quality of the band is good but I cannot remove the link to fit my wrist. The original size of the band is too large for me  and I spent half an hour try to remove the link and I failed, I almost hurt myself, so don't buy this band unless your wrist is large or your wanna enjoy the process to fight with the link."
"This is a neat little thing, but it looks like the Android app is a joke. All of the features boasted about on the Misfit site are not available.<br /><br />There is no smart alarm available on the Android app.<br /><br />It's 2015. Android is the DOMINANT mobile operating system in the world. Apple is a distant second. It's long past time that it's ok or even tolerable to have an Android app that is not always as fully featured as the Android app.<br /><br />Overall this is a cool device. I wanted a sleep tracker and smart alarm. I didn't care about much else. It seems to work. I'd keep it if the smart alarm worked. Sadly, it doesn't."
This is like a new phone<br />Perfect
Good product for a fraction of the price! Works great! Covers the expensive watch nicely.
I love this phone  it came in excellent condition as I expected.
I'm having so many issues wit this phone... Either the calls drop or I get no service 😔😔😔
Adheres very  well even in my big truck
I love it. Air in a a car smells smells better and feels cooler. USB ports are very handy.
"It's just a clip - but adds a Fish-Eye, Wide Angle, and a Macro lens for your creative needs. The clip has a long reach in case your camera lens is offset from the edge of your device. Each has an easy-to-remove lens cap and an icon to indicate the lens type. My favorite is the Fish-Eye lens, but the Macro lens allows you to take some very creative close-ups.<br /><br />The only problem I found is my HTC phone has two camera lenses. Not using both gives me an error message, but I can still take a picture. Get these lenses and let your creativity run wild!"
"This little adapter works like a champ.  Our teen's laptop audio port got goofed up so we can't plug headphones into it any more and it turned out to be prohibitively expensive to repair.  We can plug headphones into this device, then send the laptop's audio to it via Bluetooth.  Works great."
Fits the Note 5 Perfectly!!!
Received very quickly.  Worked fine.
Never worked rt out the box
Great convenient wireless charger.
My one complaint is that it picks up winds noise pretty bad. The range and battery life is good. Audio quality is good. It's odd how doesn't go into your ear like an ear bud does.<br /><br />Over all I'd recommend it.
"VERY tight fit - I can barely slide the phone in. Also, the holes at the ends of the window opening don't line up with both the phone jack and the power button.  You have to slide the phone in upside down to be able to line up the phone jack. The circle &#34;home&#34; or &#34;wake-up&#34; button is pretty much covered up, so It's hard to hit that as well once the phone is in the case.  It was cheap, and I got my money's worth - NOT WORTH IT!!!"
"Great product, charges faster, lasts much longer than original battery."
"Finally a way to manage all of the cords for all the devices.  We have 2 kindles, 1 iPad, 1 iPhone, and 1 iPod plugged in and they are all charging!"
"I have struggled with several different screen protectors from various companies designed to fit cell phones, camera screens, tablets, KIndle readers, etc. This was, far and away, the EASIEST screen to install. It practically installed itself. NO BUBBLES! I have almost ALWAYS ended up with bubbles trapped under the protector, no matter how careful I was. Due to the construction of this screen protector, the bubbles were automatically forced aside during installation. I have also had problems with protectors that dull the sensitivity of the touchpad interface. If anything, this seems to enhance that sensitivity. It certainly does not block it.  It did not interfere with my Spigen Tough Armor Case at all.  I would eagerly purchase this again, and again, and again. In fact, I think I will buy one for my wife's phone right now....."
Lasted a month. Started to crack at a corner and went all the way through. Had to remove because I didn't want my phone to get damaged. Clear bumper starts to yellow too. My mother was not smart and paid retail. SIGH
wrong color arrived from China and you only get 1/2 case. Misinformation.... not worth it !
Once in a great while you come across a product that is so well thought out and so well designed as this one!  From the easy video to the versatile mounting options it is excellent!  We bought 2 and the same day ordered 3 more for our kids.  Great job!
Great case works like it should. Only con was that there was plastic I the way for the charger to fit. Fixed it with an exact o knife and works great
"These headphones are definitely five stars in my book! It’s really hard to find a pair of good headphones that are a decent price that lasts more than a week, and these do not disappoint. I used these for a day then ended up giving them to my boyfriend because his other pair broke. He used them both in his phone and his tablet and he said the sound was amazing. Whether it was watching videos or playing music the sound was clear and loud! He used them to call me later that day he used them at work and we had no issues while talking on the phone! I also love the fact that it came with extra ear pieces. Once you lose those your screwed and they give you enough just in case! This is a great product and I would definitely recommend for anyone using headphones on a daily basis. They are also very comfortable in your ears, which makes a huge difference when buying headphones!  I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review."
"I bought this product for my iphone 4 and it did not charge my phone, disappointed."
Thanks!
wont fit Y530q..eailer anwser is a
"Product came as shown, good value for the price."
Love the holligraphic lines. Feel like it could protect better since all edges arent protected but for the price it was well worth it! Used it a few wees now.
Like it very much!
"It works great.  After shopping around, this was not only a quality product, but priced better.  Excellent bargain for excellent product."
Great case fits the phone perfectly
"FINALLY, a Qi charger that charges my Nexus 6 in its case. No fuss, no placement hassles of looking for the sweet spot. Put the phone on the stand and you're in business. (This was the fourth Qi charger I tried.)"
NO problem so far. Works great
I wish this case was made better! Both layers are a hard plastic that does not work well with each other. Me and my husband got this same case for different phones in different colors and we both had the same problem. Our phones kept popping out the case. Whether it was a corner or one of the sides for some reason it wouldn't stay put. I honestly think its because the case is 2 hard plastics together vs. the alt silicone/gel base and hard plastic cover. We loved the idea of having the kick stand and the cool look but being functional is always top priority! I mean what's the use of added features to a car that doesn't drive??
"Great product and fast delivery. I will be be referring friends and family, as well as ordering again"
A great charging cable.  I'm order a couple more for a friend!
"The keyboard paired instantly, and operates properly. This unit is worth the price."
Great
"These are great Headphones! I wish I would have invested in the earlier. I workout with these every day and I have had no problems with them. I usually cannot keep earbuds in my ears for the life of me, but these stay in regardless of what I am doing. I keep my phone in a backpack in the corner of the gym and can move about everywhere and not lose signal. I have also used these on a plane and they do an excellent job of blocking out any noise. Sometimes I don't even realize the flight attendant is talking to me. I would definitely recommend buying these."
"I received my screen very quickly, even before it said it would be here! It was exactly what I needed and is working perfect!"
"This case has done it's job, as I have dropped my phone multiple times and no harm has been done. The only thing I don't care for is how dirty the part around the edge (mint green part) looks. I've tried cleaning it with cleaning products and it appears to be permanently stained."
"It work well for me , it was a bit hard to set up but after a few try I got the instructions could be better"
As advertised. Simple & inexpensive &#34;smart&#34; phone.
"We bought this for our cross-country trip with our 4-year-old this summer. It worked wonderfully! She figured out the controls relatively quickly (which I didn't expect) so she was able to pause it, etc. It won't continue play when the car is shut down (at least in our car it didn't) which gave me some peace of mind that it wouldn't accidentally be left on during a break and help drain the car battery. Out daughter wasn't able to change out discs herself though, because of the limited angle that the lid opens to allow the removal of discs. Older kids might be able to, and it wasn't really a problem for the passenger adult to reach behind and switch discs when needed.<br /><br />When we first received it, there was a rattling sound whenever the monitor was moved (like maybe a screw was loose and caught in the casing), which caused me some concern, but we haven't had any issues with it. It still works and we haven't had any problems with damage to discs. Like I said, this was a cross-country trip so it was used for probably 20+ hours in a matter of three weeks and there wasn't any problem with it shutting down or not working.<br /><br />The included strap for attaching it to a headrest didn't work really well for our car, but with an additional elastic band we were able to secure it well."
Fits well and looks great! Sometimes has issues plugging in to the headphone jack with aux cord. Maybe need a slightly larger opening so it stays connected better.
"This was purchased for my husband's phone. He's rough on his phone and I needed a case that will help protect it. He likes the look of this case and it is thinner than the case we had on his phone before. I think I am going to purchase this case for my son's phone as well. The kickstand on the back would be perfect for my son because he likes to watch videos on his phone and this kickstand holds the phone sideways and not straight up like his current case.<br /><br />The 4 stars may be a little premature, but I'm not sure how the phone will hold up when it is dropped on a hard surface like the sidewalk. The other case he had was both hard and rubber and I know that it protected the phones when dropped."
I love it! It's a must have if you never want to damage your phone. I've had one for all my phones. Would never not have one. Falls out of my car from my lap and it's nothing. It's perfect!
Broke after 2 weeks. The cord is still fine but the metallic top that goes around the male piece slides off. Bad glue
Well made product
Great case.
"There are pluses and minuses.  For the price, it's good.  I can hear music using this headset very well, from my phone.  It's comfortable to wear, and easy to operate. The downside is that people who call me complain that my voice is muffled.  I can hear them well, but they don't hear me well."
Great for securing your iPhone to a tripod for photos in any setting or terrain.
Does not work with the PIXI 7 unless you cut a little notch out for the power button. Also other than the first little bump the bumps to hold the tablet up are useless.
It is the best one i have had
easy install.<br />good fit.<br />still attached even after 4 months of use.
"I bought tone of these awhile back to help track a troubled family member's car (for actual safety reasons - no wife spying going on! ). Could not get the thing to work. Tried two SIM cards, followed the directions ( kind of hard to cipher ). Maybe one of these days someone will clue me in on how to get this thing working. I&#34;m a very technical person, btw."
Need one for my AssendMate 4
My sister in law loves this!
"Great price,  awesome product!"
Broke the first day. Cheap cheap cheap
Works great but after a few months it rotates around freely. Nothing a little bit of glue didn't fix.
"Cute case for a teenage girl, she loves it!"
Easy to install
Fits well.
Perfect
I just used the glass had a professional installation of the glass. Still have the rest of the set.
"5 stars ONLY because I want to be heard. DONT buy this case because it is not as shown in the picture. In this picture the florals color is hightened but when u received the package it's not. It's light and pale. Also, it isn't smooth like someone actually painted the thing and tiny frozen paint is stuck on it. It's a waste of money. Don't buy this!"
Perfect condition works great
Perfect n came fast in mail
Jawbone gave me this to replace my two UP24s that they replaced every 6 months as they kept breaking. UP2 just doesn't work or do the job it's supposed to do. It doesn't stay on the wrist. It is now lost. It also doesn't track steps or sleep all the time. Just when it chose too.
I would recommend this protector. I previously had another glass protector that did it's job and cracked when I dropped absorbing shock so my actual screen didn't crack. This one seems better than the first one I had.
Made a great gift.
&iexcl;Muchas gracias!
So i bought this thinking it was gonna be great! Well... It wasn't!! It lasted a week and the part that goes into the ipad broke!!
I like the style but the sound quality is a little tinny. Great deal for the price but if you want quality sound you will have to pay a lot more.
very nice
works great holds a charge for me all week
Holds ups to fall and throws from a toddler. But I do need to replace about every 2-3 month because the screen gets to where you can't see out of it.
"Just got the free samples before four days.AWSOME case ! Really works.I am very pleased with this waterproof case! I cut paper towels to fit exactly to each corner and I dunked it in a jug of water with a weight on top for 1/2 hour. When I took it out the paper towels were completely dry! It comes with a lanyard to wear around your neck or attach to beach bag or whatever.<br /><br />Good for the three layers lock seal,it is very safety.I found this case to be amazing made of high quality materials and it holds many items perfectly ,it fit my phone perfectly and I was able to add cash and my debit card to it<br />It went to the beach and the pool -- never underwater because that is just not part of my lifestyle. With lots of splashing and normal exposure to that environment, my phone stayed dry. For me, that is the ultimate test, and it passed! Sample provided and I am well pleased.Highly recommended!"
"Fits my galaxy alpha perfectly and is easy to apply, also came with alcohol pad and micro fiber cloth to clean screen before applying."
this case is lovely on my phone i lost the pen though but it still works for me i would buy again in a different color the bling shows up nicely as well
"i bought this charger for note 4, i am fully satisfied with this charger, its same like original one which one come with the phone, charge so fast like original one, and phone show that on screen its adaptive fast charger, nothing difference then original one. highly recommended."
This fell apart after about 2 month of use. It says lifetime warranty but I have not been able to return this item.
Excellent Thank You..
"Worked great for my camping trip. Charged this during the day, my phone during the night while i slept. Had enough juice to charge my s4 a good 3 or 4 times before it needed re-charged. worth the money."
"I bought this for my wife who is using it for her Apple Watch and iPhone 6 Plus. She loves it. It really is a great idea and takes up little room on her desk, yet works well for what it was designed to do. My wife uses her stand every day."
Prefect replacement.
Keeps breaking often. I had lot of high expectations. The first round worked awesome. I thought it really stands out. But however after some time the connections keeps breaking down. I am little disappointed. Will test it for few more days
"Great quality, no tangle, work great for phone calls. Love the color! I'd recommend for someone who wants a great pair at a great price."
"I've been looking for a backup battery for my Samsung Galaxy Ace Style S765C for a year. The others I looked at had mixed reviews - they fit for some people and not others, so I didn't purchase. I tried this one and haven't had any problems with it. I'm happy to let all searching Ace Style S765C owners know that this battery will fit your phone! I'm so happy to finally have a backup, it's one worry off my mind. Thank you AceSoft!"
Made it to me sooner than I expected and I'm pleased with it.
Installed easily.  Video was a nice touch.
"I got this and used it once and it did work fast. It sat around for a while and when I needed to recharge it it wouldn't charge. I thought it was the cable. I wrote them and they replied (English does not seem to be their first language) and said it probably needs to be replaced - to send it in on my nickel and if it needed replacement they would reimburse my shipping and send me a new one. I still think it's the cord. I'm not willing to chance that I'm right and they won't replace my shipping fee. It's not worth the trouble. I will look for a better one, and while I'm at it, one that weighs a little less. This thing is/was heavy."
Used these to replace some junk ones on some chargers I bought.  Tight reliable connection.  Highly recommend.
Amazing
"So, just a short and simple review.  I have a lot of items from my previous MacBook, as well as just general day to day items that I still use that require being plugged in; this adapter lets you plug those items into the MacBook. (A little piece of me hates you Apple).  I’ve been using this item for the last week, I’ve been using it A LOT, it’s now a staple for me.  I actually plugged in a USB hub with this item, so my no peripheral (one) USB problem has now been solved. I highly recommend and maintains faster USB transfer speeds of 3.0."
Great case just what I wanted.
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
Pleased with product
Awesome!!! Very pleased just came in great quality.
Everything ok
Is good.
Fits the phone and protects it well! My husband accidentally dropped it on cement and his phone was fine. The best cases available.
"not a perfect fit, but its a very nice fit"
Nothing like expected
"Phone arrived quickly, reasonably priced, works wonderfully!!!  It does not seem able to hook up with my Verizon back up assistant....  First world problems!  I will have to enter all my phone numbers by hand!  Sigh!  My original G'zOne lost the ability, but otherwise  still works fine for my daughter.  Might be a Verizon thing?  Please note, as rugged as these phones are, they are not Labrador Retriever proof!"
"This is my second one of this type.  I really like the window feature, although it does scratch easily, I will still purchase another.  Color is great too looks just as good in person."
This cord didn't work at all
It's too heavy for kayak use.  It weighs 10 pounds.
Thanks it is working great and charges fast and looks awesome
Phone will not update new BlackBerry software. Can't use. Very poor product. Useless to me. Will not update. Old software. Can not move my old phone information to this new phone.
"Cable didnt last even 2 months, it just stop charging my phone"
"It is very bad, i will not buy it again."
"This little connector worked perfectly for me as I replaced my 2003 Ford Explorer's factory radio for a brand new, up to date radio. This connector is critical in allowing you to preserve your vehicle's factory radio wiring harness. Highly recommended."
i like it
👍🏻
"This case fits the phone correctly, and I like the overall appearance. However, it arrived in the wrong color (I ordered blue), and the case broke the first time I dropped the phone. Th case now has a sharp edge that catches on everything, so I had to buy another case. Disappointed."
"If you're looking for rugged, dependable case for the Note 5, then this case is a perfect choice! I chose the case in the pink and black. It comes in two parts: the rubberized interior and a thick, plastic portion that snaps over to hold it in place. The case was easy to install and is a great fit for the phone. It also included a kickstand, which is handy if I'm watching movies or videos on my phone. This case feels like very solid protection.<br /><br />This product was provided at a discount by the seller in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Good case
I love my new phone case! I wanted the security of an Otterbox Defender but unfortunately they don't make many with nice designs on them (only different colors) so I was really happy to find this one from TrekCases. It's a genuine Otterbox case and they've added the design beautifully.. I'm pleased with my purchase and will buy from this seller again!
Came quick and was exactly as posted
Good product fast shipping
very good.
Way too bulky and heavy. Touchscreen doesn't respond as they claim it does.
"Haven't tested it's protection capacity. But I hope I don't need to find out. I imagine that to be a spectacular explosion.  it looks to be of good quality, and it was a fair price. So kudos."
Excellent results and product
Next time i do  better reviews on pruducts like this it pretty much died on me light are very dim cant even see after one day use<br />i was pretty stoked when showed on time for delevery plug it in first 2 hrs charging  bright then died dont waste your money i never buy again waist my money oh well lesson learn  if had - 5 stars that what i gave it i emaild the seller nothing in return yet least try another  cord this one mine did not work just beware if cheap there is reson why to good be true have good day happy shoping i still buy things of amzon one bad pruduct not going stop me have great day sorry for bad review but i had speak so u guys no if sell contact me i let every no
"FAKE!!! Comes in a Samsung official box, but IS NOT Samsung! Absolute knock-off fake. Do NOT buy!"
Love this mount.  It has worked perfectly!
"Looks nice, easy to put on and seems sturdy and protective."
"Wow what a great thing.  We've replaced the battery in our car three times over the last six months (the car is a 2010 model).  The dealership couldn't find the cause and said the only thing they could think of was that the smart key was always communicating with the car so we needed to move the key further from the car when we're not driving.  We couldn't find anywhere in the house that there was no communication, so, in desperation, I ordered the signal blocking bag.  Works like a champ!  No signal even if we're in the car.  Amazing."
"These headphones are great for light activity, but do not stay in your ears for long distance running."
I have always been and Otterbox user for many years. I tried this product when i found it on amazon. this product for me has been stronger than the otterbox. i have dropped this product on numerous occasions and even ran over it with a riding lawnmover. other than minor scratches it was in perfect working order.
"I've recently have built my own custom computer and I have a preferred keyboard that only connects via bluetooth and I didn't have an adapter installed within the software, and I've come across this little jewel. The procedure is simple really. If you have a Windows 7 or 8 you're going to need to download the driver before you can even utilize this device. If you have a Windows 10, the driver that comes along with it will bug out a bit, so you'd have to install the SB340 Driver from either their website or from the CD they've kindly included in the packaging. 1) Plug in SoundBot SB340 in your USB port. 2) Install the driver 3) utilize the GUI within your task bar 4) follow the instructions on pairing the device 5) you're done!  This little jewel is just simple. Effective. and Great! Not only does it just connect 1 device, but it also connects up to how many you want.  This is a great buy and I would recommend to anyone who is looking to buy a Bluetooth adapter."
"This product is okay and does it's job but my only concern is how hot it runs. I'm not sure it is supposed to be like that, but I cannot put it against the skin or pick it up while charging because it is so hot.<br /><br />Updated review: Four months after my purchase at the device completely does not connect now. Not sure what happened. It's never been dropped or thrown or anything. I take good care of my devices and now I wasted money."
So Convenient.
Never stayed in my ear and the volume control was always getting stuck on my shirt.
Fits super snug for my Galaxy Tab A 8.0.<br />I love this case. The price was amazing and shipped faster to me than it said.<br />Recommend this? YES INDEED!
"Good product, hard to open access panels to plug charger and earplug."
Ok!!!
"Perfect kit. It has everything you need to repair your iPhone. You have to put in the labor, but it is well worth it for the price and knowing the repair job is performed by you!"
"This is an exceptional power bank. I'm impressed, and I want to help other consider a few things if they're thinking about making a purchase.<br /><br />Charging/Function: 5/5<br />-This charges my various devices quickly and efficiently. I plugged in both my phone and my kindle fire at the same time, and they charged with no problem. It's also great that there are two charging ports.<br />-The power bank keeps its charge for a long time.<br />-This came with almost a full charge out of the box (score!)<br />-It does take quite awhile to recharge the unit when it's empty/dead, so you'll want to plan ahead.<br /><br />Design/Convenience: 5/5<br />-This is a beautiful and clean looking unit that came in high quality protective packaging<br />-It's about the same size as my Samsung Galaxy S5, which makes it very convenient to stack these two in my purse to charge my phone while I'm out and about (see photo).<br />-I was worried that this would get hot, because it's all enclosed in plastic. No need to fear! My phone actually gets hotter than the power bank while it's charging.<br /><br />Bonus:<br />-My power bank came with easy to read directions and a link to join the company's VIP program, where new products can be purchased at a discount. I'm not sure how long this promotion will last, but it's a great bonus for an already smart purchase.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in order to test it and share my honest opinion, so I've tried to use this item extensively and address some potential questions and concerns here. I will update this review if my assessment of this product changes after a more prolonged period of use."
"Great band, I recommend it. Looks like the real deal."
ive had these before i love them
Good item and good price
Perfect
Fits perfect should help keep the radio like new!
Crispy sound but had to make new holes for it cause the already did not fit
Worked to my expectations.
good case
I've used their screen protectors before but is is my first experience with the glass screen protector. It fits nicely and was so easy to install.  No bubbles of course!
Like this car mount a lot that I ordered a couple more for the family.
it's ok
Pretty sweet. The only thing is that I have a nokia Lumia 635. It doesn't work with my phone. If someone else found out please tell me thank you!
they work as advertised..
"It fits nice, but the case does not stay together I don't even use it anymore."
"It is beautiful, elegant, light, i can open screens at once, the photos are beautiful"
Easy to install but time consuming. Works much better then other products. Be patient when installing.  Editing: the screen protector only lasted a few days before the corners started rolling up and coming off.
"It rocks! Honestly if you need to keep your cellphone running all day because you work all day and you use your smartphone so much, dont think twice about it. Get Anker! It holds a lot of power and the price is more than fair ! Charges phone super fast !"
"Let me start off my stating my credentials:<br /><br />I.T. UNIX Administrator<br />Electrical Engineer<br />Music/Sound aficionado<br /><br />This is a 2000w rated Subwoofer with absolutely no RMS ratings, even from the manufacturer. I am pushing 350-400w *TRUE* RMS from a Kicker CX400.1 amplifier.<br /><br />Within 3 Hours at low levels during the break-in period, poof, giant cloud of smoke from the back of my SUV. With my amperage and current monitors I calculate roughly 122w RMS being sent to the speaker.<br /><br />Now, I was able to resolve this issue by removing the epoxy cover over the wire connecting the terminals across the speaker spider, and replacing them with movable copper coil wiring. Due to a MAJOR design flaw, the wires between the terminals and the voice coils are surrounded in heat shrink, giving it the single greatest point of failure that ever speaker manufacturer recognized in the 80's. However, after fixing these flaws the subwoofer has been performing optimally for 12 Hours now without another failure. I should have to fix ann obviously defective speaker just to have one work, but this leads me to my next gripe.<br /><br />Amazon Customer Service: You Suck<br /><br />I've made every effort to be fair in attempting an RMA and then canceling it, so as to prevent you from eating return shipping and refund costs, yet now I am being forward to your Claims Department for an overall review? Seriously? I have been providing Customer Service for over 10 Years and never have I gotten away with such poor treatment to any individual, be it a customer or a random person on the street.<br /><br />This will be my last purchase from Amazon, and while I recognize I am only a single individual, I sincerely hope this starts a trend amongst all Amazon Customers who recognize that being treated like garbage does not fly with your paying Customers.<br /><br />Thanks for the headache, hassle, and a fantastic experience."
Perfect.
"love it, so cute"
"This charger is a joke. It only holds the phone charge where it is but does not charge the phone up on either my phone or my wife's phone. Tried multiple outlets in 2 cars without better results. Tried the other charger i own and it charges my phone just fine. If I wanted a phone battery holder this would be great,  but no one actually wants that."
"Works perfect, haven't had any problems and it's been over a month since installed"
Exactly as described.;  totally satisfied.
"Product summary on web says it fits 5C, but actual package and instructions on delivery say it is only for 5 and 5S. Amazon summary is incorrect and should be revised. 5C definitely does not fit."
"The PowerJive blocks are as advertised. As in cables, you cannot have enough of these around the house or office. The blocks are sturdy and USB plugs fit firmly. There is no wiggle. These have the appearance as the stock blocks that come with an iPhone.<br /><br />I tested the output of these PowerJive blocks and the results were good. They met the 5v 1A claim. See my pics below for the result of the test."
Jesus Christ
"Came scratched, doesn't stay on, not metal, hate it!"
"Works great, arrived quick."
"I love this handy phone. I plug it into my sell phone in my office when I'm working. I heard you can get radiation from cell phones being close to you head. So I use this one to stop that. Plus it works great for using it on your computer for talking on the phone through the internet instead of through the computer {it's mac and pc compatible and works on any cell phone. Hope this helps you make a choice. And YES there is no volume control on it, I guess because most cell phones have volume controls and computers do also maybe thats why. You can adjust it through them."
Works great as a mini tripod to take photos with and also for a hand held selfi smartphone supporter. It's easy to mount your smartphone to the tripod and once mounted your phone is held in place no matter how much you move the tripod.
Does not fit Samsung s5
Very nice. My kids love it!
Great product great price fast delivery
"Item as described , fast delivery"
Not original...it's a copy
very superior Case 5 Stars
Great product. Delivered as stated  looks new.  I'm a heavy user and phone last all day and night with power to spare. I purchased<br />Purchased one for my wife and she gets 2 days out of a full charge
The wall adapter part of the charger works fine.  The wire however broke within a few days. I had to pull part of the cable out of the phone.
"My wife somehow managed to break the USB port on her Samsung Galaxy S5, so we ordered this replacement, which costs dramatically less than taking her phone to a repair shop.  Our original shipment was lost but the vendor quickly sent another one, once notified.<br /><br />Installation involves removing the phone's back, using a tiny Philips head screwdriver to remove the single screw and plastic piece that retains the USB port cover, replacing the broken port with the new one, reinstalling the plastic retainer, retightening the Philips screw and replacing the phone's back.  With the proper tool in hand the entire replacement job takes only two or three minutes."
Very happy with this product.
Great case at a great price.
Great Stylus Easily attaches to my IPAD.
"Perfect fit! After ordering the generic model only to find the camera hole in the wrong location,I ordered this one for my LTE tablet,and it's perfect. Nice quality, and the bonus pen is great too."
really bad sound quality.
"This case is really cute and fits the 6+ perfectly. It's great to have something so cute to hold it and my cards and cash all in one! Girl pockets are hardly ever big enough for a tube of chapstick much less a ginormous phone like these are so it's very useful. It is simple and pretty and the stain resistant material will help it stay looking nice. Mine is cream colored with a nice brown magnetized close flap.There is a small gold bird emblem on the lower right hand corner and the words &#34;Always Together&#34; are written on the close flap. This wallet case has  four slots for your credit cards and a larger pocket for cash and then the holder for the phone. This holder is soft gummy material and is easy to take The phone in and out of. I actually broke my last wallet case taking my phone out. First it had peeled the holder away from the case and then one edge snapped completely off. Since this one is soft it holds it securely but isn't hard to take in and out. You can take pictures through the case as there is a cutout for the camera. There are also cutouts below the phone for the mic and ports so you can charge or talk while in the case. The front easily bends back for comfort while you're talking on the phone.I am very pleased with this case, it is stitched well and should stay looking nice for a long time. It's definitely worth the asking price, if not more, for this quality.<br />I actually received my wallet case free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my personal experience and honest opinions of this case."
It doesn't exactly fit the phon . Its to big it just falls off.
"I love this little cable! It's the perfect length, doesn't get tangled and unlike my previous ones, the wires haven't pulled out or frayed from the ends. I will definitely be buying a few more."
"This is a great thing to have around!  I keep this cable in my car.  I can charge my iPhone, my husband's Galaxy, our kids' iPads, our hot spot, friend's phones, etc.  with one cable.  When I use some cables, I get a message on my iPhone that the accessory cannot be supported.  That has not happened with this cable.<br /><br />I was able to purchase this product at a discounted rate, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Great band. Only thing is you need to make sure it is securely snapped.
I am still using this product!  My only complaint is that after months and months of use and being bitten on by my son; the rubber has started to bend easier and lift away from the hard shell.  It still works great!  The softer portion just becomes easier to pull on after a while.
Clip broke to easily
Very nice.
"Excellent, no issues"
Great case! We love spigen brand products! Top quality for a low price! Can't beat it!
"Fantastic value, great for using your phone as a GPS or watching movies on your lunch break.  The suction cup has had to be restuck once in the four months that I have owned it, and that was during the hot hot heat of the summer."
Great quality
Great radio sound good.
"Seems like a good sturdy case. Tested it for waterproofing and looks good. The problem is that the screen cover is plastic with a dotted grid pattern on it (I assume for transmitting touch).  The plastic doesn't fit tightly, so there are bubbles (more like high and low areas) and not every place you touch is recognized. For me, it's the space bar area, so that's supper annoying. I have to press super hard for it to recognize. The dots are not too noticeable when inside, but if you're in direct sunlight, the grid is overlaid on everything and the plastic has a dulling effect on the screen, so everything looks dingy and terrible. Inside, the screen causes a rainbow effect like you'd see in an oily puddle on a street after a rain. I want to protect my phone, but at what cost? In this case a severe reduction of screen resolution and of texting ability."
"This is a great charger.  It has two ports which will simultaneously charge two Samsung Galaxy 5's.  It has two more ports that are for lower powered units, but I've had mixed results with those (they won't charge the Galaxy, or an older Samsung Rugby, but have charged other USB devices).  I've used the high power ports to charge an IPad 4 as well, no trouble.  It comes with a decent power cord (4-6').  I bought two and use one in my travel kit so that I don't have to swipe the one from home every time I hit the road.  Quite happy with the purchase.  Well worth the money."
"Terrible design. These earbuds will not stay in my ears. Tried walking with them but they fell out every couple of steps I took. I looked like a psycho walking down the street holding them in my ears so I never used them on a walk again. They only work for me if I'm sitting perfectly still and remove all the oil from my skin as the rubber covers get extremely slippery if you have the slightest bit of oil on your skin. I gave two stars because the sound quality isn't terrible, but for me these headphones are useless."
Covers arrived promptly and fit fine.
Best tpu cases/brand.
I received two bags and both were defective.
Follow the simple easy instructions and your screen protector will be installed correctly.  I used 2 of the 3 sticky tabs to hold it in place.  The screen protector is not noticeable and it doesn't interfere with the touch screen.  I had NO bubbles to contend with.  It took about 2 minutes to put it on.  Highly recommend!  I also signed up for the awesome lifetime warranty.  I hope I don't need to use ti!
fit exactly.  Excep tthe magnet was not very strong.
Went on pretty well but I should have purchased the one with the replacement home button.
Very nice i iwll buy it again.
"I originally gave this product a great score, after using for almost a year, the small plug has come loose at the stress joint. It does now Not work. This was a great price for a long cord. However you must be more gentle than you really should to keep the very weak stress sleeve from breaking the wire within. I would have to recommend Not to buy this. Spend a bit extra and make sure the plug and stress collar are all one sturdy piece. If you need a long cord and are very, very gentle this may still be just what you need."
"The sound is great, and I don't get any complaints from the person on the other end. The earpiece that came with it didn't fit my ear well and I couldn't hear with it, so I used a yurbud piece to put over it instead. Now it's perfect for me! I like how easy it is to use, and the battery life seems to last for a while. Great headset!"
awesome quality night light for this price point...
Cords worked for a week then started displaying the message that they weren't compatible with the device.
I got this for a discount for an honest review.<br /><br />I like that it sticks to things that you can put a suction cup on. It so far has seemed slightly more reliable connection but it hasn't taken the water test like another speaker that I have. It seems pretty sturdy to kids for instance as mine like to walk around with it maybe throwing it a little around listening to things like &#34;teen Beach&#34; songs or &#34;Phineas and Ferb the Musical&#34;.
"I've ordered several of these over the past years, and they all worked great."
great
Work great but can't connect to my ipod nano 7th gen
Keeps my watch safe from bumps generally happy!
Fast delivery and totally satisfied with product
It's a soft case but I've dropped it twice and it certainly acts like a hard case!  Colors are great.  Had several comments.
Good
Excellent
Fits perfectly!
"This a restructure of Samsung Note 4 instead of a new model.<br /><br />The reason this phone got a 2-star instead of 1-star was that it had great QHD display and slightly better rear camera. However three great features were taken away from the previous model.<br /><br />1. No removable battery, which meant once your phone's battery died in two years or less, your phone became useless unless you find a technician to replace a new battery for extra $100 or more.<br /><br />2. No memory card upgrade, which meant you have to spend $100 more to upgrade from 32 GB to 64 GB. In contrast, in Note 4, you could upgrade to 64 GB for $15 with a mini memory card on Amazon.<br /><br />3. Shorter battery life, since the phone's new features used more battery than previous models.<br /><br />With these disadvantages, this phone is worth no more than $250 with no carrier contract."
"After using this cable for less than 10 months, the cable stopped charging my iPod, so I have to carry an extra cable to charge the iPod. What a bummer! The remaining three plugs are still working."
"**UPDATE: I've now purchased two more of these for family BDays who adore them as well (especially for the receiving calls bit). This really is an arguably great buy. I also have customer service on speed email; they answer every question...and lightning fast.**<br /><br />To be honest, I never understood what the big darn deal was with all those pill shaped Bluetooth speakers at Best Buy. Sure, they look cool. And have decent sound. They are also ridiculously expensive versus seemingly much more capable, larger AirPlay counterparts. (My [[ASIN:B00903HKIS Pioneer XW-SMA1-K A1 Wi-Fi Speaker featuring AirPlay, DLNATM, HTC Connect and Wireless Direct (Discontinued by Manufacturer)]] is a rock star.)<br /><br />So when Vtin offered me the opportunity to review their Waterproof bluetooth speaker, I was intrigued...but honestly expected a 3-star review, at best. I didn't pay for this. And was likely to pan it.<br /><br />I'm eating crow.<br /><br />This baby is powerful. The bass on it is superb, likewise the mid-high level clarity. Build quality is surprisingly quite good for a $40 speaker. This feels VERY solid, has nice seals (for a supposedly waterproof device), buttons are responsive and nicely rubberized. No, I'm not running water over this guy to confirm...but feel cautiously confident it could take it.<br /><br />Sync was seamless for an iPhone (it took seconds), also playback. Just be careful to hold down the volume buttons during playback, or risk skipping songs.<br /><br />I discovered a bit of finickiness, however, when attempting to sync with another device...in this instance, an iPad Air 2. Bluetooth must be turned off on the original to de-sync the speaker. Turning the speaker on/off likewise is needed, in most instances, to properly reset. Closing a device or app will NOT de-sync.<br /><br />Phone use is perhaps the most impressive part of this device. The Vtin Waterproof Speaker handles calls like an ace, seamlessly switching back/forth between music playback and phone call. Mic is crystal clear. The mute button likewise works as advertised.<br /><br />For self employed peeps (who use music/calls regularly), this speaker is the bomb. I used the [[ASIN:B00GOI1HJA Pwr+ Extra Long 6.5 Ft AC Adapter 2.1A Rapid Charger for Asus Transformer Tablet Book T100 T100TA T100TAM T100TAF; Transformer Pad MG10 MG103C TF103C TF103CX TF0310C B1 C1 H1 H2 B1 B11 A1 10.1 Inch]] charger to keep this guy power happy.<br /><br />Last, customer service is surprisingly outstanding. Lightning fast responses, also very kind and considerate people. I'm a believer in the company.<br /><br />If you're pondering a great gift...this is it. This is an incredible speaker for the price.

Was looking for bluetooth sport headphones...considered beats but didn't want to pay the price. Saw these and the reviews and I was sold. These were a steal a $18!! Ended up ordering some for my wife and a co-worker
I just love this iPhone case if I'm out and need to  fix my hair I con just look on the back and I'm done I Recommend you get this case thank you Amazon
"Holds two cards really well. Will hold three if they don't have the numbers pushed out on them (ie they are completely flat).<br />I was a little worried how long it would last, as I open it at least once everyday. But it has held up for 5 months so far!<br />For the price it is totally worth it!"
Good
The case did not come with the bow and the rhinestones come off very easily.
Have had this for roughly a month and still working great. Which is more than I can say for some others I have bought.
it's great
"I'm in love with the case, it fits perfectly & really makes the phone look nice keeping the best parts of the aesthetics & adding new elements like the silver rim around the back completing the silver writing. Great job by Spigen."
Came faster than the expected delivery date. I love it!!!
Fast delivery...just as described.
"I just received the black and gold case and I already LOVE IT!!!!!!! Looks really elegant with my iphone having a black face. It was very easy to put on, lightweight, and I also ordered a screen protector from Amazon to protect the top of my phone. This case feels so comfortable to handle and I love the idea of the cutouts not to interfere with the charger, etc. I've owned two LifeProof cases. They are extremely durable, nice and light to handle but ended up throwing them in the garbage. I had problems with the Life Proof case after owning it for around 6 months with volume being turned down, phone being on when I shut it off and draining my battery so many times. I cannot comment on how long the finish will last on this case but hope it holds up well. This case is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!"
Suppose to be better but still does not hold a charge very long.
It is a great motivator.  Works terrific.
"Just as described, light weight and did the job for my 11 year old to wear to summer camp."
"They didnt work, and poor packaging"
It's a great phone case! It protects your phone and has an amazing fit. Thank you for the fast shipping 😘😘
I have 5 of these and have loved them. One of mine that I bought on April 2 wont let me fully charged it. I hope this is a glitch/defect and all my others keep working. I wish I could return this one.
"Will not charge iPhone or iPad, junk, do not buy this."
Didn't work very well with my 2 10&#34; kicker subwoofers. Bass was not very clean and sounded muddy
"I have never had any lucky with these screen protectors, always bubbles, always aligned incorrectly, etc. I did not have much luck with this one either, but I chalk this up to user error. The great thing about these protectors is that it comes with THREE protectors. So if you mess up the first one, you still have 2 others to try and get it right. It also comes with a great full size microfiber cleaning cloth as well. So these are great bonus for the great price you are paying.<br /><br />It says bubble free, but when I tried to put this on the first time, I had a ton of bubbles. I have not yet tried the other two protectors yet, so I am hoping by the third try I will get it right. I also had a tiny hair that somehow found its way between the phone screen and the protector, so that drove me nuts, but again, this is all user error.<br /><br />I recommend watching the instructional video that they publish and to put apply the protector in an area that is dust and hair free, or as close as you can get to an environment like that."
My case arrived broken. The bottom clip was broke. Case unusable.
Works perfect in my iPhone playing music thru my Aux in 2010 ToyotaTacoma.
"This device performs well, however sometimes during a call the audio is not crystal clear, I am aware that this could be caused by factors external to the device like cell phone signal strength. The multifunction buttons are always a problem for me. I would prefer a button for each function"
Ordered this product to replace my current usb charger and the one I ordered stopped working. I attempted to try and return and I cant.
Price is low proving you get what pay for.  Works on some products such as my kindle does not work on my tablets
Quick shipping and awesome product.
very good protection. fit very tight. makes swiping from the sides a bit difficult and the power button becomes incredibly sensitive.
"A worst product, poor sound quality, the Bluetooth is not supported with many devices. I returned it."
Recharge slow.  Not enough power to charge my cell phone.
I purchased the Garmin Nuvi 56 to take on my next vacation flight to Florida so I thought that a case that was the exact size as the screen would be good.  Regretfully the Garmin nuvi I will not be taking it with me on any trip therefore the case is useless to me.  The problem with the case is that it does not provide space for the auto power cord therefore the value is iffy.
A little 'staticky' but okay for me. Very retro
Great case..  Although I was expecting the feel of a tape and not just a picture..  But I gave it to my coworker and she loves it
"Unit Detects as expected for the price, compass does not work correctly. city button continues to stick and can not set while mounted to window.<br />power supply quit working, I opened and found the ground wire had come off, after soldering back it worked. after trying unit , I will most likely not buy another whistler unit."
"Nifty little wallet phone case! Just what I needed. This is my 4th year in college and each year I have to transition from purses to a backpack. This results in a lot of shuffling of my stuff, especially my wallet. I've found myself without my wallet on campus way too many times. It is not the best feeling...especially when you're on an empty stomach and stuck there for hours! It's super cute and fits my phone snugly. I've jammed quite a bit of credit and debit cards plus my ids...and it still manages to close. Yay! I was also pleasantly surprised with a screen protector. It applies on very neatly and does not take away from the beautiful retina screen. Would definitely buy again."
Disappointed. Even the thinnest cover keeps this from working properly and taking off the cover every time defeats the purpose of saving time.
Excellent product and price.
"Works well. Be careful about over tightened the screw as it can open the deck out especially on aftermarket decks where the deck may not be in perfectly with the car dashboard. Ball joint is perfect to get the right angle. Magnetic snap on and off is very convenient and much better than other phone holders I tried. Lets me have the phone in portrait and landscape mode, the placement of the phone in the middle of the car is great as well. I will definitely recommend to anyone."
Excellent device. All OK
I am so disappointed buying this. Immediately saw a big bubble in the case right after I put it on. I used to have the exact same one from another supplier and it lasted me months until my phone got stolen so I know how long it's suppose to last.
Great Product
"Lightening cables in my house disappear quicker than the charge on my phone.  It seems like whenever I want to charge my iPhone, the charging cable is missing.  We have 3 iPhones in the house and we were down to 2 charging cables.  I purchased this Kinps 3ft lightening cable, MFI certified, so that I could have my own cable. I purchased black since the others are white and now I will know its mine.  The cable works just like it should.  Since it is MFI certified, I have had no problems syncing my phone to my computer.  The charging speed is great.  My phone seems to charge a bit quicker than it did.  The cable is 3ft long so I am able to use my phone while it charges.  I will be getting another one of these cables.  I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
The magnetic holder is super convenient and has great holding power.  The suction mount is stronger and more stable than similar products I've used.  Very happy and would recommend this to anyone.
Love them. Weight is good and the thinner tip makes a huge difference when working on smaller screen. The replacable tips are awesome. I have recommended them often to friends.
"Have had tech Armor covers for other phones and loved them.  This cover installed well, but when I put the case on it started to loosen at the bottom edges.  I've only had the cover for 2 weeks and yesterday the bottom shattered.  This was with normal use.  I had not dropped or bumped the phone.  The case is a slim Vena case, but must have caused pressure to the edges of the curvature, to cause the break.  No wonder tech Armor will not warrant this cover as they do the others.  I will buy a different brand that is not edge to edge.  The case will protect the edges anyhow, so probably don't need entire face covered anyhow."
Good!
"I am very pleased with the Case. Its a quality construction and fits is a perfect fit on the phone, down to all buttons and plug-ins. Swivel and snap-ins on the belt clip holder appear durable. A very rugged yet professional look in full black. Again I am very happy."
"It's perfect,best screen saver I ever purchased"
Work as advertised
its the right size and i love the color
I swear by this brand and case. Even got my sister hooked. Have purposely thrown my phone across the room and it's still in new condition.
Delivery was fast and product met my expectations
this was the worst purchase I have made with Amazon yet.  it worked for one charge and that was it.
"What can you say, it works like the case idea. I have a spare battery and this keeps it charged. I rarely use the cord that plugs into the phone for charging."
"This is a very good minimalist case. Be sure you are ready for minimalist, though, because it is very thin and light. It has a good fit, and you get a good grip with it. As long as you go in with the right expectations, this case is a winner. And the purple color is fun, too. I've owned several elago brand cases and have not been disappointed with any of them."
Works on any device.  Charges rapidly.
Great product. Fits like a glove. Remember it is for the ballistic version only.
Only 1 worked
"I love this case. Nice and feel solid. I can hold the phone much better because the case gives you more grip and doesn't feel slippery at all. I little hard to take off though, so make sure you have everything set before putting the case on. Otherwise, this is an absolutely excellent case."
Its so cute I love it
"I started using the Super Bass of my friend and I loved, I had to buy mine. It is heard with good power and has good range. Thank you"
Love it. Good quality
"The back is not that great, the glue has already started to detach. I have had the phone a few weeks! Also the battery dies constantly. As a matter of fact as of this moment .....the phone will not turn on at all...I have no idea why! I tried to take the back off and that too is a pain! I would not purchase this phone again! I actually would like my money back for this one!!!!!!"
"After 20 min of trying to get them to stay in my ear, I gave up and will be sending them back. The leaflet in the box with the &#34;instructions&#34; is of no help either, so I have absolutely no idea if I am even inserting them correctly."
Does not work with a phone case on for the iPhone 5s.  Lighting input is too short to successfully link the phone.
"This case cracked on the side of the camera after only a few weeks of use. My wife never removed it from her phone, and doesn't know how it happened. The only thing I can think is it happened from putting it in her pocket."
Very fast shipping and it was packaged well so the film was not bent. Can't wait to put it on my phone!
"Awesome look! Hang these around your neck as long as your phone is near you never have to pick your phone up,  just push the button on the earphones. Clarity is crystal clear!"
My second product from anker. Works real well. Had an issue with one of the ports but it turned out my cord needed to be replaced. Customer service was polite and quick to respond. No complaints here. Great product.
My sister-in-law found some of these at a flea market.  Since I am always losing my regular stylus my husband suggested that I also look for some that attach to the phone.  I was happy to find these on Amazon.  They arrived very quickly and work just fine like my larger stylus.  I love all the different bright colors and I really like that I can attach them to my phone.  I'll probably never be like the younger people who can just text with their thumbs.
"Great phone case and feels nice to hold, love it, worth it."
Great case
"After doing much research we have found this product to be the best product value and fast shipping was even better, thank you..Want to stand out buy one of these fun bunny phone covers. I love this cover so much..."
Great looks good and work good Thanks
Excellent sound. Great price.
It's great if you are a male with a big ear but otherwise if you are a woman &#34;beware&#34;<br />It hurts and ear is sore for awhile after taking it off.<br />I do like the way it informs you of incoming calls. It would be great if they made more sizes
Protector cracked in less than 2 days...wtf
At first I thought Boss wasn't going to be good. But its a great radio.
Love this little product! Great sound and buying more!
great one i like it
Absolutely what ivexpected.
Great product
Fits iPhone 6 well
"It came faster than expected and was a great product, but I realized it was for 2nd gen and I have 1st gen, and they were very understandingand helpful."
great
Fit my new phone perfectly! I've had it a couple of months now and it has performed exactly as described. I am 100% happy with my purchase.
"Great product, but had to find out the hard way that wifi calling only works on the T-Mobile phones."
Love it!!!
My daughter loves it!  She has it on her iPod 5.  Had it on for a few weeks now no peeling looks good.
Works great over my cracked screen
"A tad bulky (compared to other chargers) but carries much more power and works just as claimed.  NOTE: charged phones, Nooks, and lots of other devices just fine.  Would NOT charge an Asus tablet, but the Asus tablet is a pig."
"Works great, but don't use the holder in the car on dash, mine ruined the spot where I suck it"
Great
Really like it.  Shipping was fast too
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
"Magnet is super strong.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the strength of the magnet, it sometimes unclips from the vent when I go to pull my phone off.  Otherwise a very good product."
Love this. I must have broken a million apple chargers. I've had this for months now and it hasn't broken.I love the length. I need to buy another one for my car!
Great product!
I loved this case! Made the phone easier to hold and was just very pretty.
It could probably be because I do not understand how to use it and the instructions were in another language.  It did not light up as it said in the shorter English version so I don't know if it charged right and it failed to charge my phone one time and one time it only worked a short time. Could I have a tip on what I am doing wrong? Plugged it into our phone charger and waited days for a green light that  never appeared.
"This product amplifies my computer output to my free standing speakers, very good sound."
Appropriate for the task assigned and great price.<br />No issues with delivery or packaging
"Over the years I have owned many different blue tooth headsets.  This was, by far, the best I've ever owned.  When my H720 got lost, I was heartsick.  I tried 4 other brands, but none of them offered the comfort and overall performance of the H720.  I am back to buy another one, and wish I'd not wasted so much time and money on other brands.<br />I tried Plantronics, Jabra, and LG and my friends complained of &#34;background noise&#34; with all of them!  That NEVER happened with my H720.  So, I've finally wised up....a year or so and lots of wasted dollars later.  I recommend this headset to anyone!"
We purchased several of this cases for our business and have been completely happy with them. We had one glass screen protector break when I was installing it and they sent out a replacement free of charge.
I am very happy with it
not for iphones  it charges it but I need to still attach my I Phone charger  cord
"When you put these covers on, you can't charge the phone. :-("
Oh my God... this case is amazing!! It's so beautiful and Lana looks amazing and brilliant on it. Great quality and I definitely recommend buying this case!!!!
I love Anker product!  I found their support is superior and their products are great.  I bought this over 1 year ago - using every single day - still works great!!
Love this case!  Very durable and cute.  My phone doesn't look too big in this case.  I've dropped it a couple of times and it still looks great.  I highly recommend this case.<br /><br />I recieved this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
"This is a great product for those that have multiple USB items to charge.  I travel frequently and this charger save me from having to pack multiple transformers.  It allows me to charge everything (iPhone, Android phone, iPad and LG G watch) in the same area of my hotel room using only one outlet.  The smart power function is great too.  It will not overcharge the batteries and supplies the correct amount of power."
Very nice case
eye catching and cute
"This stand came in a sturdy white box, absolutely suitable for wrapping and gift giving. Upon removing from the box, I was pleasantly surprised that it felt so sturdy and well made. There is a slot in the back to run your iPhone charging cable through, as well as a spot to &#34;dock&#34; your apple watch. It looks bigger in the picture, and I was relieved that it was much smaller upon opening the package. There are rubber feet on the bottom, and I was happy to see that it doesn't move easily across my desk. The design is awesome, and I love it. I received this product in exchange for a fair and honest review."
excellent exactly what I wanted
Works as expected
"I give it 1 star for idea, but it is faulty"
This was a total let down. I bought this case for safety on a float trip and did the test that the product instructed to make sure it wasn't defective. Everything seemed fine until we went on the trip.  Half way through the trip I looked at the phone and two inches of water was inside the case. The phone won't turn on at all and the camera lense is all fogged up. I'm devestated. Now I have to go through the trouble of seeing if my carrier will cover the damage when this case is what is at fault.
"This radar detector does not work well in Sg. It does not detect any traffic junction cameras, cannot detect any radar guns, only sounded alert when it was very close to a stationery speed camera (20-30m). It was a pure waste of money and a great disappointment. Perhaps it works in some countries but not in Sg. i wish i could get my money back."
Never worked anywhere.
"slips off occasionally but otherwise no complaints, fits well, good quality, durable, keeps my phone safe. color as pictured."
excellent
love the case. It is perfect!
just what I needed.
"I like it..it works as it is designed, which is all one can ask for!"
can it push some 15 inch kickers?
bought 2 one for my dad and husband. Both are not the most tech savy but I think it is a great phone for an awesome price.
"Big fan, simple and effective. Both my wife and I are now using it, would recommend it for anyone who spends a lot of time in their car or lives in a state where holding a phone while driving is a no no.<br />Gripper arms are stringer than expected, a secure hold."
Worked perfect for when I was away.
"Wow. Best $15 I've ever spent. 6 hours of non stop calls and music. Bass level is awesome. Almost spent 80 on the LG set and glad I didn't. Only had them for two days but even if they stop working, which I doubt, i could buy 3 more pair and still be cheaper that the LG HV-800.<br /><br />To be fair I've compared these side by side with LG and only difference is call quality is slightly more clear with LG."
"Great products, great service ! As always, these guys make premium products at a good price !"
Wife loves this earpiece and it was easy to pair with her iphone
This charger did not work for my Tom Tom Via1535 as stated on the website. When I asked to return the item I was told that I had to pay the shipping even though the product was misrepresented. Don't waste your money.
Great phone for the price
"Great product, worth the small amount it cost."
"My mom made me purchase this for my hike on the Appalachian Trail. It worked great the first two weeks until I changed the batteries. After that, it quit sending the automatic updates to the website. It would turn off until manually turned back on. Needless to say my family and friends thought I was dead quite a few times.<br /><br />I'm sure it's all my fault and I bought the wrong batteries or something but was still a big pain in the butt. I haven't messed with it since returning."
Love my gadgets. Thanx
The plastic part of the case didn't fit with the silicone on the phone! Biggest waste ever!
WARNING....Does NOT fit a 5S... too small. Nice case but cannot use it and dumped it.
Excellent
Its not working properly. can't even charge 100% of my iphone6. n the small round switch is broken. so this is useless. i cant even use it anymore.
"This mount is great! Not too bulky, works amazing on cars with shorter front windows, bigger phones work perfect on this, iPhone 6Plus and Galaxy S6! Doesn't work on my dashboard but having it on the window is no problem! I stick it on my bathroom mirror to hold my phone and listen to my music when I shower, its great, now My phone doesn't get wet. I like how the swivel feels so secure, doesn't wiggle around while driving. Love how the clamp works! some crack easily but this one seems so tough."
"Looks good, and I appreciate the ability to charge two tablets at the same time. My previous charger was also an iClever, a previous generation lower power one, and it's still running fine.<br />No complaints. Definitely recommended"
loose case on iphone 5c . not snug. not going to risk it. will be returning
I love my new case.  It protects my phone and looks great.  Highly recommend Otterbox!!
It's really nice having 2 ports to plug into - and it works great with my Samsung Note 4 phone.
Works great! I love the smart output feature. I bought the case with it and it's just what I was looking for. Great price and quality.
Good product
Convenient and protective.
It was for my daughter she loves it
Works very well
It is charging my Samsung NOTE 2 and S4 without a problem... works just fine. From 20% to 100% in about 2hrs.<br />I am happy.
Does what I expected it to.  Absolutely essential on a Fitbit Charge.
"Just got my new case and so far so good. Looks just like it does in the picture. Only thing I don't like about it is that when you open the case all the way the magnetic part won't hold the case when it's open, but I knew that would be an issue when I purchased it. Very nice quality and very fast shipment :)"
"Nice cellphone. The display is easy for your eyes, since it has an automatic brightness control. The camera feature in great. work excellent for Movistar. Very satisfied."
Great itrm
Works good. No problems.
"Cover was easy to put on and it seems to fit tight  All holes line up accordingly so there are zero problems with my Note 4.  I will use this cover as my everyday cover now that I put it on, I also bought 2 other fancier covers but like this one so much I haven't even tried them yet."
It works.
Looks and is as shown
Alright
"It holds up my phone very well! My only concern with it is you have to keep adjusting the center, but other than that, it works perfectly! Definitely buy it!"
It works as advertising.
I really liked this phone case until the lining for the cardholder started to fall apart
"Works well, but key hole is small"
I have had these cables for about a month with normal usage and one works while the other barely connects. 2 stars for one still working. Cannot return since it was a third party seller.
"The charger came on time, but I had ordered the wrong one. I needed the mini and went to the Verizon store to make sure I got the right one this time."
Fit perfectly on my phone.
goob seller A+
This was on my 2014 Christmas list and Santa didn't come :^( but it was in the high 100's at the time. Around $50 this is an absolute steal.<br /><br />I bought this to use on my boat as the radio was in it's last stages. Using the Deck unit with connection to my cellphone was phenominal to say the least. We put the unit on the dash or wherever. The sound was very good and loud enough to hear behind the boat up to 20 feet with intesity and clarity. Everyone was impressed that you could get this much quality sound out of such a small unit. I ran my DECK all afternoon from 12pm - 6pm continuously with no issues.<br /><br />Being able to now drive our listening from songs loaded to my Android phone or via streaming on Rhapsody was over-the-top. I can't say enough for how well this performs (at least in my application).
"So far so good ,like it"
"Nice and slim, haven't dropped it yet but the inside liner seems like it should protect it from 2-3' drops just fine.<br />I like the design and would recommend this case to anyone except and Eagles or Seahawks fan."
"This is a awesome deal!! I was able to use the car charger to plug in a mini speaker, my cell phone and a mp3 player, all at the same time! My car radio went out and i love my music, but I didn't want to run down my device batteries, so i plugged them in and it was great! Also, this is a KIT, it comes with a hands free set up too, all i had to do was stick the metal piece to my cell and attach the magnet to a car vent. It was that easy! So now, I can enjoy hands free cell calls, and listen to my favorite music or charge my devices, all at the same time! Love it!!"
item as described and arrived on time
Great quality! Got these for my 8 year old for her YouTube videos and there's lots of room to grow.
"Worked as needed, arrived with all parts as advertised.  Arrived on time.  No issues."
"Love it, best cover! I've had many spigen covers before and they do not disappoint!"
Great ham for starters settings can be a hassle but well worth the price!
Phones are too big now a days to not have some privacy. THIS Shield is amazing. You can also dim your phone more to add additional privacy but it's not necessary. I love that I can be on an airplane and not have to worry about the person next to me reading personal documents or looking at my screen. Great purchase at a great price!
Great deal! Brilliant application. A monkey could do it perfectly.
Using it for my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 on my work desk. It will hold the phone vertically without falling over.
Like
"its great case, Sucks to take on and off to replace the battery, but well worth it,"
"Tried two of these and both were a poor fit.  Must use extra force to push it in and again to pull it out.  The issue with this is that the phone's female receptor does not have a infinite tolerance for being forced and if forced repeatedly over time, can break off its mount and actually get pushed into the phone.  Happened to my last Galaxy phone which I had to replace prematurely.  Not taking that risk again here."
Excellent
It arrived on time as promised. I love the product! it holds my phone perfectly while it's charging and navigating for directions.
Fit great. Nice product.
"The iClever IC-QC01 18W Quick Charge was meant to become an extra for my purse, because I wanted to make sure I had one when I was on the go.<br />It arrived in a box with the user manual, warranty card (1 year), the iClever IC-QC01 18W Quick Charge 2.0 Wall Charger and a 3.3ft Micro USB Cable.<br />I plugged it right in and began testing it to charge two cell phones, and a tablet. It worked with all three with no issues.<br />It charge the phones in no time at all (less than an hour) and the tablet, which was DOA, took a little over an hour. Still far faster than the charging cords that came with the devices.<br />It is a lightweight model and fits in any standard outlet. It is a compact design which allows you to use the other outlet at the same time, so it doesn't cover it.<br />It is a great design, quality materials and I feel like it will last awhile.<br />The only thing I was slightly bothered by was the length of the charging cord. With it only being 3 feet, it doesn't allow for much wiggle room or usage of the device while charging unless you are sitting next to the outlet. (which I am not). I did try a different longer cord with it and had the same awesome results as above and was able to still use the devices while charging.<br />I received this to facilitate this review, however all opinions are 100% honest and my own!"
- The performance is kind of ok. Not the best though. Good for the price I guess.<br /> - Not 100% comfortable to wear. It keeps kind of slipping off of the ear. Probably there might be a special way to wear it on. I have not figured it out yet.<br /> - N
Surprisingly good case at a great value price.
I could not have bought the perfect car mount for my Mazdaspeed Miata. My car is compact and has a smaller windshield than regular sedans. I was forced to forgo my rear view mirror attachment because it limited my view of the road- that's how small it is. I took a chance with this mount because I liked a reviewer's video showing how simply you could place your phone on to the mount without having to pry open a clamp; I really appreciate the one handed aspect of it.<br /><br />You can tighten the swivel head to be looser or tighter and the suction cup base is both suction cup and sticky to the touch.
Really very nice piece of equipment.  Sets snug as a bug in a rug and is great fun when Periscoping.  No need to try to prop my iphone when using GPS either.  This is absolutely the greatest.
Awesome product. Even better customer service.  Bottom line... I broke the suction portion of the product.  They offered a replacement product even though it was my fault it broke.  They even did overnight delivery.  wow! Can't get any better support than that.
That's good.
"Update: Anker's stellar customer service contacted me and sent out another cable that has been working great for a week now! As a result, I've bumped up my review to 4 stars since I now have a working cable - but would've preferred to have a working cable to begin with (not a month later).<br /><br />I've been using it for only about a month or two, and the tip of the micro-usb side is already bent/broken, and doesn't work properly all the time anymore. Sometimes it's charging, other times it's not charging unless I fiddle with it.<br /><br />I'm very careful with my electronics, and have never done anything to cause excess strain on the cable - especially not bent or yanked the cable out in unnatural angles. I've bought many microusb cables, and some have frayed and whatnot - but I've never had one with such a cheap tip that bends off so easily."
Mine is going straight back.  Couldn't get it to turn on or take a charge fresh out of the box.  Don't waste your money.
"love it!!  Fits my LG G4 perfect, lightweight, glitter is really cute got many compliments. Keeps my phone safe."
great product! i get many complements on it
Great protective case. It scratches a bit easily but I didn't get it for the looks.
Stopped taking a charge after 8 months. Now it's just a paper weight. Waste of money. Don't buy.
Installed surprisingly easy opposed to other screen protectors I have used.  It is the first ArmorSuit screen protector I have used. I installed the screen protector over a cracked screen hoping it will extend the life of the phone a few months.
"Great price on this phone, lots to learn"
works as it is supposed to
excelente...
Great little selfie!
nice case will order again in future
Best screen protector I have ever bought.
Great product. Sturdy and shock resistant at the same time.
It looks like it's that it would!
Easy to use!
"Excellent product, wouldn't use my cell without it!"
I use this on my motorcycle and it works great. I had one that cost a lot more and didn't work as well. It's nice and stable and makes me feel better about putting my $500 phone on it going 70MPH!
"I installed the lens before realizing how small it was. It's an almost fit. But the cutout doesn't even fit around the button. I checked the label, and it says &#34;note 4&#34;, but then I noticed a different sticker on the front of the box that says &#34;S6&#34;. I think I have the wrong one, and from some of the other recent reviews, I suspect I'm not alone..."
i dropped my galaxy 5 times and there are only three cracks that appear on the screen! imagine if i didnt have this ballistic screen cover?! it is great. the reason i gave it 4 stars is due to the diffaculty of installation. You cannot take it off and readjust the cover it wont stick again. other than that its great if you hav invested in a phone.
Cheaply made.  Only good as a short term fill in product.
"Great phone! Ordered from Mobile Group USA. Was delivered  promptly, within estimated delivery date. Had for several months and the phone is working well. Rear camera takes decent pictures. Battery lasts typically for about 6-7 hours of usage. When on standby, battery lasts longer."
"Great screen protector, packaging a bit excessive."
Sorry for the late review. I just figured out how to use this phone. Thank u for the speedy delivery and the awesome phone case!
"Fits my sons Galaxy S5 perfectly, not too bulky and should provide excellent protection for his phone."
"i am very disappointed. the connector does not even fit into my phone, so i have to force it in. when i take it out of my phone i have to wiggle it and pull on it hard, possibly damaging my phone in the process. definitely not worth my money."
"I was looking for a pause button, this only had the volume which is also nice. But, with kids you use pause a lot."
I am extremely pleased with the product.  A dependable phone!
Actually really easy to install and protects the screen. Unfortunately it seemed to attract more dust during installation than others.
Good
Not good my phone fell off my hip with the clip and still my screen cracked.
😊
Works very well.
"Durable, looks good, visible scratches on clear plastic back (Don't care though.)"
Very happy with product
Best case that I have ever bought for a cell phone!!! it fits perfect!!
"Part 1:<br /><br />Previous batteries that were cheap OEM knock offs would get really hot when the GPS was in use and battery life would suffer. The reviews on Anker looked promising so I decided to try one for myself.<br /><br />I purchased the Samsung Galaxy S4 version and it arrived today. Compared to the OEM battery it's a tad bit thicker but the battery cover snaps on easily.<br /><br />It registered a 40% charge out of the box, which is perfect for storage. Enclosed documentation stating Anker has a very high interest in customer satisfaction was a nice touch. It included a toll free support number.<br /><br />The literature states 500 charge cycles, so it should be able to hold a full charge for at least a year. Many manufactures don't publish this information and if it does hold for the full 500, that would put it on par with actual OEM quality at a fraction of the price.<br /><br />No issues with heat or charge duration within the first day of use (it seems to be the same as OEM,) so I'll post back.<br /><br />Part 2:<br /><br />It's been three weeks and I noticed that it consistently holds a charge equivalent to the original Samsung battery. For me, that's about 14 hours of moderate usage with low signal strength. The battery doesn't get as hot as the cheap $5 replacements, which is really nice. It still heats up when the processor is working hard, but it's just warm and doesn't feel like it's going to explode at any moment.<br /><br />Edit 3:<br /><br />I noticed the battery was only holding 70% of its original charge so I contacted customer service. They promptly addressed my concerns and the battery was replaced under warranty. Very impressive customer service!"
Perfect
"I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br />I was pretty sick of fighting for wall space plugging those power to usb adapters in to the wall and having cables all over the floor.<br />This is an very practical and effective solution's. It does exactly what it claims to do. Feels solid, not cheaply made.<br />2 USB ports in the back and a long AC adapter makes it easy to tuck behind my counter.<br />Makes so much easier to keep things organized. This is a great solution to fighting my clutter problem.<br />No Cons. Everything i needed and Does what it says it will."
"This is a cute power bank from Sentey. I got this in pink hoping to keep it away from my husband as he has took some of the other ones I had. It worked!<br /><br />This little power pack is not the slimmest thing, but I am still able to fit it and my lg acesss into my back pocket, though I do have to remove them before sitting down, where I  could normally leave my phone in my pocket. I got this hoping for something to easily put in my diaper bag and change my phone on day trips. This is light weight and fits nicely in a bag without taking up too much room or adding tons of extra weight!<br /><br />I love that this power pack also has a built in flashlight! Never know when your going to need one. Also I can change two devices at once, as long as I have my own cords. This power bank does have an on and off button and lights that help you to know how much charge is left in it.<br /><br />Overall this is a decent power bank and is nice to easily take on day trips. It seems to charge my phone about 2-3 times before dying. Considering my battery is 2440mAh and I'm generally using my phone while it's charging, I would say it puts out about what it's supposed to. This isn't something I would recommend if you needed long term and a fast change, but it is nice for when needed on a day out!<br /><br />I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion."
Nice product at a nice price.
Durable and protective!!!
Wife loves it!
I am able to charge my phone with a full charge on the Anker. This is a handy piece to have around.
"Haven't use this case yet, but I have it in another color....and they are awesome!  Very well made and sturdy!"
Expect what you pay for.
"Worked exactly 6 months, then died."
Works great because I have the phone e in a case.  A magnate system wouldn't work  Very easy to use. .
I like the mesh tipped stylus.  They are much more sensitive than the rubber tipped ones.
Great
Good cell phone
Our nephew loved his little watch and it fit his tiny 3 year old wrist perfect. I liked that the watch band is made of a soft plastic that one can just wipe clean and its comfortable for him to wear.
Absolutely love it!!  It arrived in a timely manner and works as advertised
Not full coverage
The best thing ever!
we used it on two recent trips.  lasts forever on one charge. we charged 2 iPads and 2 iPhones 3x...
quickly charges the phone....
Love this holder! Looks nice and works great. Thanks!
"Really hard to extend the stick, I am rewriting my review and giving 5stars because u were willing to make sure as a customer I am satisfied. And u can issue a refund. Thanks"
"Its amazing, loves it."
Was not a fan of his extremely slow it was couldn't get any thing don't with it
Works great and gives me the info I need while fishing. I wanted a transducer up front where I was. My console sonar uses a transducer on the transom.
"Great case! It is sturdy, yet very lightweight and thin. This case also comes in blue and red. Just wish i-Blason would come out with more girly colors, like a hot pink or violet."
"Just what we needed, just as described."
worked good for a week and then intermittent for a day and then no output.  I opened the sealed charger section and could see where the capacitors spewed oil on the inner case.  Ended up just cutting the end off and attaching it to a 12 volt car adapter.  It charges that way so it must not have been any fault of the Xoom tablet.  Get yours from motorola and save yourself the aggravation.
"The battery flap doesn't stay down, it covers part of the front camera. I honestly want to get a different brand."
"I love my Aapporto Bag!  I use it for dog walking.  It holds everything I need.  ID, credit cards, Note 4 and a few other small items.  It even has room in the back compartment for a small note pad and pen. The quality and construction are good and best of all it fits a 4'10 shetland pony like me, cross body style!  Fortunately it's adjustable for taller folks.  The customer service is excellent too.  Robyn from Aapporto recently sent me an email detailing how to clean the bag of dog hair and lint both of which I have an abundance of.  I do agree with a previous customer who said he would like to see Aapporto make this in a brown waxed canvas style.  If they could do that and keep it in a reasonable price point, I'm sure they could give the Quill and Pad people a definite run for the money."
Works great with my Garmin 360. I set it on my work truck's dashboard. It doesn't move.
"Protectors look great when first applied. Ordered 2 for my wife and I. They lasted about a month before being cracked. No drops or anything, just everyday use seemed to crack it which I thought was strange. I contacted the company and they sent new ones out. Applied those and they lasted about the same time. Of the replacements they sent out: 1 cracked due to a single drop of the phone (my fault) and the other one is still alright. For $10, I would expect these to be more durable, but they are what the are. The company was extremely friendly and courteous which is why I give 4 stars, but the actual protectors are so-so."
The cap fitted perfect. The unique difference is that the original was wite and this one is black; it doesn't affect anything under the hood.
Works fine - great price!
Very good
"Talk about a &#34;Shining Star&#34;!  The photographs don't do it justice!  It is like a beautiful piece of jewelry that accessorizes my hand when I use my phone!  I love, love, love it! ~♡~"
Item arrived quickly and works just as it is supposed to.
"Very durable on the outside, inside vinyl works fine!  Great value for the price!"
I have a few of these and they are rugged and good quality cables.
This phone case keeps my phone safe from any scratches while inside my purse SUPER easy to use and super cute. The magnet holds nice and tight. AND it holds my ID and Debit card.<br /><br />I received this product mentioned above for free.<br />This is my honest opinion and I hope it helps in you decision weather or not to purchase the above item..
Colorful and works well.
As described. Fast shipping.
Verizon services sucks because I have had the service a week and already My 4 G is already gone on 1 device.
Its cool
Slipped out of my hand not even 3 inches and broke on the desk. Not durable at all.
"These speakers blew within 2 - 3 weeks after installation.  They sounded good before that, now they sound worse than my stock speakers."
Came just as described. Use it all the time.
It was what I expected
"Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend whose phone is constantly dying because he's on it so much. He has had it for about a week now and absolutely loves it. He no longer needs the lightning cable to charge his phone because the case also comes with a USB. He has also told me that he is able to get 3 full charges out of it without charging the cases when his phone is close to 10%. I would highly recommend this product, especially because he  is not technologically advanced in the least...and was able to figure out how to use the case in no time without the use of directions! :)"
"This is completely clear so you can see your phone through it. It does not block any of the ports and all the openings line up perfectly, which is a plus. This snaps on easily and isn't bulky. It basically fits your phone like a glove. I really like clear cases because I can customize them to however I like. It goes on quickly & seems to be moderately durable. I'm not willing to drop my expensive phone to test out the case to find out.<br /><br />I received this product for free or for a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion"
daughter loves it
I love it!!!!!
"The unit I received appeared to be refurbished, as there was no plastic film on the screen and the screen had some minor mars and scratches.  I could have lived with that; however the unit kept randomly turning itself off.  I checked all the connections, and they were tight.  So I am returning it for a replacement, which I hope will function properly."
Great value. Comfortable and never fall out of your ears while working out.<br />Buy these.
I love it well worth  the money absolutely  water proof and it's not bulky it's stylish and looks great on the phone and the sensitivity on the keyboard is excellent  well worth It I have the blue one and loved it no problems.
"This case is great! I purchased 4 & they all work properly. 3 were tested (4th one was a gift not sure how it's being used) & not one leak. You just gotta keep an eye out for drops of water that can fall in the case if you don't dry it completely before opening it. The whole having to put an iPhone 6 plus in upside down thing isn't even a big deal because you generally go to use your phone like that anyways. The lanyard on one did break but it's such a long lanyard that tying it off works just fine. Other wise, it's a great product & definitely worth your money. The pictures are clear as day & if I had gone underwater with it, the pictures would probably deliver as well (just got this so I wouldn't have to worry about water around my phone not necessarily as something to turn my phone into a go pro or something xP)."
What I expected
As advertised.
"Great case! I bought a large waterproof case years ago that has served me well over the years for water parks, etc. This case however is perfect because it is small and specifically for phone. I have a Note 4 and yes, it fits easily even with my Ringke Fusion case on. Its a small case so I don't know if it would fit with an Otterbox but mine fits."
"I just wasted my money I wish I kept bb the packaging. First is hard to use the edge of the phone I meant you have to press the edge part of the screen harder, still i decided to keep it but the worst part is it came off of my phone."
everything I ordered was awesome. grill mat wasn't as large as it looked
Works perfectly for its very limited purpose.
Great
Not pleased at all.
"Such a great product! It works so well and now my husband can charge his phone, I can chart my phone and we can charge the family iPad all at the same time on our car trips!"
"Great price - the case seems very secure, and the iphone is easy to use with it - don't have problems with the volume control, etc., that other people have commented on.  My one complaint is that there were no instructions, and I had a hard time getting the case OPEN so that I could insert my phone - there were no instructions on the website, so I googled it, and finally found a you-tube video that explained it.  Otherwise I'm happy!"
super helpful
"After some initial issues, they refunded my purchase price and then replaced the batteries with several more that worked great. Obviously great concern for customer satisfaction and a great value."
Received a shattered shatter proof screen...talk about irony
Terrific!
"This is a great little fitness tracker, especially for the price. My only complaint is that I bought a slim wristband and it had a tendency to unclasp and fall off my wrist. It wasn't that big of a deal until it fell off when I was out in the woods. Get in the car, look down and oops! No more fitness tracker. Wah, wah.<br /><br />Since my basic tracker was MIA, it was time for an upgrade. I looked at several trackers that offered some pretty fierce competition with Jawbone's newer bands, both in price and capabilities, and I stayed with the Jawbone simply because their customer service is really really good. If you have any problems with any of your bands, give them a call and they will make it better."
Nice screen for replacement. Nice packing and extra tools. Working great.
Thanks!
"I am always getting bored with my phone cases, so I'm always trying new ones. This one caught my eye right away with it's bright green color (my favorite) and black trim. The black trim actually provides a nice gripping material to hold my phone. It was nicely packaged and very easy to put on my phone. It seems very sturdy as well, which is always a plus. It isn't very thick, so it does not add a lot of weight/thickness to my phone. Its bright color let's me easily find it in my huge purse, too! :) I would definitely buy again.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review. All comments and opinions are my own."
Note 3 and it works great
Hi. I liked. The. Case. But when. I. Answer. My. Plonk. I  have. To. Hold. The. Case back why.
Bought a couple of these two or three years ago to replace original in-the-car video headsets. Work as well as OEM and much less expensive. Gradually grand kids have out numbered the headsets so we had to get more. Also work well with my TV sound wireless transmitter.
"Works really well. Love the length, can never go back to the short! I've tried so many non-Apple cords but this one is the best value for money!"
Case feels solid and fits the phone perfectly. Have not dropped the phone so I can not attest to the protection. The clear back is nice if you want to put a sticker between the case and phone
Alls well.  I just hated  the fact that my Samsung Galaxy SIII'S  media volume has and hasve been
Exactly what I wanted!
Terrible
Great case. easy to pop on but stays put. Love the red and black. Received it fast.
"I don't normally post reviews, but really like this item. Not only the  item, but the excellent service. When it first arrived the envelope was half torn open with missing parts and when I called they immediately sent me a label to send what I received back to them. The replacement they sent got here literally the next day, before I even had time to return the unused parts. I paired it with my tablet, and it works very well. The sound is good and seems to noise cancel as well.. I originally bought them for my Dad to listen to on his tablet and who has a hard time hearing. This is lightweight and will be perfect for him. I liked them so well, I am ordering another for myself."
Son wanted this to replace his broken phone. He is very satisfied.
Excellent.
Don't waste your money. Had this screen protector for less than 2 weeks and dropped my phone and iPhone screen cracked.
"When I'm running any distance over 3-4 miles, this band will chafe my arm if I'm not wearing sleeves. Makes for quite an uncomfortable run.<br /><br />Other than that, I've never had trouble getting the band to stay in place, etc. Keeps out as much moisture as you'd expect, and I haven't had much trouble using my touchscreen (Galaxy S5)"
This is an excellent case for my galaxy 2. Keeps it safe and looks very stylish.
"Very useful - clip your cell-phone in this and you won't have any difficulty finding it!  Easy to manipulate.  Grips my i5 securely, even in it's case.  Easy to carry, seems robust."
"It's a great case for the money!  To help other consumers, the color is more coral than pink and the case itself is a little slippery (for lack of a better explanation).  Never that less, I am very satisfied."
Seems to lasr very well.  Time will tell for certian.
"I love this phone!  Does everything, and more, that I wanted in a phone.  I had the LG 306G, which in of itself is a great simple phone, but this Alcatel OneTouch rivals any phone out there.  It's perfect!"
"Works GREAT!  I bought this so I could send music from my DVD collection to our fire pit/grill area which is outside the normal bluetooth range.<br /><br />This unit is EXACTLY what I needed and it works like a charm.  Now when we build a fire and are making s'mores, we can enjoy our large CD collection and not have to rip them to our phones.  We use it with the DKnight Magicbox II Bluetooth 4.0 Ultra Portable Wireless speaker and it is a wonderful combination."
Functional and cheap
S'good.
"Biaoge should be ashamed of themselves for offering such a worthless piece of junk. This item broke the second day of use! If they have any integrity, they will contact me to offer a full refund. Read the reviews and look elsewhere."
Great product.  Only way to protect your smartphones screen.  This item fit my LG G4 perfectly.
"I have a problem with a proximity sensor because there is no hole on  the protector it is transparent so whenever i make a call the screen is totally dimmed i cant open the pad or even hang up the call so i have to usa the headset, for the privacy it is good but it is anti finger printing"
Good product. No issues so far
The capacity is no where near 20000 more like 10000 at best.  Fully charge it will recharge a note 4 three times and that's it.  But it seems to be a solid built and a looker.
AWESOME!
nice and match the space gray colour of my sport watch.......the only is the sharp edge of the bracelet that causes some itchiness and mark on my skin......
"Great case, slim design and easy to pull out of your pocket but still provides a secure grip feel.  I had a screen protector on the front and back already.  I installed with the protectors still on there and it worked for a little while till the built in protector started sticking to the previously installed one.  I also noticed that some dust kept getting under the attached screen protector.  I removed the case and carefully cut the attached protecting film off the case and left the previously installed one.  Works perfect."
Great product for the money! I'd but it again
"When I ordered it, said nothing about not having an adapter. Now it magically says it"
Works well! Perfect for my phone
"I bought this because the price was right and it did not look too bulky.  However, the case keeps the power button down and the phone keeps restarting as a result.  Not even worth returning, so I am just out the money.  The materials are okay, and the clear plastic was neat, but obviously that is irrelevant given the power button pressure."
Perfect fit. Looks nice a sleek.
"This works great for phones both Apple and Android , but my observation ipad charge up time is significantly (25%) slower than directly plugging into Apple Ipad Charger."
We bought these to talk between vehicles during a recent out-of-state move.  They worked very well but we didn't get test the range beyond a mile or two.
this is a decent cable however it does not provide much more then .8 amps. For fast and efficient charging you need a cable that can provide up to 2 amps for iPads and at least 1 amp for iPhones. It's hard to tell which ones can achieve this power requirement but there are plenty out there. This will work but it will take a lot longer to change you Ipad and about 20% longer to fully charge you mr iPhone. Other devices using usb will also suffer.
"This little speaker works so well! I don't like the weird voice that talks once you turn it on, but that's super minor. Great sound from such a little speaker!"
"It's a nice case, was hoping it would be more protective on the top layer but it's not. I still like it though."
"Product did not come with instructions.  Huge air pocket on one side of the screen which appears to be getting bigger over time  Could be defect in phone or faulty installation (but without instructions, who knows)."
Item was great and will recommend
"I had quite a bit of trouble with this product.  I normally love Sony products, so I was hoping that phone functions well.  This phone froze quite en, extremely slow response time  to the point not usable compared to my other phone - iPhone.  I tried to factory reset or limited the number of apps to very minimal, still no good.  I finally gave up on it and decided to purchase older model of iPhone with the same price I paid to purchase this phone on Amazon. Very disappointed."
Great case
"this is the best way to go, if you use a lot of time online or what ever.  great cover for extended batteries."
"Quick receipt of product. Good quality. Fits snug as a bug, works very well."
well i got this for my 2006 Nissan Altima i installed a boss radio and well it didn't fit i had to cut the top off and even the sides are to big it would hit the lip of the radio so i have to mess with it some more.....so its not installed yet
As described
great product and smaller than expected so it worked great!
I will recommend my friend!This is a great gift!
"I really like the case and the duel layer. I wish there was slightly more rubber on the corners, but it fits very nicely and is relatively easy to take apart."
"Perfect! I bought this as a birthday present and she loved it! Fits perfect, looks good!"
Love it. Very easy to put together.
the side of it cracked within a couple days
Much more sturdy than I thought it would be! Fits perfectly!
"I was hopeful but dubious that this would perform as described.  I'd tried a few different headsets and all my calls said I sounded like I was in an echo chamber.  This headset is awesome.  It is small, light and comfortable and everyone I speak to says it is far better for on the other end.  The quality on my end is excellent also.  Syncing it with my phone was easy too.  I'm not a techno-whiz and I did it myself in about 5 minutes, after charging the headset as they say.<br /><br />I will give this more time, but will probably order a second one to keep in the car.  I love it."
Great charger and still works after a couple months unlike most non-Apple chargers. I will definitely buy again when the need arises.
The best
Very nice and fairly priced
Loved it
does it's job
"I have purchase a couple of competing products in the magnetic holder category.  Usually I have to be careful about the type of case on my phone and the way I position the phone on the vent-mount holder.  Not so with iSwivel.  It attaches securely to my big and heavy iPhone 6 Plus and has never varied its position, even on the gravel roads I travel daily.  Other holders have dropped my phone after a bump and rough spot.  No so the Swivel.  The the added bonus of the clamp for bulky cases is just so cool.  This is definitely the best system around for a larger phone.  Thanks Matrix!"
It falls apart after a little bit.
Everything about this works and looks great. The sound quality is ok but for the price what can you ask for. I left my phone in another room and the bluetooth still worked. Much better than I expected.
She loves it and its a great replacement for her old phone.
These speakers are HORRIBLE. They are also pictured with a plastic horn but that does not come with them.
Great bargain always need an extra battery for the phone charged up real fast
Great product with great customer service
"I really liked these at first.  I like to listen to audio books and be able to answer my phone.  I didn't get many complaints about volume issues with this pair.  I bought these for $18 and Cootree Jogger for $30, www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KQG6QFG, they have come down to $24.  With the Cootree I get lot's of volume complaints for the mic, whereas these had very few.  What I did notice was these had a shorter battery life by far, so I ended up using the other pair.  I would switch out when the battery went low but I noticed that that I was using the other pair 3 to 4 times as long.  They would last days and this pair would last 1/2 a day.  Still the mic was good so in the car was better with these.<br /><br />OK so because of the battery, which I don't think was bad as they would play music or books for hours, 6-8 hours, but just not close to the other, I ended up using them infrequently.  I noticed that one side's earpiece was separating at the seam about two weeks ago.  I took some electrical tape and taped it as I've read the reviews on the plastic going around the ear breaking.  I'll add my photos to the product page.  Well I wish I taped the other side too but I didn't notice any wear or separation so didn't.  The other side broke within two weeks.<br /><br />Since I had these only since April, that's a little less than 5 months, and I wasn't using them as my main pair.  Not worth the $18 as if they had been my main pair they would've broke in a month or two."
"It's perfect for charging on the go. Changing time is good too. As always, Anker my favorite electronic brand."
These are great.
d
Good
"Replaced my Soundpeats with these Tacoon.  Loved my Sounpeats, they looked identical, but that is wear the comparison stops.  The voice is not English, no idea when on, off, pairing, battery low, etc.  but mainly the sound quality is often poor, crackles, disconnects, lowers volume with no prompt."
Item started smoking after use for a couple of months.
"Cheap, works great, does what it says it will."
Doesn't fit the entire screen like it's suppose to.
"Not accurate cable,did not fit Nook as described."
"This case Sucks! !!! The hole for the sound is on the wrong side,  the sound button keeps turning the phone down, the power button turns the phone off and then after it restarts a few times the phone goes in safe mode cause the buttons are in the wrong spot. I had to cut mine with a razor to get it to work."
I bought this to use with my iPhone 6 plus in my brand new Honda Accord coupe v6. Well it worked. I like the way it holds  my phone. I will get another one for my wife's car. Very sturdy.
"Yeah, I know - it's just a cable, but Love, Love, Love! - where's the Love Button!? The Heavy Duty cable doesn't really crimp up or tangle so it's less likely to bend and break the wires inside - less likely for the cat to eat through it, too. Snug fit on connections on both ends. And with a six-foot cord, I don't accidentally yank it out of the wall when reaching to turn off the alarm in the morning. Without question - I'd buy another! Highly recommended :) If this review helps - gimme a 'Like' - I like to know if I'm getting through to you. Thanks!"
Awesome sound quality. Must purchase
Daughter loves it!!! Very cute and sturdy. Great protection for her phone.
"We just got my step-kids cell phones, and needed an extra charger so they could have one at each home. These were a third of the price of the chargers at the store, and work just as well as the OEM ones. Incredible value!"
Works great!
"Great case by Spigen, protects my iPhone 6+ perfectly.<br />I like how it looks, the buttons are easy to press, works with most lightning cables and headphones.<br />It's a but bulky though, but still looks good and feels nice. I liked the color combination, matches perfectly my space gray iPhone.<br />It can hold for 2 cards and cash perfectly, or even a 3rd card.<br />The only thing I don't like about this case is that the card slot slides VERY easy, so it slides sometimes when I take it out of my pocket or even while holding the phone, that's why I didn't gave 5 stars.<br /><br />Please remember to vote below my review if it was helpful or not helpful. If<br />you choose to vote my review unhelpful, please feel free to leave me a brief comment so I can improve my future reviews as they are important to fellow buyers like us.<br /><br />I received this product with a discount for my honest review."
This case holds up to all Maxboost says it does. I was very impressed. Far surpassed my expectations!
These arrived right on time. I feel that it was a good value for the price. Not sure how long they will last but with 5 more of them I'm not too worried.
Screen cracked within two weeks of purchase
I would have liked it to give the phone numbers calling the phone
I like the easier access when I'm charging my phone. BAD THING IS ONE OF THE 2 I ORDERED WORKS. Wish both did.
Excellent Thank You..
Comparable to Fitbit. Love it.
worrks very well !! no problems !!
"I bought it for my wife's iphone sometime last year. Looks really nice. But after couple of months it stopped working without any reason. My wife didn't even use it that often, she usually charges her phone at home.<br />It was wastage of money.<br />Will definitely NOT recommend."
Love the length.  I only wish they made these with replaceable tips.  I also have the shorter ones with replaceable tips and it's just plain smarter and &#34;greener&#34; to replace tips rather than throwing the pen away.
This case looks great and my galaxy 6s edge fits perfectly!!
fair does not fit the iphone 5 properly.
Shipping was slow but good product
"Sounded fine but not built very well, within 10 minutes the product wireing came loose and stopped working in one ear"
"The price was right, and the screen protectors installed with no more than the usual fuss and bother.  The Zune HD was in used condition so it wasn't quite perfect, but having the protector helps keep it from getting further scratches and hazing."
its my second moto phone last phone died in water.<br />its an awesome phone and worth money.<br />as soon i got the phone got my updates i wanted it for 4g LTE and it worked seamlessly.<br />i am not much game addict but game i play like injustice and angry birds were running as expected so its goood.<br />thanks moto
DOES NOT FIT XPERIA Z3 COMPACT. The phone is TOO THICK to fit into the slot. It looks like you can remove the slot and replace it with a wider one. BUT THE WIDER ONE IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR Z3 COMPACT. And heck if I can figure out how to change the slot adapters anyway! Comes with no directions!
"It's a waste of money, even for kids. Won't connect to the phone, specially an iphone."
So so
This product is exactly as described & what I expected. Arrived on time with no issues.<br />Thank you for your prompt attention.
love it
Buy a few. .they'll need to be changed every few months
"I ordered this back on August 6th and thought it was a fantastic product. I would have given it 5 stars at the time, but after using if for almost a month, my phone keeps falling out of it. There doesn’t seem to be any way to tighten the hinge and swivel that connect to your phone and so mine keeps drooping and popping out of the device. I think it is a great concept but poor execution.<br /><br />*Update* IPOW reached out to me and it seems I got an earlier version of the device. They have since made changes and modifications based on consumer reviews. They shipped me out the newer version and I must say it is a lot better at holding my phone up and not letting it slam around."
"It didn't fit my ear very well. Fell out frequently, disconnected itself, callers could not hear me very well. I had to order another brand. Sorry, I really wanted to like it."
"If you are accustomed to an Otter Box like enclosure, this case is very similar in feel / style. Thee 8500mAH battery cannot be beat! If you need the longest lasting battery and don't mind the admittedly larger case, this product is for you.<br /><br />My only dislike is the implementation of the belt clip. The case is excellent, feels good in your hand. I think the phone is easier to hold and use the virtual keyboard. I wish the belt clip was a little better. It's secure, but nearly impossible to insert/remove with one hand. Perhaps it will loosen up with time. That's a small complaint for a case/battery combination that will give you unmatched runtime between charges and excellent protection of the phone."
Love it!  Word of recommendation; I recommend the phone battery case with the wireless receiver already install; for this to work great; I have the Galaxy S4 and just order my husband for his iPhone 6.
Nice product at a nice price
"Excellent phone! I am using it as a tablet (no phone service) and it's much better than tablets, unless you need a larger tablet to double as a laptop. The size is perfect for my stocky hands, and at less than 5 ounces, it beats even a small tablet, like Fire HD 6, which weighs over 10 ounces. The screen size is the same as iPhone 6 Plus, and for a good reason. Anything bigger than this would be awkward to carry around. The sim card from my defunct tracfone (LG840G, which is not even an Android phone) works in my POSH. It just sees it as a new sim. Of course, if you want to have a cellphone service, you will have to purchase a sim from a service provider (AT&T, T-Mobile, Straight Talk, etc). The screen resolution (1280x720) is quite adequate for all practical purposes; it comes out to about 267 ppi. So far (after a couple of weeks of usage) I would highly recommend this phone, if you want an Android phone (or a small tablet). Note: if you intend to use it only as a tablet, then turn on the airplane mode, so it won't be constantly searching for a cell signal, as it will drain battery. Then turn the WiFi on (in this order)."
Great!
I Give you only 4 stars because is working only ps3
Nice case. Love the bright green color. Would buy again.
Good cord no problems out it it
"Works great with the HTC M8, iphone 6+, 5s, and ipad mini.  Plugs in smooth into the cigarette lighter adapter and stays in place."
Excellent case. Especially for the money!
Good stuff. Easy Bluetooth connect. Although it says to avoid using while charging weird.
"works great, a little hard to put on but once you get it on it works out great"
Work as expected. 3 Months of use so far and no complain.
"Love it,"
"Alright so i eceived this sample from Maxboost for my unbiased opinions. and here it goes.<br />When it first came in I was EXTREMELY skeptical. BUt let me say, the appearance is deceiving. Initially i thought, waterproof? No way in HELL am I ever going to use this in the water. NOPE! Then i tested it out like it told me to. Ended up going to the lake the SAME day. Of course dropped it in the sand, nothing happen which is awesome because usally taking your phone to the lake or beach or river you ALWAYS manage to take home a little bit of dirt. Anyways I even went swimming with it on my chest, still nothing happen! Of course i still got scared thinking omg omg omg my phone's totally going to be screwed, but NOPE! And i fell in love!! Sure i still got scared but it's soooooo impressive! It looks like it's made out of crappy material but man i even took it to my first music festival!! Highly recommended!!<br /><br />Protection wise if you drop your phone it probably will crack or something. It's VERY lightweight. So i'd just recommend using it for special occasions.<br /><br />One thing i didn't like was i was trying to take a video underwater and it wouldn't let me. So even if you want to take photos underwater you'll have to use the button on the side of your phone which is cool too. But i wish you could have taken videos as well. BUt you can't have it all!"
Very cute!
:)
works great
"Good stylus, arrived as expected.  Other tips provide a slightly quicker response, but this is pretty good."
do not get it unless is new.
"My 10 yr old loves this cell phone cover.  It is stylish, and I am pleased at how well it protects her phone."
"after three months, they are still working~"
Bought and retuned 3 of these. The pull out  thingie does not stay locked so it cannot be hung from a belt or purse. Considering what they charge for that &#34;convenience&#34; I say save your money. I thought it might be a fluke but happened on more than one case. (One of the cases was returned because the pattern did not look like the online picture. The other two had the problem mentioned above  )
I've had this phone case for a while. I'm constantly dropping my phone and it still has never cracked the screen or anything with this case on.
It's great--holds everything I need and protects my phone in a case that I can fit in my pocket.
Fit as expected
love it
They don't work for very long . One day for one of mine .
Works great and I love it!
When I went to take it off the phone it broke.
"Pro: Size is convenient. Looks cool but not very functional.<br />Cons: Would not stay in my ears, I should not have to struggle just to get it in my ears. It should be as simple as 1,2,3, Go. Not, put it in, possible use a mirror to help with the positioning, hook the ear piece thing and hope it doesn't fall out when you actually start moving. Buttons are tiny, hard to feel when you want to change the volume. Also feels like it is raping my ear canal every time I need to move it ! No thanks, I'll stick with my LG's."
I like this case.  It's slim and protects the HTC M8 fairly well.  Looks really good on the phone and feels good in hand.  The only negative is that the silicone piece fits really loose.  The could have made it a little tighter on the side but it's not an issue once you have it on.
Great clear case. Came in looking brand new. Ive ordered cases on Amazon​ before and they were used but I bought them brand new. This one delivers and I highly recommend.
Real easy to put on and great protection.
Not for Galaxy S5! The closest fitting case (for S4?) is slightly too small which keeps the lens permanently out of focus.
Works and good quality.
I like. Thanks
not a scratch was made and sometimes it feels cool as in cold not &#34;cool&#34; which gives me a really good feeling about the phone. Due to my rugged usage it has got a few scratches and after 4 months I took it off (Worst decision ever). Would gladly buy it again. Actually I will buy again.
"Wish I could give it zero stars, as the product fit too loose on my Galaxy S6 Edge and wouldn't charge. The second time I tried to connect it, it just plain didn't work anymore. I'm returning this asap."
I followed the directions on the product's website and didn't have a problem putting on the shield.  The problem is a few days/week later.  Bubbles started appearing and then the edges start to come loose and you can't get them to stick again.  I've tried two different shields with similar results.
Blink blink
Flimsy back...hard to get the case on my phone...gets dirty very quickly and unable to clean
This is my review of the Omaker Intelligent 6.6A / 33W Premium Aluminum 3 USB Car Charger With Smart Sharing IC for Each USB Port.<br />Finally! A cigarette lighter USB charger that will fully charge my iPhone 6 AND my MP3 player at the same time! I've wasted $$ trying the ones in the stores and they would charge my phone but NOT my MP3 player (Zune) which requires more power to charge it. Thank God I found this charger. I even have a spare USB port available to charge another device if needed. Do yourself a favor and buy this charger. You'll be very happy with it.
"Product received as described, shipped quickly, and has worked well so far."
OK.
This is a ripoff
great
worked as promissed
I Will come back
"Very Cheap and thin, wouldn't recommend"
I like this case a lot.  I had the Defender's case but it was too bulky.  This is much easier to carry around.  Thank you.
"Honestly, for the price I paid and how simple it is to use, I love it. I received this item very early, it gave me an estimate of September 9-28 and I got it August 29th. I have an LG G Stylo phone and the stand holds it up perfectly. I will purchase from this seller again."
Good case
"works fine, good price. no problems."
"Came quickly, good quality and husband likes a lot.  Thanks Cell-Nerds!"
"This product is a simple yet effective way to charge your devices when the power goes out.  It uses readily available AA batteries and outputs the power to a full size USB port for plugging in various devices.  Keep in mind the amperage output may not be great enough for some tablet devices.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Compact and sturdy<br />- 3 LED lights indicate the amount of power remaining and indicate whether it is charging<br />- With a pack of AA batteries you can power up additional devices (vs having to recharge like a Li-ion charger)<br /><br />Cons<br />- LED lights are very bright and you'll want to cover them up if charging at night (i.e. in a bedroom)<br />- Package with old 30 pin iphone cable (vs newer lightening cable)<br /><br />Overall, this is a great product to use for camping or a power failure."
Work as intended.<br />I love it feels great.<br />Thank you.
my son loves this.
"Great screen protector. It comes with everything you need for installation, which is pretty simple. Though, there were a few air bubbles that were somewhat difficult to remove, but we got most of them. And there  was no debris stuck underneath.  The screen protector fits well and lines up well, but it doesn't quite reach the edges. That's really the only thing I didn't like about the protector. There is too much unprotected space on the edges. Though my case does cover a good amount of that space.The best thing is the anti-shatter film and the coating really does prevent finger prints. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review."
Border case wore out within a couple of weeks
"Love the solid connection these make, stays solid in the phone. The issue I have had is that on the long cable the springs failed and now the cord doesn't stay in the phone well at all. The other 4 have not had that failure yet.<br />Owned for about 1 month prior to failure."
Functions as advertised.
"[[VIDEOID:81d6d464a3e989f9ed3070556f759119]] I got a free sample of this for review.<br /><br />I know it says \\""green\\"" and \\""red\\"" in the description, but the pictures are correct: they are indeed mint and pink. Which isn't a bad thing: it is a very nice pink colour, and it goes surprisingly well with the gold of the plastic bottom that slides out to make it easy to put the phone into the case.<br /><br />It comes in a nice, plastic retail case, which looks pleasant enough, and would still be nice if this were to be given away as a present to someone special.<br /><br />The cover also covers the buttons on the side, protecting them too, and the whole thing feels very comfortable in the hand, offering a good grip with its nice rubbery material.<br /><br />I didn't have an iPhone at hand when I made the video, but a later test confirms it is a nice, tight and secure fit, all buttons and sockets easily accessible and a much improved grip over the bare phone itself.<br /><br />It does build a little bit of thickness to the iPhone, but not excessively so. It adds little weight, almost making it feel lighter because of the increased size, but that added size is also padding that will potentially protect your expensive iDevice from a lot of knocks and falls.<br /><br />The rubbery material has a bit of bounce to it, which will help absorb shocks much better than many other back covers I've seen, also having a nice edge extending above screen height which might save it from a face-down fall to the ground<br />as well.<br /><br />In short: it's a nice cover that I can certainly recommend - if you like the styling and colour of it."
"Love this phone case. I originally bought it to protect my phone while I found a more &#34;permanent&#34; case. But I ended up loving it so much, I never got another case. Slim and fits perfectly."
Still having trouble snapping it together.
Piece of crap. So tight. Doesn't even Barely fit.
"i received this product in exchange for an unbiased review the shipping was fast and the package was secure and safe, no broken parts made of durable materials easy to install with clear instructions fits my Iphone 6+ perfectly doesn't interfere with the camera all ports and speakers work perfectly stylish. It is thin and lightweight but very good protector i have dropped my phone quite a few times and i also keep in a large purse, my phone is very safe and well protected"
Great item
"Worked for a while, then stopped"
"Good quality. Sturdy, but not bulky."
cool!
"excelent, very happy."
This Qi charger works great at a fraction of the cost of the OEM brand.  I've yet to be disappointed by Anker.
"The case is fine and the battery last as long as I need it. However, the audio jack extender broke within two weeks of purchase and since I listen to music often I am very upset."
"Love it love it love it!!!! One of the best cover. A bit shallow on the sides, but the jelly material hugs the phone enough to protect it. I highly recommend this one."
worked well
"Great tool to replace one lost in fire. Though reconditioned, like new. Thanks!! Delivered as promised."
It's tough and looks nice but it does not protect your screen if it were to fall face first. The case sits flush to the front of the phone which is the most important part. Nothing else seems worth it in comparison to the biggest flaw it has. Wish I could return it.
"Works as described.  I bought it to have earphones with some noise blocking capability for use on a tractor.  I have ear-bud phones which block noise and these block better with better sound and no more gooey-squishy-sweat in my ear canals.  I have paired it with 2 tablets (one android, one Windows) and my phone all easily.  Good sound quality. Does not block enough outside sound to serve as hearing protection, nor would I expect it to, but it is close and works well for my needs in a tractor which isn't very loud.<br /><br />Pros:  Good sound quality.  Voice notifications lets you know on/off/pairing.  Comfortable (fits fully over my ears).  Range; I tried pairing to my phone when outside ready to hit the tractor and it wouldn't do it....came to realize it was still connected inside to my tablet which I had to go inside to disconnect.  Nice compact case.<br />Cons:  At this price point I can't complain.  The USB charger cable is unique and may be difficult to replace (USB to mic jack). They feel &#34;flimsy&#34; but then that means they are lightweight and comfortable for work-use or long games.<br />Unknowns:  I haven't run the battery dead yet to know run time; at least a few hours.  Microphone; haven't tried it.<br /><br />Bottom line:  when these wear out I will get another pair.  I will probably buy two more for my kids for road trips as they have systematically destroyed the &#34;wire&#34; with each wired set that I have bought them."
"I think this phone case is great! I always love the idea of having a slot for a card or ID.  I use it when I go out at night and do not want to carry around a purse or some sort so I hold my ID in this.  Also, the case is very strong and cover the whole phone very well.  I dropped it numerous of time as well and I haven't had any scratches.  The case is very light as well and not too big making it easy to carry and bring around.<br /><br />I review his product at a discount price in exchange for an honest review."
It works!
"It's okay. I like the dreamcatcher graphic a lot. The case itself is very thin and the edging on her sides is not seamless. The edges have a small plastic &#34;tail&#34; that is left over from when the case was cut. It's not horrible but it is noticeable and annoying.<br /><br />Not sure what I expected though, afterall its $5."
Great!
Hands free....love it
This product is not for a Samsung note 3
The phone case was ok. The kick stand broke after about 2 weeks. And the the case did start to chip.
"I got this case w/keyboard in the map design and I just love it. The wireless keyboard connects quickly and, even though it's small, has enough room to type easily.  I like the fact that it will connect with my iPhone as well. Since the keyboard is magnetic it removes from the case allowing you to use it anywhere. The case closes well around the iPad mini whether the keyboard is inside or not."
"This is an awesome device for the price I paid! I previously purchased a more expensive one & it didn't work at all, yet this one really owns up to its description, it works! Not to mention that you can charge 2 gadgets at the same time, I love it!!!!"
"Works great, but only for a very short limit of time.<br />Maybe, 1 or 2 months, then you must to buy a new one."
"This case has given me a nice sense of security. Adds minimal girth the the thin designed iPhone. But still gives the rugged protection to people who genuinely are careful as it is, but need that little peace of mind. The material used gives me that little bit of grip my dry hands needed. The socket covers for the headphones and charge port are awesome. Firm with a little something to plug the holes. I have I tempered glass screen guard on the phone already, but no need to remove. Touch works perfectly."
Broke and plastic is cheap and scratches
Great Quality
"Worked great, we will be ordering more"
"I really like these, they sound great, are comfortable for long usage, and i get more than 5 hours of battery life."
Good
Worked for 3 days then broke. Very dissatisfied.
Fit phone great. Only complaint was the tab on the corner left a sticky residue that I am still working to remove.
Excellent case!!!  Very cute and functional!
Good case.  I like the design.  The kickstand squeaks.
I liked receiving a 3 pack because I'm not that good at putting on screen protectors but having the 2 layer on these helps greatly!  The final layer helps keep the screen protector stiff so that it's easier to apply as well as protects your screen protector from getting scratched when removing the air bubbles.<br /><br />I didn't do too bad and a trick I learned was to use the sticky side of scotch tape to remove any lint that may get on the sticky side of the screen protector.  This covered most of the screen like other ones I've used.  The phone case covers the rest.<br /><br />The antiglare feature is a must have these days!<br /><br />I receieved a discount on this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.  5 stars are never guaranteed but this product was exactly what I expected!
I love my case! It's very durable.
"Initial reaction is &#34;wow these sound good&#34;  Bluetooth connection worked just as described and no problem.  Only difference from &#34;Chinglish&#34; manual is where it says LED will turn green when connection is successful, mine blinks blue instead.  Only took approx 1/2 hour for initial charge with included USB connector.  Quality appears acceptable but time will tell in use with travel as I intend."
Good product. Immersize.<br /><br />-1 star because it hurts the bridge of your nose.
Real handy
Very impressed! High quality and super length! It shipped so fast it was unbelievable !
The highlight of this delivery was the fact that it arrived in one day.  I was disappointed to receive a blue cover when I asked for black and the back cover had the corner peeled back already.
"I can't live without music, and these ear phones have the bass every music lover desires... Another great feature about the device is that it speaks to you. Tells you when it's turned on-off, when it connects to a device and when it gets to the loudest volume. The buttons are easy to use, you can start-pause-skip songs with the buttons. Just play around with them and you'll figure it out. As it turned out, these ear buds have a combination of really clever design features which make them my current favorites. Sound quality, this is perfect too. This is very good, comparable to more expensive brands, and I love to be able to hear layering and detail in my sound, rather than just loud noises. There is good balance between treble and bass, which is also unusual, with most ear buds rendering bass poorly. In conclusion, I am very happy with this headset. It works well, pairs easily with all the devices I have tried it with, battery life is good, fit is excellent and stays comfortable for long periods of wearing it, sound is above average to great, price is competitive, and it is a tiny thing to carry around. Definitely worth buying!"
My boyfriend never uses a case for his phone but loves to use this one for obvious reasons. But deff a purchase to make if you want it for the same obvious reasons aha
Horible !  It broke down in 6 weeks
Perfect
Gives no longer use than the stock Samsung battery.
This is a great speaker! Bought it for the golf course and it works perfect. Good sound from this tiny speaker! I have already recommended it to several other people!
"Needs to be updated.  Get rid of the things in Chinese.  The QR code doesn't do anything.  I keep being told to refer to the app, which does nothing except for work with the pedometer.  Couldn't figure out for the life of me how to get text messages to show on the phone.  The font is so small and hard to read, and I've had Lasik surgery and was wearing reading glasses to try and see it.  The instructions are very hard to understand."
"Received the order, installed on watch and it would not close correctly unable to close one of the clips. Lost the cover, threw away"
"The back scratches really easily.  It scratched up on the first day I got it.  Also, it has a very small edge so when I dropped my phone for the very first time, it cracked my tempered glass screen protector.  I think it was because the tempered glass screen protector was actually sitting slightly higher than this case's edge.  If the edge on this case had been a little higher, the case would have protected it from hitting the screen on the ground. I purchased an otter box after this.  It's much better!"
"Delivery was fast, and devise works well, as described."
Love this case and I order 2 more. Nice design .Perfect fit. Very good price.
just as described.  The band works well.  I would order another if needed1
"THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT FROM A NEW COMPANY THAT HAS A BAD PRODUCT<br />after two weeks of the earpieces separated, exposing the wires. When i contacted the company i was told i had gotten a defective product, but they did'nt have any inventory for a few weeks; hoping i could wait.In addition, it took about 10 days to arrive when i first ordered it.The range of this headset is about 10 feet, whic is far less than my LG.<br />Per the company customer service, this is a brand new company located in Germany They clearly do not know what they are doing. I had an LG for 3 years with no problems...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. AVOID THIS PRODUCT"
It's absurd that Amazon is selling this item.  It speaks in Chinese and there's no information on how to change the language.
Use this during a week in the sierra's at a Summer Camp for a couple of adults who had to try and keep 11 boys organized. Worked great. The rechargeable battery last almost 4 days before having to charge or change to batteries. Like the option to use rechargeable or regular batteries.
"Very happy with the case!  It looks fantastic and is great quality --- especially for the price.  Received it earlier than expected which is always a bonus.  One minor downside ---- when using credit card slot, the case does not touch the phone screen thus the screen does not automatically go into sleep mode.  Still very happy with purchase and would buy again."
Exactly what i needed. Works in my 08 f250. Thanks!
"Very easy to install, very under priced"
Smooth and slim but still protects well. Great purchase for the cost.
Easy to use..practical and effective.
One of the three cables already stopped working and iPhone message says that the cable is not certified... Do not buy this brand  Updating 09/10/2015 - 2 of the three cables have failed. Don't waste your time or money on these. They are obviously NOT CERTIFIED or just CERTIFIED TO FAIL!!!!!!!
Obviously it is a cheap case but it looks more cheap in person than on these pictures. I ended up just throwing it away.
Charges my iPhone 6 Plus at least 3 times. A con is that it takes many hours for the actual power bank to charge.
"All you would expect from a top-of-the-line Android phone. I chose the Galaxy 5 over the 6 because I wanted to use my SD card, and I wanted to replace the battery when it gets low of charge. Metro pcs offers a real unlimited data/talk plan (no throttled speed) for $60/mo. I upgraded from the Galaxy S3, and my only complaint is the high price."
"Initially, I would have given this a great review as it went on very well and was indeed very clear.  HOWEVER, they said that the sections that had a wavy appearance would disappear after a few days.....they didn't.  I can live with that, BUT it was impossible to keep clean.  Every single touch leaves noticeable marks on the phone and needs cleaned constantly.  Even that could almost be tolerable for good protection, but now, about 2 weeks after I put it on, it just lifted off.  I would not recommend this product.  Very disappointed."
"Very prompt delivery, and item as described, but cannot charge it with some of the non-apple chargers. The opening at the bottom is not wide enough to insert the cable fully in. Very nice design."
Didn't work.
I love it
Great quality.
"Fit perfectly, stopped my phone from overheating when using with the wallet case."
"I'll admit, it looks very nice. It's also very thin, light and doesn't offer much protection. The bumper doesn't go all the way around the phone. The top and bottom edges are open and completely expose the phone. I returned this and purchased a case by Carved of equal price, but much better protection and it's made in the USA. It's made from quality wood and designed to keep the phone safe as well as look beautiful.<br /><br />Check out http://www.amazon.com/CARVED-Cedar-iPhone-Traveler-Case/dp/B00R55SEGA/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1440947528&sr=1-1&keywords=carved+iphone+6+case"
It was to hard to mess with the buttons. Didn't keep it on at all.
Just what I ordered  Held at 100 MPH
"this battery works well as the one I had, which is as much as I could have expected. I was just hoping it would last longer than the year old one I had been using. I'll have to spend aliitle more next time."
love
Built a cooler-stereo with this and it works very well.  It IS waterproof but I did use caulking around it for extra water protection.  Give a good stereo signal though and I would recommend it.  Cheap too.
This is a rip off from the Steelie [...]. Don't be fooled. Cheap and junk. Order the real thing instead.
Good purchase! A bit unfitting but works good enough!
"This case fits the OnePlus One phone perfectly.  I think that it will protect the phone in the event of it being dropped, which is why I purchased it.  (I hope not to find out if it will, I hope I will not drop it!!)  Following the directions, the case is easy to install, and the screen saver protects from scratches to the screen.  The only issue that I have experienced is a relatively minor one, but is a little frustrating.  The hinged snap in protector for the charging port does not easily &#34;snap&#34; into place, and pops open too often, especially when moving the phone into or out of your pocket, for example. It is a good value, but it would be nice if the port cover would work correctly."
"Pretty, but flimsy."
"It is a good case but it does have a lot of flaws. They put the speaker in the wrong place, so the actual speaker on the phone is not protected the phone case is really really hard to get on and you can't take it off with out breaking the case and the silencer on the side, there is no way of turning that on and one more thing that drives me crazy is that the plastic on the screen that covers it is really loose so if you want to type you have to push harder then normal to get the right letters in but other then that it's a good phone case."
Works perfect! Arrived exactly as described with stylus pen. :)
Protects whole phone doesn't leave sticky film after!
"The picture is a thin film that peels easily, the case itself however is strong all around."
High quality and makes me confident about the security of my phone while using.
"These cable are amazing.  They are made solid!  I don't think the USB plug ends will ever loosen up, and the braided sheathing should give this cable years of useful life.  I plan to order more soon."
"I drop things, a lot, and this case has done it's job multiple times. I highly recommend it. I work in an assembly plant and I don't worry about breaking my phone with this case."
"Be aware though, there is nothing high speed about this."
These are the best moderately priced headphones I could find that had android volume controls.
The item is very bad quality..the glue is worst quality..i followed all the instructions and i was about to break my phone the next day because the glue went off. I don't recommend this item to anyone.. i consider my money was thrown in the air.
"Good cable that seems very robust, it's pretty thick but the head that plugs into the phone isn't any larger that the OEM cable so it still fits phones that have cases.  Edit 9/7/15: I seem to have reviewed a little early. Today I noticed that the head of the cable is separating from the cable and exposing the wire underneath. I contacted Amazon support and over the course of 23 minutes (on chat) got the same as others: the cable is more than 30 days old and can't be returned, after explaining (3 times) that I wasn't trying to return and that I wanted it exchanged I was told that they would create an &#34;exception&#34; to allow me to return it. I then told the chat rep that I would pick it up later with phone support. I offered the option of upgrading me to the &#34;fixed&#34; version of this cable and I would pay the difference, but was rejected.  I'm not sure if even updating this review is worth it as it looks like this product is no longer available, but I'll update it just in case it does become available again.  Amazon, get your issues sorted out on Amazon Basic warranties. You are the &#34;manufacturer&#34; and dealer for this product, you should be able to get this figured out. You as a company also need to get your reps on one page with regards to this issue."
Impossible to apply
Good one.
Very nicely constructed simple case. Needed a smaller case to go along with my heavy duty hard sided case that holds all mounts. This will hold the essentials for a quick grab and go. using Hero 3 black edition with this case.
a tool in the set did take off the back screw down on my watch but I have not used many of the tools from the set. they lok funtional though. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the next time i use a tool.
I love my case. Just what I wanted.
It stays clipped to your pocket good and has a nice grip. Only gripe is that the kick stand is a little awkward and the grip on the inside of the holder catches the case when your taking it out.
Now I am a certified iTech.  I love this product
"This is a great case, especially for the price. I consistently drop my phone and have had no issue with the case coming apart or breaking."
"gift for grandson, he loves it"
Same original equipment that came with phone.
"This case is awesome.  I didn't know what to expect when I ordered it.  But I love this case.  I closes with Allen head screws, has an almost glass type cover and is so heavy duty it is a wonderfully well made and durable case, made to last and take a beating."
If you work out and sweat daily then these overpriced earbuds are not for you. I did not get mine from Amazon I got mine from Best Buy with a 2 year extended warranty and that was only a month and a half ago and they've broken on me twice already I feel like I spend more time driving to Best Buy then working out!
Great
Extremely quick shipping. Product is as advertised. Strange thing...shipping information still says this product is still in route to be delivered on future date. Product is definitely a good buy in every aspect. Thanks!
"I got my pair on Prime Day right after the prime stock ran out. Mine came from China, and included Chinese packaging, instructions, etc. Everything about the headphones looks great. Unfortunately, the sound quality is terrible. Everything sounds really canned, and I've tested with multiple devices as well as against other pairs of headphones. In addition, the microphone is worthless for a smartphone because every time I've attempted to use it whoever was on the other end was bombarded by other noise in the room.  I've heard elsewhere that there are companies cloning these headphones, so I should've expected this."
Great
Love It!!
Another great case from elago.
"I use this on my note 4 and my s6 edge plus and it works just like the factory charger.  I bought 2 of them, one for each vehicle. Awesome product. Would recommend for anyone that has a phone that can utilize the quick charge 2.0."
"Everything about this portable battery is great. It's packaged and feels like high-end electronic without the high-end price. It's solid and performs great, we tested it out by charging both of our Moto X's overnight. The next day it still had all 3 of its battery level lights on, can't wait to see how many charges we can get out of it on our phones before we need to plug it in again!<br /><br />Speaking of lights, this thing has a flashlight function as well! I had no idea this was a feature until I'd already ordered it and having since tried it out, it's a great little feature that will be handy on our next camping trip."
"Won't charge my phone. Had to get a 2.4amp USB auto charger. Should have paid more attention when purchasing, I believe this is just a 1.2amp USB."
It is useful when you exercise.<br />Do not go heavily into the pocket.<br />And you can use both hands freely.<br />Especially if you like jogging would be a very useful item.<br />Thanks to the secret deal club who can experience inexpensive.
... Anything else is a total waste of money.  Sound quality is high and the cord is very durable.
Love the case.  Suction cup came out but still stays closed so that's fine.  Strange almost undetectable magnet or something inside lower flap door where credit card goes.  Not sure why it's there... but case does the job nicely.
"It came with no instructions on how to use the Bluetooth remote. I finally figured out how to use it and then found out the remote was broken, it did not work at all. The selfie stick isnt as good as they said it was. I put my phone in the place was supposed to be and it kept swiveling around. I am very unsatisfied with my purchase."
Case showed up quickly and I love it!  Great for my work.  Fully protects phone (don't think it would survive a hard fall however) but it's NOT bulky and small enough to use comfortably.  Well done manufacturer!
Good product as advertised
Very good case long lasting
Great screen protector! It is not really thick so it looks nice on the phone. Barely noticeably on the phone.
"Good product, not perfect, but none have been, to date. A hint about separating the well made halves would have been helpful for the age and experience impaired ;)"
"I really enjoy this radio. but the down fall is that I don't know how to program this radio.<br />The price is great, and it's great for airsoft games or any other activities."
It Works Just Like The Original...I Love Anker Products!!! This Is My 10th Item Bought From Them With Absolutely No Complains..
"Arrived quickly, works well and is quite stylish. Just so you know, the funny little plastic piece connected to the lanyard is designed to plug into the headphone jack to help keep track of the stylus."
Amazing phone & for the price that I got it for (69.99) I surely cannot complain. Love it....Thanks PCS Wireless...
"Already having problems with this cord. The last one I purchased lasted 2 years, which is why I felt confident ordering another. I'm getting the &#34;this accessory may not be supported&#34; message on my iPhone and I'm waking up with a phone that isn't charged...."
good working car charger I have used it only twice seems to be doing its job
"Between everyone in my house, we use a lot of headphones and seem to go through them pretty frequently because we were buying inexpensive ones. I had the opportunity to get these and so far they work great and feel they will last a while. I use them for online lectures for school, and I listen to them with a bunch of kids running around and I can honestly say they do a good job at canceling out the outside noise. It's not completely silent but it's definitely not distracting. The only thing I would have liked to see with these is extra ear buds (or whatever they're called). You get one size, so it's not easy for my kids to use because it doesn't fit in their ears very well.  Other than that, they are a good, quality set of headphones and are comfortable to wear. **i did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback."
"After researching the reviews, I ordered two cables.  These are everything the great reviews claim them to be.  As a matter of fact, count me among the reviewers who claim them to be sturdier and more substantial than the original cables that came with our iPhones.  The added length is a huge bonus, as well.  I'll be ordering more soon."
Their colors are really nice and they fit the iPhone.<br />I have been using them for a year now and they still look great.<br />I recommend them to anybody :)
As advertised.
Awesome
Great quality
"This is an absolutely stunning case. The colors are incredibly vibrant and look painted on the back of this case. The silicone makes it easy to put on your phone and it's a soft case so no hard edges jabbing at you if you are like me and tend to put your phone in your back pocket. I like that it is a thinner case so it's not to bulky and it's easier to hold for someone like me with smaller hands. This case is definitely a great deal at less than $10. This is one of those cases that you will be so pleased with, you may never want to change it.<br /><br />I received this free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
i have had this on my phone for about 3 months and works great!! it's so cheap and works great! five stars
Very nice case and still shows off my d Brand skin.
It is too small for the above phone. It is very difficult to take the phone out
love it
cool colors and patterns - it's fun to mix and match outifts
It works so good
Wasn't the one I wanted
Great product! Supports rapid charging on the Note 4.
softer plastic and still holds phone
Its a very nice protector
"Upgraded from a G3 (not from Amazon, sorry - went to the local Blue Box store)<br /><br />It's a good phone - makes & receives phone calls extremely well - depending on signal strength.<br />  Camera is awesome<br />  You can add an SD card for additional storage<br />  You can change the battery (I recommend getting one from LG with the charger for it)<br />  Music sounds good<br /><br />Cons<br />  Seems to limited to Google browsing. I tried a couple others, including my favorite Firefox & they just seem to bog down.<br />  The leather back looks cool, but when I have it on, my soft case doesn't stay on very well. I drop things - need that baby buggy bumper.<br /><br />Big Con - What engineer decided to put the on/off button in the middle of the volume up/down buttons? Am I the only one who goes to raise the volume on a song & puts my phone to sleep?  Or, in the process of turning the phone &#34;on/off&#34; during a day, eventually turns the volume down so low, I miss the &#34;important&#34; call from my wife?<br /><br />Lately - trying to put the phone to sleep with the on/off button takes a screenshot ?????<br /><br />Come on LG - get some engineer who have to live with fat fingers like the rest of us."
"As advertised, protect the phone well. Strange construction, not a knockoff."
Works fine.
son loves it.
"This is a 15,000 mah portable battery pack. Just to give you some comparisons, an iphone 6 has 1800 mah, and a nexus 6 has around 3000 mah. So that should give you an idea of how much this should charge your phones. One thing about the current generation of battery packs is that they are &#34;smart&#34; charging, meaning they will slow down charging when it nears a full phone charge.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't have a quick charge phone, but I wish I did because it seems like a nice feature. Fast charging. It is marked by an orange port (like it is on all other Aukey devices). The nexus 6 does have quick charging, but I don't have one unfortunately.  Other than that, the two ports work as normal ports up to 2 amps, which is good for tablets and phablets.<br /><br />15,000 is amazing. I have a 20,000 mah one from another company that is a lot bigger and heavier. This has a built in flashlight as well (like many other battery packs that are on the market).<br /><br />I would recommend using a 2 amp charger, which this battery has, to ensure faster recharge time on the battery pack. at 1 amp, it would be a bit slow. Charging is via a micro usb cable, which is standard with most android phones.<br /><br />Overall, it is a nice, well designed, and functional battery pack that has many uses and is being added to replace some smaller battery packs in my travel arsenal.<br /><br />Item was provided for unbiased review."
Works perfectly! The AC power means I can run all 4 of my portable USB hard drives without a problem.
"UPDATE: After owning this for some time, I will upgrade from a 2 star to a 4 star. The quality is great, it has had no issues and it still looks brand new. I would give it 5 stars if they would have sent me what they send they would.<br /><br />Ok. I think this product is just ok. I feel a little bothered that this product must have changed design from its first go round. This product i received is the one shown - however - if you read the reviews below and look at the images it is clearly a different band. It seems like version one was much closer to the Apple band with the magnetic clasp and infinity design. This one I received - no. It has a gap between the watch and the band and has a clasp instead of magnet. The material is ok. I feel some rough edges (very minor). The brushed stainless looks good but the clasp that attached to the apple watch isn't brushed as nice so you can see a big difference. It was not as easy to on the watch, but I did finally get it to fit on. Overall, I think it will work. I would give it 3 stars if the product was consistent with the pictures other people posted. My suggestion is to discontinue this product number and start fresh so purchasers are not confused. It is clear this was a different product before."
"seriously, save your money! It works great, but doesn't work with My Fitness Pal or phone therefore the number of steps you don't transfer over and I ended up with 4 different apps which I just wanted one app to do everything. Get the FitBit Zip, more money but worth it!"
love it
"Fits amazing, looks amazing, but the back is a FINGER PRINT MAGNET. Which I can not stand. Might be returning."
Worked fine for a month
Excellent A+++++ Product....I am very happy
"its the best and beautiful case, whatever it change to yellow some days later, but its so nice"
"Great product and easy to apply if you follow the directions! This protector really does what it is intended to do, I dropped my phone and the screen protector cracked but the actually screen is completely fine. Definitely worth it!!"
Can't give this a 5 star since I screwed up installing this.  It would have worked had I not cut the connection for the touchscreen.  I will have to purchase a new screen and start over. I think installation was quite easy but it would have helped having instructions to guide me through.
"Fits great, looks cool and slim.Haven't dropped phone yet to see how well it protects."
Looks nice and authentic. Plus it works really good. I'm satisfied as it is.
love it..its hard case and its nice..high quality...got discount for my honest review
was broken very fast and not function.
"Bought 2 and both ended up chipping and breaking.  I thought that maybe I did something to break the first one, but after purchasing the second on and putting a case on, it ended up chipping the three different places.  Totally disappointed."
Very high quality product! So easy to install and gives crystal clear view! I applied it while husband was driving so it's that easy with no bubbles to apply awesome packaging highly recommend
Great
"Thank you for getting it to me fast, but the phone in obsolete. Just over internal storage or lack there of. Just not capable of operating correctly, can't handle apps and updates.<br />I bought it for a quick fix, when I broke my screen on another phone. Getting ready to go back to broken screen phone for the time being..<br />Waste of money."
Works as advertised. Not too thick either which is good.
"Would be five stars but when it gets hot it does stop working, once cooled off it works great."
It's light weight and perfect! So tired of bulky cases where the auxiliary chord didn't fit and I couldn't screen shot. This one's perfect.
Quality...there is a difference from these to the cheap wires.
"Subtle, lightweight and offers good protection for my S6 active phone and esp. what it lands on."
Very good quality.  Better then the original.
"I absolutely adore Anker's external battery chargers! I had an older version of this battery charger and was forced to upgrade since my previous Anker charger was stolen. Instead of trying out another brand, I already knew what I wanted to buy. :)"
Really satisfied with this item!!  8 yr old grandson dropped iPod in toilet. Was saved by this case!!
Great case that lets my iPhone color shine through.  It does get scratched and the bumper didn't come up high enough to protect the glass shield I had used for extra protection for the screen.  I removed the cracked class shield and the phone case has been working perfectly since then.
"It works, but don't find it to be that great. Reports have indicated that I sound much better via the HT; furthermore, the speaker, within the unit, puts out muffled sound. I would not recommend this product."
Adhered to the screen all by itself. No rubbing necessary. Amazing!
Everything was great
good for price
Great product and they have an awesome warranty for it in case any issues ever come up
"I've received my armor mine speaker. I like it. It seems to have a pretty good battery life and the sound is good for the size. It seems durable although I haven't really put it to the test.<br /><br />One suggestion, when I increase the volume, when it reaches its max, if you press the volume button again the music goes silent and it beeps at you, after beeping the music starts again. Still this is annoying and unnecessary. I also didn't see much of an indication of wether or not it was fully charged as the light never changed. So I charged it for a couple hours and the battery lasted days.<br /><br />It's a cool invention, and the price is great"
always cheapest through amazon. crisp clear and no static. multi-functional as stated.
Works great
"This is and will be the only case I put on my G6. I love this case its strong and sleek. I have dropped my phone 3 times since owning it and I have not noticed any cracks on my phone nor on the case! I got stickers and put one on each backing and switch them out each week. I love the gold, silver, and slate color. The phone fits perfect in all my pockets. Geez I can't say how awesome this case is!!!"
"Works just as advertised.  Easy to use, fits both Galaxy 5 and iPhones.  Charges quickly and is a great gift for children or adults.  Plan to purchase several for Christmas Presents."
"Absolutely adore this case. Cute color, easy storage. Wish the front part of the case was white or same color blue though."
"Great product ,works very good !"
Good one.
It has never worked.!!!
"Great product, but terrible shipping methods.  It took 10 days to receive the case, all because I wouldn't buy into Amazon's prime program.  Disappointed with Amazon's tactics of making you wait unless you buy-in oppressive shipping rates or their high priced Prime deal.<br /><br />FWIW the case fits perfectly on my Xperia Z3v."
Love the case. Color is spot on
"This is only the 2nd selfie stick I've ever used and this one is way better quality then the first one I tried. The first one was bought at Rue 21 for $5 and didn't have anything that connects to your phone so you had to set a timer to take a picture and the part that is supposed to hold the phone didn't even hold it so it usually fell out before the picture was even taken. With the Kiwii Selfie Stick, the part that is supposed to hold the phone actually holds it in place. It also has a cord that plugs into your headphone jack that allows you to take a picture by pressing the button at the bottom of the stick. I had planned on giving this selfie stick to my nieces as a gift but after using it a few times I think I'm going to keep it and just by them a different one! The picture below shows what was in the box when I received it.<br /><br />I received this selfie stick free for review purposes but all opinions are my own honest and unbiased thoughts on the product."
I gotta say love the camouflage design as well as protecting my phone
I am impressed...this small soap-like object really holds a charge.
"Really disappointed in this case. Its a cute case but the gold part kept slipping off. I only had it for about 1 week before it fell and I didn't realize it and lost the part. So this case had to go right in the trash can. I wish it would have fit the phone better. I'm disappointed that I wasted $15 for a cute case that I couldn't use anymore because the case size was wrong. And yes, I did order the right case for my phone. The length fit but the width didn't. The gold part barely clicked into place with the teal part when it arrived."
Great product!
Was disappointed when they wouldn't connect with Siri on my phone.
Great product and really small like an hearing aid size
Absolutely beautiful highly recommend
"Great case itself! But too many problems. One, the headphone jack was too small and so i bought a thin jack extender which was pointless cuz it still wouldnt fit. Two, the silent on and off button was way to narrow. Three, the charging cord was too much of a problem and only was able to use the iphone charger. Four, the price and quality is great but not worth it for the problems that comes with it"
Works perfectly! Very pleased with this transaction.
Great device. Works well.
Love this power!
"A quality design and usefulness. I have several cables attached to it for convenience... iPhone, iPad 2, Fitbit, and ports for more items if needed."
"The rubber cover never fit just right, but I like it. Trimming a small piece of cloth for between the phone and the caes would keep the phone scratch free. The case fits exactly to the phone, so daily dirt gets in there and scratches the back."
the cable didn't fit my iphone as promised.
Fit is not quite as great as the Commuter for the Iphone 3GS from a few years back. The case is a good compromise between protection and bulk.
Works great
Fits perfectly and does not interfere with phone capabilities.
"Love it, very light."
love
Attach perfectly to the phone and seems durable
"This product does not work. Don't waste your money & time. Don't believe the positive reviews written on this product, as it is completely false. Amazon should remove such products from it's site."
VERY NICE GOOD PRICE
I really like the case. I also feel it really protects my phone. Only reason I give 4 stars is because the &#34;glitter&#34; design is not realistic. Also the protective screen sometimes prevents fast keystrocks.
no it took forever to charge my phone up. it always said 5 hours to charge and have my phone over heated.
Works well so far.  Will update if anything goes wrong with it.
I had my phone for less than a week before the screen cracked. The phone does not have enough screen protection with this case. I would highly recommend spending the extra money on stronger case
I've gotten lots of compliments on it and it fits nicely. I'm obsessed with Dalí and it makes a good ice breaker.
Works good
"Like the case. It's comfortable in the hand, the buttons work well, and most importantly the phone feels protected. It's not the most aesthetically pleasing case... Wish UAG wasn't stamped so prominently on the back"
Fits my iPhone 6 snugly.
My only complaint is people who call me say they can't hear me well.
Fit really good
"Was purchased as a Christmas give. What a piece of junk...when it was opened on Christmas it looked great. When it was activated 2 days later, it showered why it was &#34;used&#34;. Junk is junk. Waisted my money on that one."
"Phone charging cable. Exactly as advertised, and durable, doesnt feel cheap."
"Works great, will provide excellent support to the Heil Broadcast boom which is big!"
worked great
"This is the charger to have in your glove box of your car or boat. All you need to charge this charger is the sun, no matter where you are you can usually see the sun. "
No bubbles and extremely easy to use
Great parts. Thanks.
"Works great, what else can I say?"
"I love my new iPhone case, it's exactly what I wanted. Delivery was so fast, I would recommend Amazon to my family & friends ❤️"
"I love this product.  I have a Samsung Note 4, & I hate cases because they make the already large phone too bulky for my liking.  The iRing gives maximum versatility as a kickstand in multiple positions.  It allows me to carry the phone across my knuckles & still have both hands available.  iRing also sits the camera lens above the table so you avoid scratches to the camera lens.  Great purchase."
Very nice product.  I highly recommend.
"This is an almost indestructible plastic cover, and almost no bubbles.  My copy created a permanent bubble around the rear-facing camera, I think because of the camera indention.  The OEM protector was cut around that camera.<br /><br />The first one arrived badly smashed - this is a ridged piece, not a thin film, and someone sat something heavy on it in-transit.  The second was intact and I like it.  It replaced the wimpy one that came on the phone, and within weeks had scratches on it.<br /><br />Forget those three-packs of thin film, this is the kind of protector that works.  Wonder if they make one for a Nikon...."
Very durable cable I would definitely buy again.
Ear hooks be within 1 week.
Great headphones work really well.
Great camera worked very well .Thanks.
"Product arrived quickly, quick to install and works perectly with my Galaxy S 5."
Best I've been using it for days
AAA+++!!!
Great
"I would give it 5 stars, if it had a magnet in there to turn the screen on and off automatically upon opening/closing. I was able to glue a magnet in myself to have this function. Otherwise, it works great and saves me from carrying an extra wallet around."
Works so much like my jiake phone I just love it.the price was great. Best priced product for the specs and promotional offers
They are super long. I love them and love the colors.
protects well
Not comfortable.The wires are too stiff and wide to make the earbuds feel invisible.
"Easy to install, HD clarity.came with alcohol swab and microfiber cleaning cloth to clean the screen prior to apply the screen protector. This is good one to use for cell phone. I like this and recommend as well."
"Great case. I have my own landscaping business and have a tendency to drop my phone, run it over with a mower tire, get caught in the rain, etc. This case has protected it from everything. Took one star away because the built-in screen protector feels pretty cheap but still works."
"I received this product in exchange for a unbiased review, the shipping was fast and packaged securely the instructions were easy to follow and this screen protector fit my device perfectly. all ports and speakers work properly, fingerprints are easy to wipe off. i put on a case right afterwards and the screen protector didn’t  interfere made of durable materials and keeps my screen safe from damage. nice price for the durability and quantity"
"Love The New Headphones , They Are Really Loud And Fashonable 😍😍"
Very good
The phone glitches when it is plugged and you are using it. Not good.
great buy super fast shipping a+++
Great product....love it & arrived much sooner than stated......
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
"Terrible pieceo f junk. Has never worked to actually charge a phone. Phone will occasionally make a 'hissing' sound when it seems like it is lining up with the device to charge. Battery level does not increase. Attempted to charge Nexus 5, 6, & 7 with the device and none would charge.<br /><br />Avoid this."
"Fast Shipping / Good battery, very useful - Recommend it."
"im surprised by the exceptional quality of this car charger. the included usb cable is also well made. top port is for standard charge. the bottom port provides a faster charge. small, sleek, and works well!"
"Awesome speaker, I love it....Sounds clear and loud enough....Perfect personal space speaker."
Exactly What I Wanted.
"I originally ordered this because my partner had used it in his car and it worked very well for the iPhone 6. When I originally purchased it, the product fell apart after just a few uses and the mechanism that goes into the vent was very loose. I was really disappointed and decided to contact Koomus customer service about the issue. AMAZING! They responded within minutes via email letting me know they would be sending a replacement out. I received the replacement a few days later and it works very well, just as I hoped it would. I believe the first one I ordered was just a manufacturer's defect.<br /><br />It fits snug into the vent, holds the phone securely and it's even easy to swivel while in place. Overall great product and amazing customer service."
Product as described fast shipping
Great radio!!!
"I bought One case from such seller,but water entered on my cell,and my phone was not working any more,but the seller did nothing only pay for the money of the case about 35.99 $!"
Terrible period.
One of the cords suddenly quit working within 2 weeks of purchase
It's a stylus.
Glad to find the ones for my phone.... Up until now I have been cutting out my own... Really Happy!
Very pleased with my purchase!  Item is exactly as described. Much better car charger than what the cell phone companies try to sell you when you purchase your phone.
"This is very cute, but the bow kept falling off even though I super glued it back on several times."
Wokrs great
Quick delivery and love the color!!
Excellent
Bought this for my mother-in-law as a replacement battery to her T-Mobile MyTouch Q. It worked perfectly and the phone isn't dying in ten seconds anymore
Great Product
"Fits nicely came fast, hard to take off."
Very nice device. I'm actually buying another one.
Love it!
great deal! probably best to bring inside off season.
Works as expected. Unfortunately the metal clip may give your skin a rash if you are allergic to certain alloys. Even with that I can't complain at the price.
I had this professionally installed. As soon I played the first song it sounded like the voice coil was blown. I've messed around with the different levels so much and it still sounds like complete sh*t. Such a waste of money. Hundreds of dollars spent on this just to be used for a month then disconnected and put away in a closet.
"pretty good product, as a Soldier that just used this in the field recently this came in very handy. Product was durable as it was banged around in the vehicle.  No issues with the seller and I look forward to dealing with the seller in the future for future field product.  I actually have Army buddies that are interested in purchasing one for themselves.  Guess whole squad will have one then the platoon.  That's how good the product is.  I guess you can say its Soldier tested and Soldier approved."
Shipped faster than expected. Love the colors.
"Haven't dropped the phone to really test out the case, but it certainly seems rugged.  The texture makes it easier to keep a good grip on the phone."
"Great price, quick service and fast delivery. Would order again."
Love it
I've had my jawbone UP24 for about a month. So far I love everything except the food tracker. It's difficult to figure out and not as accurate as it should be.
for a fair review they provided me with a discount code. great product
This product seems to have more interference then the transmitter I had for my old I phone 4.
It's not as private as some but it doesn't have the annoying little lines in it that others have. Excellent product!!!!
Love it
Great price and work great
I am happy with this product so far.  Easy to pair easy to use.  Sound quality is good and the fit is comfortable for my ears.  I wish they had it available for left ear as I have some hearing loss in right ear but that would be my only issue.
Great for walking so I'm not holding my phone any more!
Good screen protector
"The electronic equipment working only for 4 days, is of very poor quality. No recommend"
Great my daughter loves it
It is just like the factory one I lost.
Neat addition for my vivofti2
I returned this. I dropped my phone from barely 4 feet off the ground and my entire screen shattered. I would say if you are going to use this case get a tempered-glass screen protector because it's NOT a hard case. I upgraded to the otterbox commuter...
Works great the cutouts are a little off but nothing moving it a little further to one side won't fix.
It was great and I loved it
Ordered 2 of these. Both Stylist are bent
"Arrived  supper fast. .<br />Definitely Waterproof<br />Only downside was the cover is huge, other than that its a great product for such a decent price."
First screen protector was damaged in shipment (I guess). Top left corner did not set to screen. Explained situation to Maxboost.  They replaced it immediately.  Replacement fits perfectly. They stand behind their product. Very satisfied.
I love this case!!  I had the bigger Otterbox case and it was too bulky for my taste but this is perfect.  It has even taken a tumble down a flight of stairs and there is only a scratch on the phone case and my iPhone had no damage.  Will be purchasing more.
Works Good. As Advertised..  :-)
I put this in my 2011 genesis coupe and it hits super hard not too much though still sounds clean. I highly recommend
Seems sturdy but the case covers the audio input.
Terrible
"Super thin, lightweight, and non intrusive. Feels amazing, isn't add protective as other cases but I get to enjoy and show off my phone more."
Very good fit
Still have my otter box. I have dropped my phone several times. I have even stepped on my phone and there has been no damage thanks to this otter box. I only wish I had not have gotten white though.. it stains easily.
Phone always gets hot sitting on the dash in the sun.
Great phone!
Great for  the price.  Very happy with it
"I can't tell you how many screens i have cracked previously, it's happened at least twice on every phone i've ever owned, and i also have an infant that likes to play with my phone and drop it also, and since i decided to try this out, NOT ONE SCRATCH! everything is still in great condition, should have tried this a long time ago!"
"Device worked great for me. Right out of the box, charged my phones multiple times as a test, performed like a champ. One of the best deals out there for $/capacity/quality"
Convenient to use
They worked
"Like it a lot, but have to agree with an earlier reviewer who mentioned that the groove for propping up the tablet is a little too shallow to keep the tablet upright securely.  Minor point.  The stylus is handy at times."
It was for the wrong phone. It may stay for a one plus one but it looks like it would fit an iPhone 6. It was a beautiful case now looked at it and it looks like it would fit my phone but it didn't.
did not last 6 months
The silicone skin was good!
"Wife and daughter use one of the larger battery power banks, that are good for 3-4 charges, but size is a pain to lug around.  I wanted something smaller in size and weight, just good enough for one charge.  This power bank fits the bill, have already put to use a couple times when sightseeing and smartphone was running low after many pictures, googling for maps, and other uses.  Easy to recharge, extremely satisfied."
"Easy application for my pebble time. No bubbles, clear coating, great peace of mind now that my screen is protected!"
I was very happy with my watch.
Can't beat the price for such a high-quality product.
The cable is the Samsung OEM cable and works perfectly.
Phone can only sit one way which I didn't realize. It is small and easy to transport and does work. Bendable and made easy to position to how you want it positioned. Actually quite convent to use.
"Product was well made. I have only had for a couple days so I can't speak for durability but it would appear to be a quality product.<br /><br />The ability to go from lightning to mini USB is a nice feature.<br /><br />I will probably keep this in my bag as a backup cable because it is functional for several purposes. But for my primary charger cables I wouldn't want/need the extra charging type.<br /><br />And finally, the LED light. It is a nice feature and it is extremely bright in a dark room. I like my bedroom completely dark so I can't use this for my overnight charger. But it works great if you need to find your phone at night or if you need a night light!"
"Perfect case. It is incredibly thin, looks excellent, and provides great protection for your phone. You really couldn't ask for more out of a case. I would pick it over Otterbox every time."
product is as advertised
"I've had this for about 3 months.  The case itself is unobtrusive, and I've noticed no degradation to the phone's performance.  My phone dropped 3 feet out of our truck and onto a paved parking lot today.  It bounced around several times, and I was cringing with every bounce.  The case protected it 100%, with no cracks or scratches whatsoever.  The case saved my $500 phone, which is why I bought it, so giving it an enthusiastic 5 stars.  At first I thought I'd got what I expected with the screen protector.  It was all scratched and lifting at the edges.  Finally I decided to just take it off ... and ... MY BAD; there was a thin cover over the screen protector!  With that taken off, the screen protector performs just as well as the Zagg protectors I like to buy, maybe even better."
My son just got the S6 and he is required to have a durable case on it at all times. I use this case for my S5 so it was an east decision to buy. No complaints. Thought the S6 is about the same size w/o case as my S5 with cases on the newer Defender seems a bit smaller and lighter. We weighed the bare phones and they are nearly identical in both size and weight. I have to conclude the OB found a way to make the cases less intrusive in size/weight while offering the same protection and quality of materials. :)
"I  like  this  phone  better  than  the  gusto 3  ( newest model )  ,  chiefly  because  of  the  speaker  phone  is  much  crisper  in  sound  quality..."
My husband has been using this with his Galaxy for several weeks now.  It's perfect as his phone overheats frequently on long trips so he can keep it cool in front of the vent.  It holds his phone and my iPhone 5S perfectly.  My only complaint would be that it leans forward some but it really isn't a big deal.
it didn't fit well.  It looked nice but extremely hard to put on.  I thought either my phone was going to break or the cover was.
Garbage product. Did not protect phone at all.
Excellent securing this unit on my windshield to hold my cell phone when traveling
Loving it in every way. With the small exception that it doesn't have a hourly chime at the top of each hour. But a small price to pay. But no real complaints.
Good product.
Fell apart in less than 30 Days. Left earphone broke off. Held by small piece of plastic. DO NOT BUY.
works well
"I have been using the vibe for awhile now and I love it. It doesn't feel overpowering or impairing like energy drinks or alcohol or rx meds. I don't enjoy the side effects of either and tend to stay far away from them. Which is super important to me bc I am a stay at home mom trying to keep up with some really rambunctious kids but also keep my sanity. Sure, after a really long day with crabby toddlers I slap a calm strip on and feel like I have been sent to cloud 9. No glass of wine can do this, and I am so happy it's my own body's response rather than alcohol destroying my body. I leave the settings at 50% bc much higher I get the tingle feeling in my scalp. Otherwise, no issues. This thing is awesome!"
"no stars, terrible sound, no one can hear me on my phone with this case."
"Screen protector is very sticky and I can't use volume, or power buttons."
I like the case.  Hopefully it will protect the phone like advertised.
"I love this case! Can't beat the price, and it's one of the thinnest iPhone cases I've found. It's not protective, but that's not what I was looking for in a case. If you want something thin, lightweight, and flexible, this is the case for you.<br />It also came with a screen protector. I don't use them, but I thought it was nice, especially since the case was only $6.<br /><br />Another nice touch: it has flaps that cover the charging port and headphone jack. This case feels well made and not cheap at all.<br /><br />Again, it's NOT meant to be a protective case, but it is an amazing decorative case!"
Works grear
This screen protector fit perfectly on the LG Utimate 2 and was easy to apply.  It definitely protects the screen and keeps it clean and smear proof.
Great! Love the accessories it comes with
"Thin case, fits perfect"
Excellent
"It is not for iphone 5, it has an adapter and that's not what they're selling with that picture."
"I don't understand the negative reviews on this product. I bought this item and took it to a professional to install it for me. After installation, I left the store a happy camper. The GPS worked without any issues, the back up camera worked without any issues., the system worked without issues Everything worked as expected. This is the best stereo you can buy for the buck. I think that the issue is that people try to install it by themselves and end up not installing it right. Mine works excellently with no complaints at all. If you want your system to work well, take it to a professional that knows what he/she is doing. This is the best equipment I have ever bought and was 100% happy. When my radio or GPS is on and I put my car in reverse, the back up camera comes on and when I put my car in drive, the backup  camera goes off while my radio or my CD or my GPS is still on. I don't have to do anything to make it work. In summary, if you want your unit to work well, take it to a professional and I promise you will be glad you did."
It fit well.
"When it comes to electronics, I have always gone with this motto: &#34;The more you invest, the longer you'll have it.&#34; So naturally when buying earphones, I figured instead of buying the cheap $5 ones, I'll go ahead and spend a little bit more. I mean, I paid $25 for these and that is a little up there for earphones. Everyone I know buy the $10 ones from Walmart. This is the first time I have regretted following my motto. I ordered the black ones when it read &#34;still in stock,&#34; and then three weeks later they said they only had the silver/white ones and asked if they could just ship me those instead. I replied with &#34;Okay, I would rather have white earphones as opposed to none.&#34; They sent them to me and I received them the next week. The plastic baggie they came in had been opened, but they looked clean and unused so I gave them a try. Not even two months later, they are just dirty (they are dirt magnets) and the microphone doesn't even work. Further more, the &#34;noise-cancelling&#34; earbud set that comes with them are EXTREMELY uncomfortable and aren't even effective. My sister was on her side of the bedroom and she could hear my music even at the recommended volume. Remember when I said I didn't want to buy cheap $5 earphones earlier in this review? Well, like I said, I paid $25 for these and I received earphones with $5 quality anyway. I might as well have saved myself $20.00 and bought the cheap $5 earphones!!!"
Daughter loves it
Awesome product!! I put on my dashboard weeks ago and it has not moved an inch! It stays in place and I used it as a cell phone holder I can stop suddenly as well as go over bumps and my phone does not move at all. Great product for those who are always using their phone or needing it while in the car and can never find it with this product you put it there and it's always in the right place!! I received this I. Exchange for review great product!!
"works fine, no problem thanks."
Great case fit perfect
This was a gift for a friend. She loves it and it was shipped in record time. Thanks...
Too flimsy
"I love, love, love my Samsung Gear Fit!  It is the coolest thing ever!  Now, I’m no workout guru or some extreme techie, but for this being my first techie watch that connects to my cell phone, this is the Coolest!!!  It is extremely user friendly and easy to learn.  It is sharp looking and a lot of fun.  It fits nice on the wrist too!<br /><br />But first, let me say that I bought the Samsung Gear Fit for the purpose of tracking my sleep, which to be honest, only tracks movement, so it is limited, but it gives you the general idea of your sleep pattern, which when viewed on your phone shows your peak times of movement.  Very Cool!<br /><br />The other cool thing is that it will let you know when you get an email, text, call or voicemail.  You can see who the communication is from and can read the messages, plus you can respond with short prerecorded messages.  The standard replies are on your phone or you can create your own.  And, if you get a call on your cell phone, you can reject it without having to dig your phone out of your purse or pocket.  Very Cool!  These weren't the reasons why I got my Gear Fit, but since I work where cell phones are only permitted in the break room, I now know when I get an important message that I have to respond to.  Also, the Bluetooth goes far.  I charge my phone overnight in the kitchen on the first floor, but still get updates on my Gear Fit in my bedroom on the second floor.<br /><br />And, much too my surprise, after a few days I thought, the only thing missing on this thing was the weather.  Well, after having more time to play with it, there are different clock options, one showing a current weather icon (sun, cloud, moon, etc.) with the temperature, which is updated when your phone is updated.  WooHoo, that made my day!<br /><br />I haven’t used the workout options, yet.  Nor, have I used the media controller, but it also seems very cool.  The heart rate monitor has only been a beat off from the monitor that you use onyour finger.  And, the phone finder is a nice added bonus.<br /><br />Now, I read some of the reviews and I see folks complaining about the chrome peeling off.  I've had my watch for exactly a month and have worn it constantly.  The chrome has not peeled; however, I don't wear the watch in the shower and I push it up my wrist when I'm in water, such as when washing dishes.  So, I think a little discretion has to be used to keep it looking good as new.  I do have to say that it sits a little high and I have bumped it on a wall, but no scratches or broken glass.  In fact, the only scratches are on the Samsung silver logo on the bottom of the Gear Fit band from having my wrist on my desk.<br /><br />Now, there are a couple minor things that would be a nice change:<br /><br />1)  It’s a bit of a pain to confirm that your deleting a message from your Gear Fit each time you do; i.e., you hit the trash can to delete a message, then you have to hit the check-mark to confirm that it will be deleted.  I think that if you accidentally delete a message, it’s no big deal since the message stays on your phone.  If anything, it should give you the option in the settings to choose if you want to confirm that you’re deleting a message or maybe give it the five-second rule, like it’s done on my Samsung Mini, to cancel the deletion.<br /><br />2)  I love the countdown timer, but I wish you could set more than one time at a time.  For instance, I get a 5-minute break, 15-minute break and a 30-minute lunch.  It would be really cool to be able to save more than one setting at a time.  Say, that you could preset three and then choose the one you want when you need it, or give preset options such as 5, 15, 30, etc., but with the ability to change it by a minute with the +/- key to suit specific needs.  For instance, I get a 15 minute break, but I would want the alarm to go off at 13 so I have time to get back to my station; the option would be something like, preset to 15, hit minus key twice to get to 13.  Or, maybe have the ability to set timer options on your phone with the ability to choose the one you want to use like you can when choosing a reply.  Now, I realize this isn't for fitness, but you have to admit, through the course of the day, I have to change the timer to 15, then to 30, then to 15 and last to 5.  Hitting the +/- key 30 times is, well, a hassle. Plus, should I be doing sprints during my workout, I don't want to have to change the timer each time to switch back and forth.<br /><br />3) And last, the only other thing missing is an alarm on the clock!  It would be nice to set an alarm (and, while you’re at it, maybe a snooze).  Given how watches are programmed these days, I think this would be a really easy fix.  After all, it is a watch.<br /><br />So, guys & gals at Samsung, maybe these tiny adjustments can be made in the next upgrade.  Now, wouldn’t that be Really Coooool!!!"
Great band for running!
"My daughter absolutely love these, they are so clear and have so many neat features she loves."
Covers the phone snugly.  Is slim fit and isn't bulky.  Doesn't seem like a lot of protection if you drop the phone.
Fits great easy to adjust bends when I do depending on what exercise I teach.
"I have phone chargers all over the place. I keep a phone charger anywhere I know I'm going to be, and the same goes for hubby and the grand-kids."
Not really a blue. More of a green. Not sure if I like it but we will give it a try.  Came on time. And seems to be very durible.
Very great. It gives 8% extra boost to charge
"Great case looks and feels and fits PERFECTLY, if u need a case this is the one looks like I paid $100 ,it looks that good"
"Love the color and case, one thing i would advise is to put thin flap on card holder to make more secure and then it would get a &#34;10&#34;"
"Overall nice case, protects the screen when it's in my pocket (mainly what I was looking for). My one complaint is the flap that holds the cover shut. The seam at the edge rubs against the phone every time you close it (that tension is what keeps it shut), and seems to be causing quite a bit of wear over a short time (just over a month as of writing), making me question just how long this case will last."
This product arrived looking used and the material was all marked. Very disappointed that for this small product what I must go through to get a refund.After I purchased it I also saw them at the local store for 50% less of what I paid.
Excellent item. God bless you.
"Small phone, don't like it.  Thanks!"
"I have used I don't know how many car chargers (my first one was for a Palm!),  so it isn't that easy for me to be pleasantly surprised (*unpleasantly* surprised, yes, but not pleasantly).  Hi-Mobiler managed it, with this charger they sent me for evaluation and review.<br /><br />First, it's a &#34;smart&#34; charger, meaning that when you plug a device into it, it somehow 'reads' it to learn what the highest amperage it can handle is, then feeds it just that much power.  I have an iPhone 6 and an Android tablet (and a Kindle, and...), and on multiple-port chargers I can never remember which end of the charger has the 1.0mAh port and which end is the 2.0mAh... and they're labeled in print too fine to be read without pulling the thing out of the cigarette lighter (oops-- &#34;power port&#34;) and holding it up under the light.  It's a pain in the backside unalleviated by heated car seats.<br /><br />The ports on the Hi-Mobiler are each labelled 2.4, which is higher than even Apple products require.  With this charger, though, the labels are just decorative-- plug your device into any of the ports and the Smart Charger will simply charge it, at whatever amperage for which the device is rated.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />[I was offered this charger at no cost in exchange for a fair and honest review.]"
Very Nice
excelent<br />20mts dive no problem
Got this for my mom. The install was easy enough. I like how it resists smudges and seems to<br />Hold up better than the other kind of screen protectors. Really nice for the price!  It does seem too thick to use in an otterbox/ life proof case though
Worked GREAT
Easy to install and very good protection. No glare  from it either.
"This was a great purchase. I used this on vacation in Italy with a European power adapter. I was charging two devices every night, one time 3 (all Apple products). No issues with charge time; no issues with heat on the charger. Plugged it in, went to bed, woke up to 100% charge."
"Charges everything so fast it's like magic.  Only one issue, the 12v connector needs a slightly longer connector at the very front.  It looses connection and really has to be jammed in.  I have a Toyota Camery, so it's not like some exotic strange car...  If that front connector stuck out about two more millimeters, it would be a 5-star, no questions..."
This has worked very well for my new iPhone 6 Plus and everything else I need to carry.  I just hope I don't get up and walk away without taking it along with me because it is definitely new for me not to wear my wallet and phone.
Was as advertised.<br />Easy install.<br />Would recommend to others.
For the price its great.
"Works great without adding bulk to original thickness like the qi charging battery cover does, thus giving you more options when it comes to buying cases.  Works great and Chris quickly"
Breaks too easy.
satisfied
"love it I have to dim the light for privacy but , it works"
"Excellent piece of hardware - I am so impressed with the capabilities that the HooToo has file sharing, movie watching, etc.  I am using this as a bridge for my wireless at home and the signal strength and throughput is awesome!"
Perfect! The lock feature comes in handy for different lengths as compared to others. iPhone camera with remote comes in handy. Bluetooth easily found and working in seconds. Other attachments for Hero / Camera also a plus. Fits iPhone 3's/4's/5's & 6's -Also 6Plus (Expandable iPhone insert)
Really good product and has good instruction
Awesome
Works just like its supposed to.
"Good Product if you are just looking for depth and water temp, I was . It does work for fishing but I think a die-hard fisher would want one of the bigger models. Easy install."
It says its lifetime warranty but it doesn't work anymore it completely stopped charging anything like my phone an tablet
good for price
Excellent
I am happy....but much cheaper made than the last one I got.
This has been such a life saver! I've already bought two. Would recommend this to anyone looking for a screen protector.
great price i have had this before but not at this good a value
It is really nice and its more convenvet
"Nice. Good quality look and feel. Lighter than expected. Charged 3000mah note 5 from 20% to 100% in under 2 hours, with light Web browsing for some of that time. After that, the charger still shows 2 of 4 LEDs on the meter.<br /><br />So far, couldn't expect more.<br />As long as it proves durable over time, great product."
"Great screen protector from a great company. Invisi Shell's customer service is one of the best I've encountered. The screen protector itself is very easy to apply--instructions and everything you need for a successful application is provided. One small flaw I would comment on is the cutting of the protector, as it is not perfect (no matter how much I've tried to align with the phone screen, there is a tiny part of my phone screen that still sticks out). But it rarely ever bothers me, because it's such a small difference. What I love the most about this Invisi Shell screen protector is that I don't even notice that it's there. The screen is so clear, and it is so responsive to the touch. Everything considered, I don't think I will ever be purchasing screen protectors from another company. Thank you, Invisi Shell!"
"Works great, the kids love rocking out in my car. This way I can pass my phone around for them to pick songs instead of it being tethered by aux cable.<br /><br />Start car, press button, start music, it's that easy."
"I had to really consider purchasing a used iphone, but after a lot of research, this one seemed the best for the price and condition. I have had no real problems with it and now I don't even think about it being used.  In fact, I love it!  The one time I had to call the company I purchased it from, they were very responsive."
Works perfectly with my M9 phone. I was able to get my phone fix!
better picture then OEM cameras in friends high end car
I haven't even had it that long and the white paint is already chipping off the whole case.
"I suffer from dying electronics quite often. I use this as a backup in case I need it. It's saved me quite a bit of hassle keeping my Samsung tablet from dying  (if you own an andriod, you know the battery life goes quick). The size is small, but it holds a lot of charge. It can charge my tablet to 100% while using it. I'm sure it has plenty of juice left to charge my phone (also an android, but never use it) since it charges quick and is very small, I can take it to concerts to save my camera from losing charge... its a high quality product and built well. green is my favorite color too so the Bytech battery pack wins! I received this at a promotional price in exchange for an honest review"
It is No new battery. Used. See metal connect.
"After two weeks, the battery is no longer recognized by my phone (no error message just does not recognize). Boo-hiss. Very disappointing."
I love it.  It was very easy to properly and securely apply it to my phone and sends to have improved the ease of use even.  It works great!  I am giving this honest and unbiased opinion in rewritten for having recurrences this product to try.
Just received my  case about a week or so ago and seems  very sturdy.  No problems so far.
"If you have no use for the dual point connectivity, DEFINITELY go with the cheaper model of the same brand! (Kinivo BTC450).<br /><br />The multipoint connectivity of this 455 model allows you to connect two Bluetooth devices concurrently. But it comes with some pretty major trade-offs. For one, for the first 30 seconds after turning on your car and playing music (through your phone for instance) the Kinivo is actively searching for a second device... and for those 30 seconds it fades in and out of your signal. So incredibly annoying!<br /><br />The second side effect is that it gets super confusing when a second device is synced simultaneously anyways. It's gotten so frustrating with my wife in the car with her iPhone paired as well. We have no idea what the Bluetooth is doing, cause sometimes my phone works, and other times hers does. Random. I reset the Kinivo and now I am the only paired device.<br /><br />I do like having a Bluetooth-enabled vehicle now, and everything else about the Kinivo I'm a fan of.<br /><br />One last thing is that if you encounter interference using this you may need what's called a Ground Loop Isolator. I purchased this one (https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001EAQTRI) and all my interference went away."
item as described and arrive on time
Works well
"HAD TO CUT IT TO MAKE IT FIT I PAD AIR AND COMES OFF WHEN I PUT CHILDPROOF CASE ON IT,BUT CANT BEAT THE PRICE"
"I've got an 10 year old truck and I listen to podcast. So I needed a way to listen while driving without the use of headphones. I've always had good experiences with Jabra and I can count this as one of them. Its also great for making and taking phone calls, I just have it clipped to my visor.<br />The only negatives and why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the volume were a little louder. You won't be able to use this if you have your windows open.<br />Also keep in mind that if you have to use your visor in the down position, the unit will be between your windshield and your visor unless you figure out a different mount. The clip is pretty sturdy, enough so that it isn't that easy to just unclip and reclip on the inside of the visor. it almost requires 2 hands."
"Fits snug, looks good. I would suggest getting the black case with the black edition and the silver case with the white edition, but that's just preference in my opinion.<br />Pros: easy to install, stylish, protection from light drops, and not easily damaged. Also allows clearance for camera and front screen when set on table<br />Cons: none that I have experienced yet"
"Nice phone.Amazing long life battery and sweet custom os color, white and orange, looks cool.<br />It's will be 5 starts if Blu developer team update phone to Lollipop as they promise in june."
"These came in the mail today. I tested them by switching out my current headphones with these ones during a conversation with my friend. He said that I sounded further away or like I was really small. So I tried out the second set. He reported the same issue. When I put my current headset back on he said &#34;he could hear me loud and clear.&#34; I've purchased a 2 pack set before, which was equally inexpensive, and was actually the set he could hear me &#34;loud and clear&#34; on. I guess this purchase was from a different seller. The packaging on this set was not the same as my original Samsung headphones were packaged or the last set I purchased. There were no additional earbud sizes and the cord is smaller."
Got it yesterday & think it's pretty good
very good product at a great price
"I used this Ram Mount yesterday for the first time. It works really well in the car. I drove on a washboarded dirt road and despite the high vibration, the phone stayed in its place. Also, the mount will work with a variety of phones which is nice. Good versatile design that works."
Excellent product! A+++++++++++
thanks
"Bought four of these cords they look and feel indestructible and have real nice plugs now I'm down to one they last about a week and wasn't handled rough and act as if there shorted out, dissatisfied they usually have a fantastic product I hope this is a one time thing cuz I know how to go somewhere else"
This is a good product. My only concern is that I won't be ale to use it when I need to turn on the heater in my car because I'm afraid that the hot air coming out of the vent will damage my phone.
it broker after 2 month
Bad case. The case kept coming out for no reason. And I  can't return it according to the seller. Waste of my money.
The whole system works great on my motorcycle for gps and stuff. I am on my second one because the rubber cracked and dried out on my first one.
"GOOD: Really good quality rubber on the inside lining and good non-slip hard outer cover. Last case I had my phone slipped in every surface, luckily this one is sticky enough but not too bad for pockets and very slim. Although, if wearing slim or skinny pants, you will prefer taking the phone without a case, with normal pants I can't feel it there.<br /><br />BAD: The only drawbacks are the lettering on the side &#34;Lightning Knight&#34; sounds like a 8-year-old wrote it, and the top and bottom sides where the ports are do not  have the hard shell protection, only the flexible rubber protects it from a straight-down fall. The hard shell does cover the sides and all the back of the phone."
I love this wireless charger i use this one daily and never have any issues with it i bought several other wireless chargers and all broke within 6 months or less i have this one almost a year now and it is great it has three coils and finding the &#34;sweat spot&#34; is just a think of the past this one you can just drop your phone and keep it moving I find the blue light on the unit to nt be distracting when I sleep at all great for a night table.
The cord works. Delivered on time.
"Left Speaker was Buzzy at loud volume, and Buttons failed first day, Returned after less than an 2 hours use... Very Bad Build Quality on a decent design..."
"This is a great case. Within two days of putting it on my phone I dropped my phone on the steps leading up to our deck. It bounced down the steps and landed on a landscaping stone we used in our walkway. My heart went to my gut as I just knew it was going to be a crushed mess. When I picked up my phone, it was perfect! No scratches, dents, and the faceglass was fine! This is a good phone case. I'm not going to say it will protect every phone, but it protected mine!<br />*I received this case for a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased and honest review. All opinions are my own."
Really nice
I scratch and break my phone all the time so this is great for me! I received a discount on my order for a fair review.
Works fine...
Works great!
Particularly like my green kettle!
Thought it was for the Vista
My father in law loves it! Thank you! A+++++++!!!!!
"Excellent product, sturdy and well made. Would buy again or recommend to friends."
Do not buy this item.  Thin layer and does not look like anything the ad represents.  Ripped off  And the seller owes me a new phone because the hammer test is clearly draud
Holster is not the same in the picture but still awesome!
"It does work well with my iPhone 5c, however, because of the phone protector I have, the cord that came with it will not fit into my phone.  But I can use the cord that came with the phone and it works fine."
"[[VIDEOID:b7d131804a5e4e6b5b74a31bbe162e3]] For the money, this dash cam is fairly decent. What I like about it is the compact size and high quality HD video. Check out the video posted with this review for actual footage taken with this cam. I was getting my car worked on at the auto shop, and it didn't occur to me until afterward that keeping tabs on what mechanics are doing with my car is a great application for this cam. I was watching the footage and wondering... when did I speed down the road like that, then run a stop sign while pulling a U-Turn??? Nope, my memory wasn't failing me, it was actually that dang mechanic driving my car like a jerk. So needless to say, I'm loving the auto record feature on this thing. I like that I can set how many minutes each clip should be, from 1 - 5 minutes each. The cam just keeps recording in these pre-measured increments, while continually deleting the oldest files. So the no-brainer, fully automated functionality is truly a bonus.<br /><br />Now for the stuff I don't like....<br /><br />The camera has a locking mechanism that attaches it to the suction cup windshield mount, aaaaand it really sucks. Every time I touch the cam to use any onscreen functions, or make a minor angle adjustment to the cam itself, it pops off of the base entirely. The suction cup sticks just fine, but the cam just falls off the mount waaaay too easily. The next quibble, is the user manual is terribly written. There's lots of sentence errors and jumbled words and confusion that just obfuscates more than it illuminates. The thing needs a serious rewrite, plus, some of the features aren't even mentioned, so I have no clue what some of it even does. Such as, parking monitor... um, okay, what's that? No clue. Sure, I could investigate, but why not just tell me outright?<br /><br />One saving grace, is the cigarette lighter power cable is nice and long. I was easily able to run a wired connection from my windshield mount, all the way to my center console where it plugs into. Cool. Then, after thoroughly testing it, I decided to pull the whole thing out in favor of a better dash cam that will be going up front instead. This one uses a mini USB connection, while the other uses a micro USB, hence the whole wiring had to come out. This one may get relegated to the back window; not sure yet. Oh, it's also worth mentioning that even though the screen is square, the video is indeed 16x9. The added screen space is for icons and onscreen feedback, which is actually a nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good economy dash cam, but there's better to be had.  I was given this free in exchange for an honest review.Cool. Then, after thoroughly testing it, I decided to pull the whole thing out in favor of a better dash cam that will be going up front instead. This one uses a mini USB connection, while the other uses a micro USB, hence the whole wiring had to come out. This one may get relegated to the back window; not sure yet. Oh, it's also worth mentioning that even though the screen is square, the video is indeed 16x9. The added screen space is for icons and onscreen feedback, which is actually a nice touch.    Overall, this is a good economy dash cam, but there's better to be had.  I was given this free in exchange for an honest review."
"The protective sheet did not separate on two of the three screen protectors.  The one that did separate was applied to cell phone, but it had little bubbles all over it that we could not remove.  Looked terrible.  We are trying a different manufacturer."
All you hear is static does not come out clear
"This case gives the Note 3 the sleek and stylish design that most people bought the phone for, but won't offer as protection that is as good as other cases such as Otterbox's. If you are really worried about the safety of this really expensive phone, you should consider more durable cases.[[ASIN:B00F9VRNJ6 OtterBox Defender Series Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3 - Retail Packaging - Black]]"
Arrived quicky and works as stated. Very happy with the screen protector
"Yes, I received it.  Thanks"
"Great phone case, it fits nice and snug, true to its words, waterproof shock proof. My only problem is that it seems to be not tough enough for a Marine. I dropped it so many times the from cover is falling off the stand broke off and a corner of the case broke off, still sick and water proof but unsure if I want to test it, I bought another one because I am sure the next one is to last longer. Great case for a great price, just not intense work environment"
Great product! Easy to install too
OK
"Nice product and price! Wish it came with just a few more small lanyards and less of the big ones. The small lanyards are made of a nicer, sportier, more attractive material. The large ones are flimsier and less attractive. But I am still giving this a high rating because the colors are nice, the quality is good, and the price was reasonable. I am using the big ones for my flash drives, and the 2 small ones I received will be for electronic devices."
This is a very nice quality charger.  It works great and looks good doing it.
"I have had no issues with this watch, unless it searches for the satellite signal a little too long for my patience, but it never lets me down! Also love the app and how it syncs with my phone."
its pretty good iphone 4. it runs a little slow but i found out thats how iphones work
loved it<br />no problems here
Great little walkie talkies for the prrice. It will go through batteries pretty fast.
"Protected my phone like it should, but i was disappoited it broke when i took it off (too bulky for everyday use)"
I received this and was very excited about having the wireless charger but when I received it I charged it up and I have 2 HTC and Motorola phones I tried both of the HTC and it would not charge them and neither the motto.  I was very upset.  The description of the phones that it would work on was the HTC and this is why I wanted it.  It will not charge either one of mine. I took this to work and a coworker tried and this is a great little charger if it is compatible with your phone.  make sure you read the fine print to make sure it will work..So i have changed my original rating and she is very happy.
"Item arrived as promised and in great condition.  This item works wonderfully, very pleased with purchase.  I would purchase other items from this seller."
"Hubby and I purchased these to help get us focused on becoming more active.  We were disappointed to discover they do not communicate with Hubbies blackberry or even our samsung tablets, but my S5 works great with them.  Downfall of that is Hubby has to wait until he is home from work to enter all his food and see his progress.<br /><br />I do like that we have a team of others using Jawbone, so we are able to encourage each other and hold each other accountable when we stop following our activity goals.<br /><br />We all had a hiccup this past weekend when the server didn't appear to be tracking properly.  According to my Up I didn't take a single step until 2 pm, but I was up and walking by 10 am that day on a beautiful winery tour.  Our whole team had similar issues that day.<br /><br />Otherwise, neat little product."
thumb up
"Can't go wrong with an OEM charger.  In this case, I purchased it as a spare charger for my new Samsung S5"
"This is great, even fits my I-phone with it's bulky protection case"
They didn't work
I thought it was a great purchase it look and felt nice with the soft leather. .. BUT within a week it started to peel off. Not worth it!!!
works great and my kids love it!
It keep sticking
Not happy with case or company it came from. Case did not  cover phone for good coverage. And it took me 6 emails to get my refund back. Will not order again
Gorilla glass screen protectors are so amazing. This isn't the first one I've bought and it won't be the last. They protect so well even from drops. The first time I dropped my phone with a glass screen protector I was scared my screen was cracked too under the protector. I pulled it off with relief seeing how perfectly it protected my screen. I will never use a different protector again! I recommend these to everyone and amazon is the best place to buy one. It came fast and well protected. This is a perfect fit.  I received this at a discount for my honest review.
Nice that it doubles as a wallet.
Nice quality and comfort.?The link removal tool worked perfectly and I had it adjusted in minutes.
Should have paid attention to the poor reviews. The cable works. Elsewhere. The iPhone 6 rejected the charger. I bought an Apple charger instead. Apple is more proprietary than Microsoft ever thought of being back in the old days when Apple was complaining about it.
works great
"Works great, certainly better than the 3rd party brand of previous one"
"After a short-lived MPOW, I tried this device.  So far, so good.  The sound is clear and the device is easy to control.  I also like how the ear piece turns in on this vs out on the MPOW.  The battery life is not as good as advertized or as good as the much bigger battery area would suggest, but I get enough time to drive to work, lunch, drive home and a little time in the evening so good enough for me.  The main drawback in my mind is the microphone boom.  While it's nice that it is small and can be folded back, why can't these guys make one that is just for listening without all that speaker nonsense.  I'd really rather be (or at least look like) an audio-only device."
The product did what I wanted it to.  No problems.
"I was a little worried about the installation of the glass screen protector, this is my first one.<br />Actually seemed quite a bit easier than the plastic ones I'm used to installing<br />and it feels phenomenal to the touch, so much better than plastic."
Love it!!!! It's great!!!!...would recommend it...💗
So reasonably priced and is protecting my phone better than a screen protector I paid four time more for!
"Plugged right in, don't believe all the one star comments"
Easy to put on.
"I was looking for something that I could easily carry that would give me definitive control and allow for using my finger print capability of my iPad Air 2.  I had read some reviews on other products similar to this and found that it was not unusual for the rotating fame to  chafe the back of the iPad leaving a ring on the back of the iPad but this product provided sufficient clearance while allowing for 360 degrees of rotation.  the only thing that was not perfect to me is the strap on the back where you put your hand.  It i velcro but does not provide for an aesthetic presentation.  It has a retractable stand on the back that is quite nice allowing for set up of the iPad when I set it down and want to monitor the iPad, this functions perfectly.  Although I would redesign the hand strap,I would buy this again."
Fits my Ipod perfectly and I will buy from seller again in the future
I got this watch for my wife's birthday and she is an avid exerciser.  She does not go a day without telling me &#34;I love my watch!!&#34;. As she springs to her feet because the watch reminds her she has reached her standing goal.
Great cord lightning fast charging!
Sticks great and moves well with my phone. I keep it up on my windsheild and it doesn't budge while I drive!!
Didn't work that well
"Good afternoon the products have not reached this far, although I have written have not answered"
Works very well.
"When I bought the phone, I loved the leather curve to it. But qucikly found I needed a case for it.  But this particular model with the curve is almost impossible to find a case that works and looks good without being bulky and difficult.  This works perfect and is very slim looking"
"I Love The Case, It Came Like A Week Earlier So That Was Great"
sound is very good. this is a great deal for the price.
The phone remains slim unlike other cases. It comes off easily when needed to replace the phone battery. Great case!
terrible 1st of all i paid for 2 day shipping and got my package in a week that not 2 day shipping and 2nd the f@$king battery was not even compatible and i made sure i read that it was compatible with my model iphone 5c don't waste your money on this crap!
worked well
Very good product for a reasonable price. Very easy to install and does an excellent job.
"Love it, love it,  love it!<br />Does everything i wanted it to do. .."
"Looks awesome with the gold iPhone!! I love it but the tops not covered, so i got a scuff on my phone."
Very quit speakers
Arrived on time.  As expected.  Thank you.
"Earphones only lasted a week before the cord started to fray and the wires become exposed.  Before that they were staticky and lost sound in one ear if I moved the device at all.  Unbelievable.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Waiting for a replacement pair of DECENT earphones now, will never buy these again."
"As far as the iPhone goes I like it. As far as this particular one, the screen is sometimes unresponsive requiring a restart. Not cool.<br /><br />update. downgrading to one star. it quit on me last night. it is still on, but the screen wont come on. am having to return it and I cant even wipe it before i do. not cool."
"Works great, super convenient all for a cheap price! Just wish I would have gotten black color instead of tan as tan shows the dirt."
Dropped my phone from the attic door about 15 ft and it was fine! Thanks Cell Bee!
Love it fits perfectly protects phone the best case
"These headphones has the latest bluetooth 4 technology and comfortable in ear design with interchangeable earbuds. Also these headphones works with iPhones, Android Smartphones, tablets, iPod touch, and other Bluetooth devices.<br /><br />The package includes a pair of headphones, a USB charging cable 6 ear buds.<br /><br />I was amazed that these headphones has a small button called multi-functional button. It also has a HD voice micro phone that you can talk through, and volume + and - button which you can use it to skip songs. There are more functions that you can't even imagine them."
Awesome case. Very protective case without being bulky.
better to replace this then the phone screen. Yes will not go to the edges but covers the parts you need it to and is easy to put on.
very disappointing when a &#34;factory unlocked&#34; phone won't work with verizon. how can they get away with saying factory unlocked when in fact it is not?
I love it!!!! Soo smooth
Awesome product just as promised and beyond quick shipping!
"didn't work, bad buy."
Impressed. Good quality and duarability.
"Poor quality. It looks cheap, and it is. Also, it does not have a magnetic lock. I didn't realize it before I bought it."
Muy buen producto
"I received this product at a discount in return for an unbiased review of the product. I was so excited to receive this speaker, I alway enjoy listening to music while in the shower, but it's hard to hear when the speaker is outside the shower. And the shower radio I had does always pick up well. With the Bluetooth shower speaker you can listen to what you want to listen to. And with the speaker being in the shower you do not have to turn it up so loud everyone in the house has to listen to it. I also used this in my hot tub, we could listen to music without the fear of getting our phones wet and it worked amazingly. The sound is awesome too, to be a small speaker it has a great sound. I was very impressed with this product. I highly recommend it!"
"Great case.  Just wished the glitter moved more, but it is beautiful. Would highly recommend."
"Love this wallet - fits my iPhone 6 in OtterBox Defender case. With my phone, I can't overstuff with coins or other things but the phone fits -- its snug but doesn't seem to pull the zipper when closed. Very attractive look.  I bought the blue and it is more navy than the picture in the description shows.  But the stitching and zipper are sturdy - time will tell since I just bought it."
I had this same case in gray...bought a bigger phone and had to buy this case. I love that it holds my credit card and ID so that I don't have to carry my purse everywhere. It's not bulky and I don't have to open a flap or anything. I love it!
The plastic case frame cracks and breaks easily. I just got mine and used it for a week. I dropped my phone on the carpet and the whole frame cracked and chipped.
Great
"I used the item once. While on my first ride, I hit a bunch going 16mph and one of the arms holding the phone popped off.  Because I was in a huge pack I couldn't go back and get it so after one use I am left with a dysfunctional mount holder.  I will also say that I continually had to re-adjust the phone due to any light road bumps causing it to move in a different position.  I would not recommend this brand. I don't know if a more expensive one will be better."
"I am a mom, always on the go. It is sad to say, but before this, I had never owned a car charger and always wanted to get one. I was happy when I got to try this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.<br />After getting my package, which I must say came very fast. I opened it up and didn’t need any directions because it is super easy to use.<br />I would recommend this product for everyone, but if you are someone always on the go and need to charge your devices. This would really save you in an emergency and everyone should always have one on them.<br /><br />Pro’s<br />Easy to use<br />Great price<br />Great quality<br />Fits most cell phones and other devices<br />Cool colors"
Perfect
Holds both wires perfect. Bolts to the battery with no modified
"The second day I had it on, I already got compliments about it. People didn't know what kind of Applewatch I had, because it was rose gold. It is a nice rose gold, stays on really tight. It's still flexible so you can press both of the side buttons easily, but I do not fear it coming off of my watch."
"Nice size and does charge, just not my Samsung S"
For the cost you can't beat these. The earphones came on time and have very good performance both in volume and quality. Unlike the standard Iphone earbuds they stay in your ears!
dont waist your money ! does not work 😂
Fits perfectly
"[[VIDEOID:c06d54005ac3a75238af74d8c87477]]I bought this cell phone case Iphone 6 by Collen for my sister because she needed a case that is not too girly. There were many colors to choose from but decided to get the yellow and black. When it arrived, I was surprised at how now nice the case looks. I bought the yellow and black. There are actually two parts for this case. The yellow part is a very bright color which is made from flexible silicone and the black part is removal which is a stand and is made out of plastic.One thing I like about this product is that there is a glass screen protector included with this case. Instead of buying a separate screen protector this you get everything you need in this product. The stand is pretty sturdy, very useful for when watching a video. I had the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price in exchange for my own honest opinion and I am glad I did."
Excellent charger.  Fast.
Quick and easy to install!
"This is lightning fast! I love the swivel head on the charger as well. Fast charger, fast shipping! Definitely recommend."
I used it until the new Grinch cover came in. Will start to use it after the first of the year. Well made and good protection for your phone
"The blue is not blue it looks more purple, but it's a pretty good case"
works and seems of a decent quality.  time will tell.
"Great product!  Clear, undistorted sound quality when streaming music from a tablet."
This was advertised to operate with a Doro 410 phone. The plug does not fit. Also the picture shown here is not what I ordered or received.
Would like a refund
It's really prettier in person. .great quality
Great phone... I paid 700$ for the samsung S5 and since the start I never got reception anywhere....I could hear the caller but the caller couldnt hear me.. I went thru this for a whole year... Everyone said it was TMobile...  I told them I always had 2 tmobile and when I used to have many blackberry's I can hear them always... So I waited till the Leap came out and bought it and it works great.... Signal is great anywhere I am... No more problems with callers hearing me... The home screen sometimes freezes so I have to hit the button to black out and then hit it again to get back to the screen.... Always loved BB and will continue... And it was below half the price of the samsung S5 that never worked!
Does not work with a larger Otter Box case on an iPhone 6. But the Amazon Basics car charger I bought at the same time does work. Seems like a real lack of thought from the designers.
"Works great for overnight charging, as it doesn't charge as fast as a plug in connection."
I'm over whelm with joy! It's just what I needed for my iPod! Thank you very much for providing me with it!
"Ever since I had my first iPhone I have used Tech Armor screen protectors. The glass screen protector works very well, protects against scratches and dropping. I have never had an issue with their protectors."
Way too heavy to carry around! But a necessity for android phone
"Wrong screwdrivers, we need a T1. No point in ordering this package."
Very handy
"Great case for the money.  Being clumsy I've already dropped it a few times, but no damage done. Looks really nice on the Gold 6 Plus."
So far good . if its fails after 4-5 month will let you know my dear .
perfect fit
"Bought it for an apple iPhone. for Virgin Mobile. Did not work, it was so frustrating that Virgin sent me a free sim card. Very bad experience."
I like this headset and use it regularly.  They connect easily with my phone and sound good (not great)  They are fairly comfortable to wear for long periods.  Good value for the money.
Great deal
So happy to have a charger for my car! It works great with my 5C and iPad.
Fast delivery.  Easy to apply!
Great case for my oversized HTC ONE Max! Keeps phone safe and dry - took to ball game and stayed nice and dry through the rain!
"This unit changed the focus of the camera, the picture is not as sharp as the original lens cover."
wrong this doesn't fit and itz not right.
"Purchased this to replace old AM/FM radio.  The Mfine AM tuner is worse than my current one, which is why I needed a new one in the first place.  Went to all locations in the house, upstairs and downstairs, would get static when dialed into a station.  Must be getting electric feedback from other devices in the house.  Returned the product and get a full refund.  On the lookout for another AM/FM radio to try, will try one with an analog tuner to see if any better than this one."
I use this while out on my kayak and it works great for my phone.  I am able to take pictures without the fear of my phone getting wet or falling in the lake.  Keeps my phone nice and dry.
Works great.
This is a great little case
nice product
"Very sturdy, plastic design. Not bulky. Very good charging speeds with my particular phone (Galaxy S4).<br /><br />Would highly recommend."
Perfect fit.  Looks great!  VERY pleased.
Very nice case
Great but the cord they gave for headphones sucks
It's not a original samsung if it was it would fit perfectly but it does not.I didn't have problems with the conectors.I had problems putting the phone back together.the bezel frame didn't go back together the way it should and not only that the the framework that the Screen and digitizer is attached is different.I had to modify it in some areas to get the speaker to fasten down due to a little nub that is sticking up that was not on my original.That is not all the dam thing gets real hot too.I can't send my back because I modified mine to Fit.
Kept our iPhones safe and dry kayaking and in the pool. Worked as intended during a sea kayaking trip. We spend a lot of time in and or around water this has been extremely useful. I also use it as a yard supervisor as I don't wear a watch and never have pockets so I can tell the time.
Screen came with the layers separating. Lots of ghosting. Had to replace in 1 day at local place due to failure.
"Have had this product for a few days now. It came on time and it plugs into my ihome perfectly. It charges my phone and let's me play music. Although my phone gave me a notification that the device was not recognized, it still works perfectly. I am satisfied with the item for the amount of money I paid (:"
nice little kit - can always use various size cables
Looks cool and works well
This is my second Anker battery purchase - bought one for my laptop too. Both work great. Happy customer!
Excellent product!!!
"The design of the edge to edge ballistic glass screen protector for iPhone 6 plus is pretty much garbage. The ONLY sticky part on the protector is on the actual active screen area. The other sections do NOT adhere to the screen, but instead FLOAT there. This means DUST gets stuck under it and blocks the camera and sensors on the front face. How ridiculous of a design! I wish I could get my money back for this garbage."
So far we like this watch however it did take some time trying to get it fully working with our phones
really like them have given a lot to friends
So far so good....
I bought this for my husband because he's a truck driver and this headset is exactly what he needed; in case of emergencies of course..
not what I thought it would be
OK
"well constructed, fits phone perfectly, very happy!"
"Does exactly what it should, and seems much better than the plastic film type.. worth it!"
good
Very fragile.
"I have purchased both these and the 6 inch version of the same cable.  I have had no bad cables and no problems with them.  the Magnet and holder help them fit nicely in a laptop bag.  I can grab the black, white, and grey cables and give the kids the colors.  I have them both in my laptop bag and in my car in the Texas heat all day and have had no failures.  I was a bit worried about the open design getting dirty and causing problems but have not experienced that yet.  Seems to be the perfect solution for the need for a bunch of cables around the house to charge various devices."
Dont buy it
Did wussy I needed it to do. Only wish it would protect the whole phone like a phone case
it works
This is meant for running and obviously you sweat in it. This sweat seeps in and not a good thing for your phone
All good
"***UPDATE 10.05.15*** Bought on 08.27.15, still working like brand new, great charger, fast and reliable. I don't know why I haven't bought sooner!  So far so good (1week in). I have my Bluetooth on, GPS, and Spotify on and this car charger gets ahead of the drainage. Like some chargers will either lose charge or just slowly hold that charge but never get ahead, this one works. I haven't used all four USBs at the same time yet, with my both my daughter's hungry tablets and the wife's iphone, but I will update when that's tested. But for right now, I'm never out of battery anymore while I'm traveling, which is great!"
does not stay on and is cheaply made
"As advertised! works great, cant beat the price!!!"
"This thing JUST WORKS!  As advertised, no issues.  You take a hit on audio quality switching to BlueTooth as opposed to a wired aux jack, but it's very convenient.  A couple things they don't tell you in the information for this is that it was easy for me to route my phone audio to my car's existing BlueTooth phone equipment and route my music audio to this at the same time.  Also, you can charge it while using it.  It says the battery lasts 10 hours on a full charge (and it takes less than 1.5 hours to charge it completely) but I have definitely used it for more than 10 hours on the same charge and decided to try charging while I drove for a day.  It managed to charge completely while being used.  That's a great feature!"
Crap...cheaply made....had scratches on it and it only cobers the back and sides.  Provides no protection for the screen like a case is suppose to do.  In fact it is not a case just a shell.  Do not buy!
"Love this product but it stopped charging after a month. By the time i had a chance to return it the time had expired. The company still honored our return and sent one without us sending the broken one back yet. I love the size of this product verses different shapes. This works best with my iPhone due to them being about the same size.<br /><br />I would recommend this company to anyone and will be giving these as Christmas gifts.<br />Thanks PowerAdd,<br />Joe Beniche"
Sexy case that hug the phone snug. Does not take the appeal of the device away.
good cable.
It is not a fast charger at all! I can get about 10% an hour. While my other charger can go from 0% to 100% in just over an hour.
Terrible. Won't pertact your phone at all. Waste of money.
relley good
Best case ever
"Zerolemon continues to release great, economical products. In the pack are 3 screen protectors, individually packaged with a small squeegee and micro fiber cloth. Installation is very simple and straight forward. I had to lift my protector the while applying as a small dust particle was on the screen. I lifted the protector with a piece of tape and used another doubled over piece of tape to remove the particle.<br />The fit is great and covers the full face of the phone nicely. These protectors are a bit thinner than the glass shields and my clear phone case fit just right.<br />I've had the protector on my phone for right and three weeks now and have had no issues with edges lifting or peeling up. The PET protectors are silky smooth and I think my responsiveness is much better than the glass shields.<br />I have had no issues with scratching or discoloration, or haloing. I typically clean my screen once or twice a day with the same spray cleaner I use for my eyeglasses and my protector still looks and functions good as new.<br />Another great Zerolemon product!"
"I really like these they are very comfortable to wear and have had absolutely no issues with them for the since I received them, Pairing them to my phone took seconds and  the controls were a bit awkward at first, but I think that was only because a similar pair I have are a bit different. The sound quality is not outstanding, but it is pretty good in my opinion.<br /><br />The charge on these lasted pretty long . I used them off and one for about three days before I needed to charge them. The range I noticed is about 20 feet, unless you are trying to catch signal between a door or walls It dropped on me when going to my third floor while the phone was on second floor. All in al they are not bad for the price."
👍Im very satisfied with my screen protector. It was easy to put on. Now my boyfriend wants one for his phone. 👍
So far I really like this case for the money.  I actually dropped my phone and the case did protect it.
This case does not allow one to listen to headphones while it is clipped to your belt. you have to leave the flap open. I do not recommend.
Excelente
Excellent value and provides a lot of protection for the phone.
Beautiful case that showcases my iPhone 6 very well. I thought it would be harder to get it on because of previous reviews but it really wasn't that bad. The video attached to the case wasn't very helpful though. It was for a different supcase. Great product!
Great !! working without major problems !!
like perfect fit
"I bought this to use for the connection between my iPad Mini 2 and my Phantom 3 Professional. This cable is a perfect solution. It is just the right length. Short enough that there is no extra cord dangling around, but long enough to be able to easily connect with a sunshade on the iPad. I bought a different short cable. It created HORRIBLE pixelation of the FPV. This cable provides FPV just as perfect as the way too long Apple cable . This is definitely a must have addition for the P3. Stop looking and buy it."
Works great.
"If you have a GoPro and any accessories you NEED a case to keep all of your stuff in the same place. From all of cases which I've seen and tried, this one is highly recommended."
"Great case, except I made the mistake of ordering one for an iPhone 6 instead of an iPhone 6 plus. All around a great case. Replaced my order for the correct case just now :)"
I like the service it's fast<br />And the products are awesome prices can't ask for less<br />It's the first time I buy from amazon<br />I love it
"I don't know if it's a defect with mine, or what.<br /><br />I received this ask week. Just opened it now. The lighting cable doesn't stay in the actual port.<br /><br />I have 4 cables. None stay plugged in. So rare third party, some are Apple certified.<br /><br />My car has a lighting cable port. Doesn't stay plugged in there either.<br /><br />Another downside.<br />When I turn the battery on. My service cuts out. From full, to no service. Kinda disappointed in this."
"This case surpassed my expectations. It feels sturdy, has a nice, easy to grip surface, and the magnet closure works well. The only flaw is that the phone holder seems a tiny bit loose on the right side, but that could just be because it's new and a little stiff. It holds the phone snugly, so I don't think that will be a problem. I recommend it."
This unit works PERFECTLY for my home stereo tied into my t.v. I get great sound quality and range. I have a huge master bedroom and never have a connectivity issue.
Love it good quality
"I don't know if this is the best case you can get, but it's got my view for the best bang for the buck.  This is my 2nd Jetech case (also had one for the Note 3) and I've been very satisfied with them.  I tried to save a few bucks by buying a no name import off eBay and it wasn't nearly as thick as and didn't fully protect the edges like the Jetech.  Won't stray again."
"This case is sturdy, easy to use, and provides good protection for the Samsung S6. It is at least equal to cases selling for over $40 in the phone stores."
LOVE IT !  THE GLASS IS VERY CLEAR AND YOUR PHONE STILL WORKS WITH NO PROBLEMS. I WILL DIFFANTLY BUY THIS AGAIN IF I EVER NEED ANOTHER ONE.
"Love this screen protector. I dropped my phone really hard the other day and I thought I cracked my screen, ended up just cracking the screen protector. It did it's job. I went out and got another one. Better to be safe then sorry!"
Perfect
Great product
"It works...for $25 that's all you can really expect.  First things first.  This is not nearly as user friendly as an ipod.  It, of course, doesn't sync to iTunes or any other music service.  What you have to do is convert any songs you have into mp3 and drag them into the device when connected to your computer.  If you have DRM protected music in your iTunes account, you're not going to be able to get it into this device.  Sound quality is very good (I can't tell the difference between this and an iPod).  The screen graphics are straight out of 1995 (again, it's $25).  Bottom line, though it works.  The battery life is decent and it meets my needs."
case fit perfectly.
It is not for BMW X5 2008
"Works very well for the intended use, i was actually a little surprised by the good quality of the sound, it's of course not a bose-like sound but it's pretty decent for a wireless headset. battery duration is very good, and overall no complains. I personally feel a little discomfort after wearing them for +45 minutes (at gym) since you really have to push them well inside your ears so that they stay in place. also the master and volume buttons are extremely difficult to use, i actually don't used them at all while wearing them (it's very hard to push), but i have no issues controlling everything from my phone."
"POSITIVE:<br />* Works well on Verizon.  The nano SIM from my Verizon iPhone 6 works perfectly with this Nexus 6.  I have the XT1103 version purchased from Amazon.  The product description incorrectly states that it doesn't work on Verizon.<br />* GPS navigation works well using Nokia HERE maps while offline (on airplane mode while location services is on).<br />* Quick charger works well and is fast.<br />* Vanilla Android.<br /><br />NEGATIVE:<br />* Curved back is comfortable for holding with one hand, but it makes it less stable in car phone carriers.<br />* Battery life is short.  Good thing the quick charger works well.  You should also get a good vehicle quick charger (e.g., Anker PowerDrive+ 1).<br />* Android is still not as smooth functioning as iOS. This is not Nexus 6 specific, but it's still worth noting."
My son appreciates the protection even though it took several tries to apply it properly.
Headphones work well. I use them for three hours every other day and the battery has lasted well.  They charge quickly.  Its been much easier to turn them on and off once I got the hang of turning them on and off with the left earphone in my ear so I could hear the alerts.
I've had this charger for around 7 months or so with no problems.
"This is a great power bank! Two USB outlets, charged it up once in the month ive had it, used it 3 times to full charge my phone and it still has 50% battery life left! You can turn it off while not using it to conserve power!"
Good Product.
Worked well. Simple an inexpensive.
Better than the smaller Sirius radio.
excelent cuality
"Works Like A Charm!! As soon as I received my Multi Port Charger, I started charging 5 Batter Packs.  I measured the Voltage and the Amperage of each port.  All were where they should be.  There was no drop between using just 1 port, and using 5 ports.  There was no abnormal heat buildup in the Charger, as I thought there might be.  If you have multiple devices that need charging, then this is a MUST HAVE for you."
"Received this product about 1 year ago and have been extremely satisfied with its performance up until 2 months ago when 2 of the ports failed. Probably caused by a wireless charger I had connected to these 2 ports. I called Anker Direct customer service and was told they would ship to me a new replacement product. No mess, no fuss. Very satisfied overall with both the product and Anker."
I admit it. I'm a phone dropper. I probably drop my phone at least 3 times a day and this case has yet to let damage happen to my phone. So if this case is able to stand the test of my tendecies then I guess it most be a pretty awesome case.
"Perfect case, looks just like the image. There are two card slots on the inside along with one cash slot. Fit my phone perfectly (:"
An iPhone 6 with an Apple case on it fits in the armband.
Met expectations
"I needed a case for  my oversized work issued LG Vista G cell.<br />Arrived less than a week after ordering.This is a good value and<br />PERFECT for my needs!The fabric body/metal clip combination makes<br /> all the difference.This case is rugged,solidly built and comfortable while<br /> clipped to my waistband on the job.I'd had an all plastic holster case for<br />a previous phone(Samsung Galaxy III mini ); that holster case<br /> was awkward to handle and uncomfortable on my person AND<br /> the plastic clip broke.<br />I highly recommend it for larger, hard to fit phones."
Do not like it very much.
This case has protected my phone from a few hard falls I love it. My only complaint an reason for 4 stars is the kick stand was very hard to open at first. I had to pry it open with a flathead screwdriver a few times to loosen it up.
"The quality of this case was extremely impressive!  I ended up getting two more different colors, was really surprised and will never purchase a case in the store again.... Thanks 😁"
Purchased  this charger after I got my iPad mini in June.  In July I used it on a 10 hr. road trip and along the way my iPad quit as charger wasn't working.  Tried it again today and found that sometimes it works and sometime it doesn't.  Could it because I have a 2009 European car?
es como se esperaba.
Love this! Charges all of our stuff
"I've had this case for a while now and it's a complete disappointment. What you start with is a too sticky case that grabs onto lots of stuff that you don't want it to stick too and then that stickiness completely goes away in a little bit, so you end up with an ordinary case worth $8 that you paid $50 for."
Easy to install. But about a week later my wife dropped the phone and the screen cracked. I did warn her that it was not gorilla glass. Wont bother replacing it again.
Its nice but too big
"Great product, easy to use, and gets rid of almost all cords. It's been a real life saver."
Super Sturdy! Very Happy with this purchase and we ordered more just to have a change.!
Item as described!
My oonly issue is where is the first package i ordered? Had to wait an extra 6 days and still im waiting on the case that goes with it. Package is cheap to say the least but its here and on my phone. And unlike other screen protectors this one is actually for my phone and not a universal one advertising as a direct fit.
bbbb
"AWESOME!!! I bought this case because it does NOT have a stupid magnetic clasp that erases all my credit cards! I am still using the one i bought in 2014, and I use my phone like its my job (well, its my work phone). The only reason I am thinking about purchasing a new one (same case) is because mine is just old and dirty. A+ in my book for holding up until it was old and dirty, not falling apart like other cases i've tried.&#60;3 Peace."
Love it! Got it on time and exactly as described
Perfect and cane really fast
Works fine. Havent had it long so will see how it holds up. I love the long cord. I use it on an older ipad i have.
"Very good, love it."
Better than the last tempered glass screen protector that I bought. This one didn't even crack upon installation!
Nice screen protector for the price I is posted at. Not even the slightest scratch so far.
"This is the ONE BEST accessory I have ever owner for my iPhone and LOVE IT. I would NEVER go without one, now that I have used it. It does EVERYTHING that is promised, easy to use, fits perfectly in a case brand I use (one size larger then previous), protects my phone, prevents me from hitting darn buttons by accident, looks and feels like a typical case...on and did I mention the BEST and MAIN reason I got it....I can go a whole day and sometimes still be at 100% reading on my Phone!!!! Prior, it would NEVER make it through a day with out a booster charge or two!! This device for your phone (for all compatible models) is a MUST HAVE ACCESSORY. I hate even to use the word accessory. It should ne a NESSISITY. I STRONLY recommend this to all that seek more (REALLY MORE) battery power, that will make a small fingerprint in size, real easy on the wallet and is built with high quality to last...and it still looks so good....make may phone look better with added protection! You can't go wrong. And this seller is fantastic!!! I will always but this one from this seller via Amazon!"
"It fits well and does what it's supposed to do. When I take the case off, the phone looks as new as the day I bought it. I would give it five stars if the clear case hadn't yellowed. Also, when debris does eventually work its way in between the case and the back of the phone, it wears permanent smudges into the inside of the case."
"This is exactly as it says - Clever!  Very simple to install and use, easy to follow directions.  Please note- you must have an auxiliary input to use this.<br /><br />From the time I opened the package, removed the contents and read the instructions to actually installing and using was under 10 minutes, most of my time was deciding the ideal place to mount it!<br /><br />After it was literally a minute until I was testing a hands free call to my wife.  She said the vocal was clear and by using the cars stereo system I of course had no effort hearing her.<br /><br />Pairing the device was simple and quick too.  Plus this has last device paired memory, which is convenient when taking your phone with you and returning back to your car.<br /><br />This is a great hands free kit!"
not as good as described.
Wao is excelent i am writing from the phone. Thanks for everything.
"i received this product free for review and it works great. it is very easy to put on my phone. and easy to open, once i put it on my phone it was pretty easy to see there were no bubbles or anything . it works great and fits perfectly"
Worked perfectly and auto detected all the steering wheel buttons. I would recommend flashing to the most recent firmware before installation.
This thing is amazing ! Covers my iPhone 6 plus easily but with out a case on my phone. Able to take pics and videos with this case on and hear my music perfectly when I bring it in the shower
"great product easy to use, fitted well"
Excellent Thank You..
"I purchased the same case for full price and it started breaking soon after, this is the same case and the price was spectacular"
perfect fit. i bought for my mom，its easy to use and really helpful.
"So I've had these for 5 months and find that they have some of the best battery life of my bluetooth headsets.  I mainly use them for audio books so cannot say the quality for music but the volume is good and clear.  I barely can use the for phone functionality though because of the poor mic.  I usually switch to handheld or say that I will call back if I cannot switch.<br /><br />I use these for 2 to 3 days listening off and on while doing chores, walking, sometimes driving (though I will pull one side off my ear to be able to hear outside better), etc..., before need to charge them.  This is hours of use, I can get through at least one book, which on average are 9-10 hours and then some.<br /><br />Little complaint- the blue light is too bright and quite distracting, especially inside and in darker rooms.<br /><br />Great headset, poor mic, great battery life"
The case is light and sturdy.  It is easy to wear on my belt and thus far I have had no problems.
So far the two we purchase have preformed well. Hope they continue to hold up😉 thx!
Works great and thank you for fast shipping
Love It! 💯
Works  great.
"PROS: Minimal and easy snap on protective case. Love the clear. iPhones are too good looking to cover up with a bulky, opaque case. The plastic is good quality and has some flexibility, so case buttons are easy and will not stick. I rely on this case and a protective tempered glass screen protector to breathe easy when I drop it. And I do drop it - and my phone stays safe and brand new looking! (I used this same case style and my last phone looked mint for years). CONS: Only 1. The case will slowly start to yellow over months, most noticeably around the 8th or 9th month in use. I like to replace the case every 5 months."
For a Birthday present and it was a hit
Great
"I bought this AC charger because it is UL listed.  A UL listing means that the design and manufacture both meet safety standards for protection against shock or fire.  If your adapter is not UL listed it could shock you or damage your phone/ipad/mp3 player.  A listed product has a UL file number printed on it. Verify the listing by looking it up on the UL website.  Listing by CSA, TUV, VDE, or ETL are just as good as UL.  Unfortunately, a CE mark means nothing as far as safety. BTW, this charger works great !"
Works great for my iPhone. What else can I say?
They work great and came on time
Slim. Convenient. Easy to use.
I've had a similar product before that lasted me over a year. This thing fell off within a day...
a great investment to protect a $300 Cell Phone
Never fit right
Arrived earlier than expected! Easy to assemble and looks great!
The wife loves it...that's all that's important
"Very satisfied. Fits snuggly, design in good condition, has not worn off."
Brilliant bit of kit especially as you can plug in your device while charging the power pack.
Very good.Works in my S5.
"I installed my car mount and so far so good! It tends to wobble and twist on a robust pothole or bump but that's a minor inconvenience that I'll get over but the grip itself is very good. I watched the how to video and it was self explanatory and very easy to install. I use it on my Galaxy Note 5 which has a case on it making it a bit thicker and it fits great! I like that I can either clip it to the vent or stick it to the windshield, it's very versatile and easy to switch out."
"Does its job. Nice looking, I like the stand. Can use the stand horizontal or vertical"
it is very good and i like it.
"here's a lot to like about this stand for Apple Watch. It's very modern and stylish. It's well-built. It's practical and convenient. It also holds an iPhone 6 or 6+, which I love very much. It slides together easily and looks great. I love it."
"Horrible quality.<br />It attracts dust inside the screen protector.<br />And don't know how but unintentionally it is getting broken on the sides, and today I took it from my pocket and I saw it is broken completely on the top left corner.<br />I spent $14.99 bucks on this product and it is not even working like a $0.99 worth product. Simply waste of money, tech armor deceives people projecting their stuff as quality but their quality is not even worth a penny.<br />I knew that I have one year warranty on this product, I will see if tech armor will replace the defective piece, otherwise I will write one more review mentioning the type of service I received from them."
"Excellent in every respect.  The case exceeded my expectations.  Compact, rugged, and secure.  It was delivered on time with a stylus and screen protector."
"Does not fit my phone, they did not specify that it would not fit active..."
Love my case! It meets all expectations. I've had it less than a week and have already been receiving compliments.
Works great
"Easy, fast,all is good."
Great product. Quick service.
I love my case...
i absolutely love this case. It shipped super fast and is exactly as pictured/described. Unlike other cases this one has 4 card slots which is what i was looking for. Mine also came with a screen protector and one of those watersafe ziplock bags that you can put your phone into if you are doing water sports like kayaking or paddle boarding. Overall great product
I like it!
My husband loves this case. Definitely a good purchase
"POWER POWER POWER! This sums it up, it provides all the power for my phones (Nexus 5 and OnePlus One). How much power?! 2.1 Amp PER USB PLUG! None of this BS 2.1 Amp if you use 1 plug crap... Nope we charge two devices at a full 2.1A ... Love this plug."
Works Great! Haven't found any issues with this product.
Very durable and super cute!
The look is quite impeccable however my only concern is that the back scratches quite easily. There are noticeable lines on the back that feel kinda annoying to the touch. The front is good and prevents the screen from making direct contact with the ground in case you drop it.
"shipping was fast. My daughter splashed my son with water and it was puddled up on top of the speaker, and it still works fine."
"So it does only give you privacy but with a high cost!!!<br />1) A privacy screen should stop people from seeing the screen, not me! I had to have full brightness on to see anything on my iPhone. this drains my battery much faster.<br />2) the screen protector pushes buttons on the screen.<br />3) it peels off quickly.<br /><br />Returning this right now!"
LOVE ITTTT
"I was going to buy these but noticed a lot of bad reviews with similar complaints.  Mostly that they are uncomfortable, slide off easily and are not water proof as advertised.  Thanks for the heads up!"
just as described
Great product
Broke the first time I used it.
I bought the wrong case but it looks very protective lol
Is great.  A little bulky but it has a lot of Juice.  I can charge my Galaxy S4 4 times full.
I love it and so doesn't my grandkids...
"I purchased an Anker battery to resolve my charging problem, but it did not.  After their customer service department sent me a new one for free it became clear it was an issue with my phone, not their battery. Anker was incredibly responsive to my initial complaint, even inquiring whether it had resolved my problem after they had sent me a replacement one.  Very impressed with their customer service, it is among the best..."
I love the mint green color. It's a nice case. Very protective.
"Cheap,the colors are faded and the white is more of a dingy yellow and the gold is just brown, it does not look like the picture at all. But it has a nice finish. Very thin, not worth the price its listed as."
"I love the design of this case, but that's about it. For one thing, it won't even stay on my phone, it keeps randomly popping out of place and it won't actually protect your phone at all, lots of the edges are still exposed."
Perfect
"I bought these to use while I cut my 5 acres of grass in Florida. They did not stay in my ear when I was sweaty and after trying them a couple of times, the right side no longer had sound. Very frustrated!!!"
"The iPod nano has gotten so tiny these days, I bought the arm band basically so I didn't drop the thing.  Good quality construction.  All I need in a band.  No complaints.  Came fast and free with Prime."
I love it! It is a beautiful case with the mint colored background and the roses of different shades of pink. The green leaves and the small white polka dots really pull the whole thing together. The fit is perfect and it seems well constructed. Very impressed!
I was able to reuse this about 4 times before it stopped holding a charge.
"I absolutely love this thing. It holds about 6 full charges for my phone at a time, so I charge it completely about once every two weeks. It's exactly what I needed, and saves me from having a dead phone."
I have not figured out why it falls off the dashboard while I drive. Perhaps someone out there knows?
"A great case, that's actually made to fit the Droid Turbo (Ballistic Nylon version).  Sleek, stylish and overall great design."
good product
easy to set up and works wonderful
The quick charge only worked once and then it became even slower than a regular charger and sometimes it would not even charge my phone all the way.
"My daughter bought this for me, about 2 weeks ago.  This is a really great way to keep track of your activity level, especially since I am now semi-retired.  It gives me an extra nudge to &#34;get up, and keep moving.&#34;  I'm actually enjoying it more than I thought I would."
Don't waste your money! It was supposed to come with 2 tempered glass covers and only came with one! The best part was the one it came with was waaaay too small and not cut for the 42mm Apple Watch. It didn't cover a large portion of the watch face. I hate when people sell stuff under a description that isn't true! This is one of those those items on AMAZON. Don't waste your hard earned money even its only a few bucks. This was a total waste of a few bucks!
"My daughter loves this case! It shipped fast, it's cute and is sturdy so it will protect her phone from normal teenage life. the price was outstanding considering how durable the case is!"
"Fits nicely in the vent of my VW Jetta. I wish it was angled to face the drive, it faces perfectly perpendicular to the car. Not the biggest of issues, but still a small annoyance. Overall solid design and feature, my phone never feels like it's going to fall or slip out. Price is on the higher end for what it is, but it's a nice thing to have for hands-free driving"
Great product
Arrived on time and perfect for my needs! Gr8 price!
"The cable broke, it is not as good as I expected"
I love it!
Works great and never falls out but anytime I move mty phone more than a few inches it cuts out for a second.
love it!
"All you could ask for!  I've owned a portable solar charger before but it was junk compared to this!  Lightweight and sturdy. A quality product! For the price you can't beat it! I do most of my travelling on a motorcycle, so not having a charger outlet becomes a hassle. This keeps my phone at 100% until I reach my destination. Customer service is also as good. Had a question regarding the product and received an answer within the hour. AWESOME PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE"
Works.  Good price.  What can one say?
"Received my mini selfie stick today. It was very well packaged and also came with a little velvet bag to store it in. I have a large LG Stylo and its kind of a tight squeeze to get it in the clasp but it will hold it. The stick stretches about 2 ft. Just enough to get a few more friends into that selfie!! Or like me, getting a selfie with a concert going on behind you! Great shots thanks to this little guy! I did recieve this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion. Overall its a great little selfie stick easy to carry in your pocket. Im definitely enjoying it!"
It's waterproof but the buttons don't work that enable you to take pictures.
"This is my second purchase of the enviCar phone holder because I left the last one in the rental car, oops.  So this time I bought two so if I loose one and can use the second until my next order arrives.  I use my phone holder all the time staying cool and never falling down.  Thank you for a great product."
Can't beat it best on the market so far I'm sure there's better out there but for the price it's definitely worth it the only thing I seen that goes wrong with it is the circular thing in the center that you have to press to activate
"this is silicone and not leather,  don't be confused.  Everything sticks to this,  lint,  money,  etc.  So you pull it out of your pocket and sometimes even the pocket lining comes out.  If you want it to be non-slip,  go for it."
You'll be very satisfied just like me!  (&#62;‿◠)✌
"My charger is not working, I was wondering how I could exchange it?"
didn't fit my phone at all. It said it fit my exact brand and model. It's huge and I don't have a glass cutter. I just tossed it
"It only work for 2 days, sent back and was able to receive my full return without any problems from the manufacturer"
hard to get charger that works great and good price.
great
Great product for the price. Keep one in my purse at all times. Works quickly and easily. Couldn't ask for more.
"I bought this stand for my boyfriend and he loves it! So much better than laying the watch down onto the charger. He loves it so much, I'm buying another one for me! The charger snaps into place easily and the stand seems sturdy enough not to tip over. Priced well."
It was really cute when it arrived.. But less than 30 days literally fell apart .. Not worth your time!
I love that this does not coil. Its easier to put away and doesn't spring you phone onto the floor.
"The holder is robust and keep my phone in place, also very easy to remove."
Good case
Fit the 5C perfect great case
"I really love this product... Somehow I always had problems with this type headphones, but this ones fit perfectly, sound is amazing, it does stay when you run..."
Took only a few flicks of the volume button for rubber to break. Also the white gets dirty very quick and it's hard to clean. The headphone port requires you to have a straight thin plug like the original headphones that come with the iPhone. Other wise it requires you to screw in an extra cord every time you want to use headphones. Works pretty well as a plain case if you don't mind the rubber breaking and it not being waterproof anymore but odds are if you are getting this product you want it for its waterproof capabilities.
"This came with a lifetime warranty and broke one day after the 30 day return time. I cannot find a way to return it either through Amazon or through Wildtek. I am highly disappointed in both companies.  After posting this review, Wildtek contacted me and honored the warranty. I appreciate the effort made by Wildtek and will recommend the company to other users. I"
Good price for a great items.
"Great product, dependable protection for your valuable electronics."
I love this case. It's perfect for carrying my iPhone and acts as a small purse! I definitely recommend.
"I've  owned Otterbox Defenders for all my family's phones but that have an Achilles heal in the fact the rubber material they use for the outer sleeve stretches after about 5 months of use and need's to be replaced. That in itself is unacceptable but now reduced their warranty because this problem was getting g to expensive  for them. My first one for my Note 4 us about 5 months old and I just had to file a warranty claim for a new outer slip cover. Experience has taught me I will be doing so in about another 5 months and after that (pardon me there is no easier way to put this) I'm screwed. Google the problem and you find thousands of owners all with the same stretching problem and apparently Otterbox doesn't care and this case carry a $69.00 MSRP that's  not chicken feed. Guess I'll  have to look at a Life Proof. More expensive for sure but wit the Otterbox Defender outer rubber slipcover only lasting 5 months before the corners stretch you'd only be entitled to two replacements before the warrant expires which translates into buying a new case from Otterbox every year, I don't think so."
A bit bulky (interfering with the view out the windshield) but works as promised.
Great product
Awesome product and great price.  Received quickly.  Will work with this vendor again.
it does not work with iphone...
My friend loves this little gift.
"I have had this pone for about two to three months now and I am very disappointed. The camera quality is terrible. The battery life is even worse. I find myself having to charge my phone a few times a day. Also, when I am texting the phone will close me out of my app for no reason. It'll close me out of my internet as well. All in all I'd give this phone a 0 out of 10. Don't waste your money on this."
Fit my Note 3 perfectly. Looks like the original to me (says Verizon on it).
I absolutely love this case.  Very girly but sophisticated.
It didn't fit right it was making my phone take a lot of photos 😡
"This product completely meets my needs. It provides protection for the back and corners, fits tightly, is very lightweight, provides a nice transparent casing to show off the iPad, and provides a firm grip when working on the iPad on one hand. It is ideal for In-home use, and if I need more protection for outside trips, I have a zipped case that this fits nicely into."
Instructions where wrong. Had to look up how to do it myself. Only worked for a week and now the remote won't even turn on. I've tried new batteries and making sure the connections weren't obstructed. Nothing works. Had to disarm my truck manually. Do not buy! Worse buy ever
"Great case, protects well, not impossible to remove, looks nice. Kickstand is a bit flimsy bug I never really use it anyways."
"I love this product!  I had the 1st version and passed it down to my wife.  Yes, the batteries last for a year!  For the new version, the addition of the back light, timer and strap lock make this the best fitness band on the market today.  For the price and features, I would recommend this over any other fitness band."
great product and fast service.  will recharge your phone in no time!
Very good. good seller.
A good solid cable.

"An easy to use mount.  Fits the handlebars well.  The safety cord that plugs into the earphone jack is a nice touch and has saved the phone from several plummets.  However, the ratcheting clip seems to be good for only half a year or so of near-daily riding before it starts to lose its grip on the phone."
"I love this product. It charges itself quickly and charges my phone faster than plugging it into the laptop or wall. The battery also lasts a long time for me. I traveled on and off the last month to 3 different locations and this definitely came in handy to charge my phone when I was out and about. It fit easily in my bag and has enough power to charge my phone through multiple charges. I was even able to offer my friends' phones some juice because of how well this held up. I highly recommend this product, it was worth the price for me!"
Clip broke off after two months ! Have to purchase another Case from a better Manufacture.
"Lost my first one.  Loved using as it provided an excellent charge option for trips. My teenagers borrowed it from me for the last year and lost it.  Bought two this time, one for the kids and one for myself.  Great price for this level of charge device"
wORKING FINE!  I AM HAPPY WITH IT.
Good
Great product works perfectly
"Excellent, great protect for the phone and looks elegant..."
This did not fit my iphone 5.  the phone pops out of the hard shell.  I wouldn't buy this again
"It's a soft matte case that helps protect the camera from touching the surface you're setting the phone on (which is the main reason I even have a case on the phone) without adding bulk. The cool benefit is the port covers which actually do a good job. The buttons so an amazing job at preserving the tactility of the buttons. The material is such that it has a bit of abrasiveness to keep it from flying off of surfaces but it shows the marks/scratches...all in all, it's not a bad case. For the price, if you're looking for a slim durable case...this is definitely a good choice.  -Edit- I bumped up my rating, initially I gave it 4 starts because of it showing the scratches/marks on the back, but it turns out that they disappear after a while...to be honest, I bought a TON of cases for this phone, and this is still my favorite."
Works perfectly on a wide range of antennas. Always get a good 1.5 SWR or lower.
"I purchased these headphones for my 2.75 year old for a airplane trip. The things I was looking for were: comfort, volume control, durability, connectivity to another pair (I also have a 5 year old). Lil Gadgets headphones fit the bill exactly. I read many reviews of headphones for children & was torn between cutesy character ones that I knew my kids would love and more simple designed ones like these. In all the reviews I read comfort & volume were big issues. I decided any headphones I purchased must have padding at the top so the kids could wear them without discomfort. The ability to connect the headphones without a splitter is genius. The simplicity of the design makes them a joy to use. I read other reviews of this product which people said the volume was too low and their kids could not use them on the airplane. I did NOT find this to be true at all. My kids could hear perfectly well, and we were even seated next to the wing. Overall my kids LOVE these headphones, had no problem wearing them for extended periods, the fact that they fold into themselves also makes travel easier and more compact, the kids were able to hear fine & are excited to use them on trips now. In the end the fact that they are simple, no crazy color or designs were a plus, they look just like my husbands so the kids feel very grown up when they use these. The cord is fantastic, it's like a shoelace material & I can tell they will last longer with this design. I also like the fact they each come with their own dust bag (makes it so much easier to travel and carry around) If you are looking for children's headphones, these are superior to any others you will find for this price point. I highly recommend these headphones for toddlers and young children!"
I got this charge for my desk and it works just like the one that came in the box with my phone. Plus it came with an extra cord.
"Worked perfectly, was delivered in a timely manner and the extra tools were appreciated."

BOUGHT THE FOR MY DAUGHTERS 14TH BIRTHDAY HUNDREDS CHEAPER THEN A BOSE AND EVERYONE IS HAPPY  I RECOMMEND IT!!
I purchased this for my sister for Christmas last year and she loved it so much that I bought it for my son this month.  He especially<br />likes the feature that is a split screen for inner city driving.  It tells you what lane to be and how long until you have to get off the<br />exit ramp.  It makes driving so much easier in heavy traffic when you never know when it is time to exit.  I also like the posted<br />speed limit feature that turns red when you are speeding. This also has lifetime updates on maps.  This is very important if you use<br />the unit often.  My son uses it daily and has thanked me repeatedly.  Great gift idea.  Best GPS on them market!
"Simple fast car charger. Works as intended. Can charge two iPhones rapidly at once, which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />5 stars."
"I purchased as a gift for my wife and she love it, my strategy was simple 1 apple watch with the sport band in apple store and many bands in amazon."
Did noot work
I wasn't sure about this at first but it has grown on me. It works really well and if you get the tv antenna and upgrade the GPS antenna this thing is worth every penny. I only wish that customer service understood english a little better but the product is great. Custoemr support is more than willing to assist and it's pretty easy to use.
"This product did not work in the least.  I have little cell reception and placed the outdoor box in a clear area on top of the roof, but it did not improve my signal."
works perfect
excellent product.  much more durable than the rubber/plastic units.
"Had for over a year.  Yesterday on I-94 in Detroit I was doing about 80 miles per hour and a bug feel on my phone.  I held the phone up to see if the wind would blow it off and the wind caught my phone with so much force that it went flying out the window at 80 miles per hour on the freeway.  My phone was not damaged but he case was a little scraped.  My wife told my in-laws that I usually pay a lot of money for a good case to protect me phone so she's not surprised.  :)<br /><br />I can't believe my screen wasn't cracked or anything after this thing bounced off the pavement or even another car at 80 MPH.  Attached are the photos.<br /><br />The screen got a little damaged, and Seido was great about replacing it.  I tested it in water and it didn't get any water in it.  Only complaint I had is that people have a hard time hearing me on speaker phone with the case on - so I have to hold my phone to my head or use a Bluetooth headset."
The highs are so crisp 👌🏼
Great case that holds a snug fit on s6+. Clear case to show off phones sexiness. 5 stars
WOW!!!!  It really holds super strong!!!  Very helpful
Great little case.
Good produt
Excellent
This does fit my JAX S1360 just fine. It is a pretty rich purple color not pink at all. The makers don't say it fits the JAX but it really does just fine. I snipped 1/8 of an inch off at the bottom front (notched cutout edge) so it would not overlap the bottom keys. Otherwise it works well and makes the phone much less slippery and much easier to handle. This phone is the one that Assurance Wireless customers get through state Lifeline plans.
Really saved my butt after I sliced the original.
"After having bought and used many different ear buds through the years, these are the best I've found for the money.<br />I've had one set for well over a year and they still work perfectly with great sound. I recently bought another set as a backup.<br />I highly recommend these at the under or near $10 price I paid."
I really like this case for my iphone 6 plus. It was received when stated. It is very convenient and stylish.
"Like previous post points out that the LTE on ATT is not working properly due to ATT network can't handle MTU 1500 setting properly.<br /><br />Good news is that it has been resolved by ATT and StraightTalk recently and the Z289L shall work fine now on LTE. Nothing need to be done by user or the device. I have tested this device in couple places at ATL, MIA, DFW and LTE works terrific!"
This is exactly what I need
Fast charges my Galaxy S6 just like the charger that came with the phone.
Fit as expected.
I love this case! The only reason I gave it a four star is cause trash easily gets under the screen protector and have to take it apart to get it out!! Fix please!!!
"Great fitting case, and clear enough to show the Lumia casing's brilliant color!"
Sound great and stay put! :-D
Leather doesn't hold up well.
so useful tiem and good price!
Chipped and broke in the bottom right corner after barely dropping my phone.
Worked at first. Tried it again and could not get it to work.
Had issues with charging and after 3 months the adapter to charge no longer works.
Great headphones. a little uncomfortable if worn for a long time.
I have used it for months and it still looks great
Love it
Works great thx
It looks soooo good on my phone. I get complements on it all of the time.
nice case
"Works fine, price was great.  Delivered on time."
"Im a clumsy adult whose constantly dropping and shattering screens but I've had this case for a little over a year and its still going strong. I've dropped it on just about any surface as possible, road, sidewalks,  tile, & even smashed it on my car door... love it & cute color too (:"
Did not work.
"Sound quality through the radio can't get any better. Distortion can occur, just remember to turn down the device volume and use the car's volume adjustment."
"Are you kidding me?!?!!! I couldn't pass this up!  I can charge, sync and use the cord for a kickstand to watch videos. Throw in the discount I got and call me one happy guy!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00SNVC416 LABC - Cable & Ultra Protection Case - Apple Certified MFi Lightning Cable in Case - iPhone 6]]"
"I was happy with the up but I truly love the up24 because it tracks my sleep, water and steps. It even allows me to sync with myfitness pal and other apps."
very high quality. bought two and third is on its way! Absolutely recommended!
"Great Wireless Charging Kit for my iPhone and SamsungS6<br /><br />I purchased this wireless charging kit to use for my iPhone 6 and Samsung S6.<br /><br />I have the iPhone 6 but my wife has a Samsung S6 phone, due to Samsung S6 is Qi enabled, so the qi pad fits her phone perfectly well. For my iPhone, there is an iPhone receiver kit in the box, I do not need to buy an extra one, it's really helpful.<br /><br />As soon as I place my iPhone 6 or Samsung S6 on the pad, the pad quickly to start working. Now I just need One charging pad and it’s enough for All our phones.<br /><br />Would recommend to anyone looking for a wireless charging solution for their iPhone 6 and All Qi-enable phones."
LOVE this speaker! The battery lasts forever and its actually pretty loud. It's very light weight and easy to store away when you are finished with it. I definitely recommend this speaker to other buyers!
"tremenda maquina,.,."
Functionality is great followed by a great design. Card slots are a little tight at first so they need to be broken in. Some stitching is a little weak but doesn't cause any problems. Highly recommended
Super! The size u need for iPhone 6!!!!
Doesn't work. Plugged in a light came on and then went out. Did not charge my phone. Junk
This was the easiest screen protector install I've ever done. The hinge technique is simple and intuitive. Definitely worth it.
I was looking for a protective case for my iPhone 6 for bike rides when it needed a little more protection against bumps than usual.  The phone fits perfectly in this case with its thin case (Belkin Grip Case / Cover for iPhone 6) still on.  It's also very easy to get in and out of the pouch.  Exactly what I wanted.
I wish it could fit a slim phone case so I didn't have to take my phone out every time I use it. Other than that I have no complaint.
"hold the charge, charger is a convenient touch.  I would recommend these batteries"
Nice phone... Cant get ahold of seller to see bout my return
My first impression of this case was that it was sleek and modern looking. However I had this case for less than 24 hours and when I took my phone out of my pocket the gold bumper was cracked in half. This case is not meant to protect a phone what-so-ever.
Fantastic! great purchase
"Very durable, works great."
"This is perfect for somebody with way too many electronic devices, just like me.  This is the way I use this: I drilled a hole in the back of the top drawer of my nightstand and threaded the power cord of this port to the power outlet in the wall and then the port hangs out in my nightstand drawer connected to my iPad, mobile phone, Kindle charger and fitbit charger.  I can store all of these ugly cords out of sight and let everything charge at once in my nightstand drawer every night.  I love it!"
For some reason  this samsung cable doesn't  work is the 3rd one i am order same problem
Really happy with product. Has substantial weight to it.
"This SIM card, SIMGLW206R, worked perfectly to activate a Sprint LG G2 on Sprint's network."
it is great.
"I have been searching for a good quality case for my s6 that looks nice and protects my phone at the same time. I have tried quite a few but this one is definitely my favorite. The high-quality leather case makes it easy to hold on to and looks great when Im using it. I love that I am still able to plug in my charger while I have my case on, unlike other cases that I have tried. This case fits great on my phone and it does not slide off. My favorite thing about this case is how slim it is. Other cases that I have tried are super bulky, but this is not and it still allows me to carry my phone in my back pocket. The gold accents give it a real classy look that I love. I will definitely be using this case for a while. I was graciously provided a discount on this case in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are my own."
Just ok.  I bought a few & 1 broke so it doesn't hold the cell phone in place.  The other one takes rapid fire pictures when it feels like it off & on.
"I was debating either this case or the spegin case and I went with this one due to more variety of colors. Side buttons work great. It does increase the size of the phone, but what case doesnt. I love it!"
It looks and fits great but it fell ones and it shattered a corner to pices
This was not what I was looking for.  It didn't fit my I Phone 5C as recommended from the supplier.  I had to return it.
So far so good. I have not checked the water proof quality but it will do for every day use.
Love the color and quality. The fast delivery was great!!!
Fits perfect! Love this case!
Thank you!
The quality wasn't good enough for me
Love it I use it everyday and it charges my phone to
This is my second Maxboost case.  The first case was with my iPhone 6 which it is still in use after 9 months.  I got this case to go on my work phone which is a 5S.  It fits perfectly and really looks good.  You can't go wrong with this case.
Came on timer super great. So far they work great! Really long nice for across the room and across the car!
"Got it today, its going back tomorrow, its that bad. This is something you would find at the thrift dollar store only nobody would buy it for even a buck so it would be on clearence for .50 cents! It is that cheap feeling. The fabric is probably the cheapest stuff ever produced and the &#34;bean balls&#34; inside are so light that they dont hold the phone worth a crap. This has to be the worst product ive ever purchased on amazon. DO NOT BELIEVE ANY REVIEW HIGHER THAN 2 STARS, because nobody in their right mind would think this is a good product for more than $1 at the dollar store."
This case is slim and sleek while still giving my phone the protection that I need. It took a little concentration to apply but I am VERY happy with my purchase and will be buying this brand again.
This phone works great and I have had no issues since buying it! The phone is in really good shape and the only thing wrong was some sticker residue. Glad I made this purchase!
I really like this case! The kick stand is a little cheap but I don't think I'll use it anyways. The case seems really protective and has a high lip around the screen.
Love it. So easy to install and it's still working great. Feel so much better to save a lot of money for DIY.<br />Good thing about this item is that everything came with it. Just installed and that's it.
This fits my need perfectly.  I like they sideways ease of use and the clip for the belt is very well made and should last.
Honestly don't get why everyone is saying it does t work. I had someone who knows what they are doing repair mine and it was just fine
Way to tight. Be careful I am afraid it will break your phone. It did mine :(
"Bought this for an old truck that only the radio works. Works great, little bit hissy just like listening to cassette tapes."
Great emergency solar charger.
"Love it! I had this same screen protector for 2 Years and it's great, the only screen protector that has truly protected my screen from cracking!!"
I love this thing. I take it everywhere
durable.  doesn't peel.  good protection.
I love it
Great product
"Works great, does what it says. Great buy."
Falls apart quick.  Need a new one or some thing.  Maybe a new replacement for free would be nice.
"The generic wireless charging plate does the job, the only thing is that you should center your phone in order it charges property, but for the price you can't go wrong, and the delivery was really fast."
"I've only used this once so far, but it kept my iPhone dry and allowed me to get some great, clear photos on a white-water rafting trip. Submerged in water, and worked flawlessly. I recommend this product."
I like it but it could fit on a lil tighter. Overall very happy with it.
"the design and colors for this case is so pretty. However, I was a little disappointed when I received the case and noticed it didn't have a front magnetic clasp to keep the case shut. Overlooked this when looking at the images before purchasing. If you don't mind the case not having a flap to keep it closed then this will be fine for you. I ended up purchasing another case with a flap to keep it closed."
The reasons I didn't give them 5 stars is that I would like to see smaller buds or wrap around ear hooks.
Very fast for galaxy S5. CAUTION: i suggest charge your phone to 60% then let it cooled down for little bit. Because it might EXPLODE. Take care of your stuff. Bye haha
Revised Review:  Had a problem with one of the two working.  However Anker contacted me directly and voluntarily shipped out a replacement without any question.  So higher rating for excellent customer service response.  These do fit nicely inside the holder with Anker charger/converter.  (Earlier review: Shipped two - one worked.  One did not.)
Came extremely quick! I love this case!! Buy this!!
Good product
Perfect fit looks great
"Love this cord, works great with my iphone 6, gives a fast charge and is entertaining to watch!"
Really good case for a really good price. No need to spend more money.
"Love!!!!!<br /><br />***UPDATE - 6 months later and I still LOVE!!!  My phone goes everywhere I go, room to room, inside outside, so it gets handled a lot. And this case can handle it!! It still looks new. Not one loose stitch, pockets still tight.  Magnet still strong. You do have to open clutch to take picture, which at times bothers me - but I am not a big picture taker so no biggie.  No longer carry purse cause this has all my personal id's, credit cards that I need. I am very impressed with this case and would buy again!!"
The unit did not work!
Did not work at all!!!
little bit of a a pain to get the cord in but so cute love it.
"content OK, shipment OK, I'd recommend. Thx"
"Excellent product a lot of use-full features not like many others with useless bells and whistles. it's very practical. Instruction manual very well put together. Radio signal is excellent, I love the I phone pairing feature<br />. I am using this radio on a boat and before with older radio I could only catch couple stations. But now is so many to choose from. This radio is so so smart it practically does every thing for you. when you set it on automatic set up. I love my new toy.<br />I would recommend this radio at any time."
Great price and fast shipping highly recommended.
"Not at Twelve South regular standards, just as many in here and as the pictures show, the soft touch on the case is gone and the wallet is falling apart after a month, i got a replacement from twelve south which followed the same fate as the first wallet. This product is such a disappointment. I've had Twelve South's book book since they brought it out to market and they always been a great crafted wallet. This version for the Iphone 6 is complete crap. Don't waste your money unless they bring back the quality wallets they used to have."
It's great
The absolute best in quality and customer service!
works looks great looks good
I really like this. I took a 30 minute drive consisting of sharp turns and potholes and my phone stayed in the holder the whole time. It's very secure and easy to install. Ipow is a great brand but DO NOT purchase this from Lunar Tech Deals. They have horrible customer service.
Excellent!
It keep falling off the windshield and it wont stick to the dash at all.  I was not at all happy with this.
Pressing the button would not take a picture. I tried it with two phones. The directions said to download the Camera 360 app if the stock camera app didn't take a picture when the button was pushed. I downloaded Camera 360 but the button still didn't operate the camera. Needless to say I was very disappointed and returned it.
It's not how it's presented and the charger doesn't work at all. It's a waste of money.
It's clear. It was cut correctly. Good job makers of cut plastic thingy.
Another quality Anker product. I've used their stuff for a couple years and it is well-made and works great.
Love it!
Doesn't have an opening for the off and on and the volume other than that it would have been fine you literally have to take the device out of the case just to turn it on and off.
"so i ordered this case because fall out boy is my favorite band. it actually came in the mail sooner than the expected delivery date said, which is a  big plus. didnt have a problem putting the case on my phone which is  a samsung galaxy S3. the only problem with it which is really minor, if you put the case on, it stays on, and i mean  its sorta hard to get off. but other than that its awesome. great quality. would recommend!"
too chunky and thick to be used with iPad or iPhone case on devices.
"I really wanted to like this phone, I have several other ASUS products and they have been flawless, but this phone is not one of those products. Problems I've had with this phone: randomly reboots itself at least once a day, apps are constantly freezing forcing me to hold down the power button to restart the phone, when returning to the home screen from any app it takes at least 15-20 seconds before the home screen loads, when the apps aren't just freezing completely up they run really slowly, and there is A LOT of ASUS included bloadware pre-installed on this phone. Overall I'd say save the money and get a Samsung or LG phone as I've used both brands and had no issues with either."
Works great gas shipment
great battery I think better than oem battery
Excellent case
I love my little sound pod! So simple and works so well. I love that it looks super cute even when nothing is it it too.
I finally received my anker 10ft today.. excellent condition.. works very well ... overall I am please with my purchase.. Thank You!
Fast delivery and same as advertised.
"Work quite well, easy pairing and good volume control, stay in the ear well."
Love it!
Super easy to do.  Knocked it out in 10 minutes.
Phone arrived but all settings were in Singapore language.  Could not read anything on Google. Disappointed.
"This phone case has been a disappointment, 3days after I receive  it the stones came off,the two large on top,also the stones around it as tarter to snag my close. So, I am so disappointed, never experience this before with none of my products I have purchase."
"Exactly what it says, I've bought 5 cars and this one is by far my favorite. I have two!"
Sender provided extra goodies and that's always a plus.
"Fits perfectly, lots of extra room for my other cables and earbuds. Great quality and very sturdy material. Protects the headphones wonderfully!"
"We have an older Sound Dock that has the old style iDevice connector. We had stopped using it because we didn't have any working devices that had that connector anymore. Luckily, I was able to find this Bluetooth adapter. It works well, has pretty decent range, and sounds good (a bit bass heavy, but very clear). My only complaint is that it seems that the only way to &#34;wake&#34; the adapter is to unplug it and plug it back in. That's a minor issue, though."
The perfect tool for those who travel in remote regions and desire to have cell bar signals 24/7.
"I've had this iPhone cover for about a month and a half now.  Love it!  Love the scripture, the colors, the design!"
Just as described
The product works as expected.
Works great. Good fit.
The speaker & microphone work well. The head band is a little long and fails to firmly hold everything in place.
The screen protector was pretty good on my note 5. I wish it covered a little more on the width but with a case the fitting was perfect. However my first shipment of this product came with a slight blemish but amazon sent me a replacement right away. Overall a good product for the price.
"For the price this is a good upgrade from cardboard itself.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good wide FOV<br />Good build quality plastic<br />Magnet trap door that snaps<br />No fancy suction to hold mobile (like some other VR headsets), instead relies on friction between sponge pads and phone to keep it in place<br />Very small pincushion distortion<br />Mild chromatic aberration especially for its price<br />Wide IPD (i can put it on with my glasses on)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Uses Fresnel lens (although technically not an issue) causes nasty ghosting (halo) on images<br />Nose pad may be painful after long use<br /><br />Overall: Cant beat this performance for the price."
I love this cord! I've always used the 3feet cords and I'm so glad I had a chance to try this one. I don't think I will ever go back using or buying a shorter cord for my phone and iPad. This is so much easier and convenient. I love that I can use my iPad to read lying down in my bed while it is being charged. I don't have to worry about running out of battery. I've been using it for a while and so far it still works great. Although I received this cord free to try and review I will definitely buy it  when I need another one!
"This case was exactly what I expected with the exception of the supplied screen protector. I had hoped that it would cover the whole screen, but it leaves the top half inch of the screen unprotected."
muy bien
Works great with iPhone 5c and iPad air !
Was even better then I thought...easy install and it really does protect your investment...great product
"sleek and sturdy, two things I was looking for"
"NEVER buy this!!! If I could give it a zero, I would!  I have been through 3 of these protectors as they break easily. On my previous phone with a different protector I didn't have this problem EVER. The glass is so thick that you have trouble with connectivity and lose functionality of your phone on buttons that are located around the edge of your screen. Don't even think about purchasing....you will be unhappy."
Dead in 3 days....
they fly
"I have trusted OtterBox for as long as I can remember; however, I have become addicted to LifeProof over this last six months. I guess I liked the clear case and slick look. Nonetheless, when I put this case on my Galaxy (work-phone), I remembered why I LOVE OtterBox. Not only is it fairly professional looking (it is a pretty basic, simple looking case), but it really is like encasing your phone in safety!<br />This case WILL hold up to a serious drop, it will (obviously) protect your phone from scratches and scuffs, and it will give it a pretty cool, polished look.<br /><br />LifeProof is PRICY. And, when I put this on, I realized that OtterBox is slightly better for everyday use than LifeProof (unless you are a devout hiker or outdoors person ... then, LifeProof might be the way to go).<br /><br />So highly recommended!"
"keeps phone completely dry, It's only flaw is it's difficult to press the picture button under water."
Lasted a week before it stopped working.
Great
Agree with previous reviews. Very nice and really like the versatility. If the material ends up stretching slightly it will be perfect!
Great build quality and lightweight. I love the case and cable it comes with because it makes it really portable. I charged my phone with it and even had enough power to continue charging my controller while playing games on my PS4. I might be buying a few more.
"I really like this product it feels really smooth, the touch works perfect, easy installation and its really good quality so your iPhone screen will be protected."
It's not good Quality
"My Mpow Bluetooth does not work after 4 weeks.  After recharge, the Mpow button keeps blinking red and there is no sound.  I would like to replace or repair it.  Pls contact me for what to do next.  Thank you."
"Love the sound, and it's a great value too."
"worked well, but I wished it had a longer cable than 6 ft."
This cable is great! I've had it for over a month without any problems at all.  The extra long plug allows music to be played via Life Proof Case covered smart phone. Keeps mom and teenager both happy lol
Product was in good shape.. NEW.  It works perfect.
I absolutely loved it and it looks like the exact picture!
"This is a great product for the value.  Installation was very easy.  You will probably need to purchase a long A/V cable to reach from end of the vehicle to the other.  Camera works great, even at night.  I installed mine in my Ford F150 to make backing to trailers easier.  I wish I had installed this a long time ago."
"Worked as advertised on an AT&T iPhone 5 (16GB). Is a detailed repair, not for a novice. iFixit guide worked great and unit has been used for about two weeks with no issues."
Charger works fine. But I had searched for &#34;iphone 6 car charger&#34; and this popped up so I never even thought to confirm it was actually for an iPhone 6 since I'd specifically typed that. Used the car base and bought a new cord. Not sure if Amazon or seller/Belkin was misleading but a pain either way. But the car charger base works just fine.
"This case is awesome and it fits and functions great on my phone, dust and splash resistant with all the ports covered!<br />Would recommend!"
"it fit the phone fine, but it was too slippery. I felt I was going to drop it."
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this skin for a Zune HD, but it was nice to see that it installed easily, and had attractive bevels on the back which mimic the HD's case.  With this and a screen protector, the only thing exposed now is the single small button on the front.  The side button is pressed easily through the silicone sleeve.  For the price, this is a steal, and I may very well order another sleeve or two for future use."
Cover phone nicely.
"Works great, good product"
Best customer service but cheap make and never last needs to fix it!!!
Hard to aim the screen protector with the tablets speaker/camera they don't seem to aline correctly.  But in all its not a bad screen protector works pretty good
"Very interesting item. It took awhile for me to focus but once I did, it worked.  I purchased at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Works perfect!
Worked great!
"I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. The product is of fine quality, is extremely durable, professional, light-weight, and is very short in comparison to the huge 2-port USB car chargers. This charger is unique in that it is extremely compatible and prevents over-heat by stopping immediately when the charge is complete. Since, I am using<br />my phone all the time - I usually tend to run out of battery by the afternoon. This charger is very cost-efficient and speedy. The charger itself is very easy to use - you just have to plug it into the socket attaching a USB charger from the USB port to your phone. I noticed that it charges quicker when the phone is off / wifi-3g is off, and so I feel its preferable to use it that way - for better and faster results . Very pleased. A+! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
It was a gift for my son and he was thrilled with it. It's doing it's job and keeping his phone protected.
this was a terrible case. does not fit the iphone 6 and it broke when i tried to put it on.
Worked perfectly
"I LOVE this case! It is not bulky like other cases, so you can still show off the thin-ness and beauty of your phone while protecting it at the same time. What I love most is the kick-stand on the back. It makes for easy propping of my phone when my daughter is using it to watch a video. While this case IS NOT waterproof, it is shockproof, so if you drop your phone from average heights, the case absorbs the impact pretty well. This case fits on perfectly with my current screen protector as well, so that is always a plus! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
ok
1 week in. Quality feels excellent for $. This has 3 card slots and the cash pocket so be aware. I hope the 6s+ case is of equal or better design.
after assembling the screen it immediatly came apart on the sides.  not cheap to buy and really disappointed that the quality is not that great.
"what i expected, keeps scratches away but wont really be protected if it falls although its not a snap on so the cover stays on. great fit."
"Overall, this a great screen protector. Fits the iphone 6 as advertised, slightly smaller than the screen leaving a 1/8 inch of screen exposed around the edge. The protector I received had some slight defects with the beveled edge, but they are tolerable."
Great
Love the quality.
Got this today and it batter thin I thought it would be fits on my arms i would recommend everyone to buy This for themselves<br />I got this product for a review and it was worth it
Great
"Been using it for one week now, works great"
As awesome as one can plainly see from the picture and arrived sooner than estimated.
Nice case. A little less metallic than I expected but sturdy material
"Overall, this is a pretty good charger that does the job. If I could recommend an improvement would be to make the cord just a little bit longer.  Similar to other Amazon Basics-branded items I have purchased the components of this set are not the lower-quality replacement charging components we have all purchased at some time in our lives - it appears to be very durable, and I don't think I'm going to break off an end after pulling on the head to take it out of the cigarette adapter in the car.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good-quality and economical charger for your car I would recommend this one."
Didn't buy these on amazon but at one of those rip off cell phone stores.  My disappointment with this product is that it leaves big areas around the ear/lens section and button section exposed and uncovered.  The box picture doesn't depict this.
It did not work on any of my devices
Excellent.
"I use it in my '98 Buick Regal and I have driven upwards of 2 hours around the Austin area with literally NO interference or issues.  I've used it almost on a daily basis for 2 months and not had a single problem; music and GPS comes through from my iPhone 6 plus crystal clear, and all this success from the very first station I tried it with."
Awesome
I have always used Otter boxes.  I took a chance on this and I really like it.  It is durable and more streamlined than my other cases.
"Great adapter to use in the car, both kids can watch the same movie at the same time"
Great Seller and Great Product!!!
Good!
Bottom of case where charger connects broke of within a month
Great band.  Comfortable and fits nice.
The color is really nice and I love how it protects my phone
nice versatility however not quick to use
"This item wasn't a reliable product. After two weeks of having it, under 2-3 uses, the outlet usb adapter died on me. It was left charging a galaxy tab and found died in the morning, while not even charging the device. Worst investment ever. I won't buy from Aukey again. smh."
This simple to use Selfie Stick works great. It is very easy to setup with your phone or tablet. I synced it with both just to see. My phone runs on IOS and my tablet is Android. Both synced within seconds and worked perfectly. It has a 35 inch extension. Which is pretty good for a selfie stick. It also slides into its self to make it easy to travel with. It comes with a charging cable so no need to go out and buy one. All in all this selfie stick has a lot to offer for the selfier on the go.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review.
"Great case!  I've had mine for a few months now, and it looks and performs great!"
My new case is exactly what I had expected! I'm very pleased! It arrived quickly and was packaged very well!
"Cons:<br /><br />- Sound quality is merely okay. A bit thin sounding--lacking bass. Not ideal for serious music listening.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Excellent phone headset (which is what I bought them for)<br />- Bluetooth stuff works great, with great range, and low confusion.<br />- They stay in my ears much better than other earbuds I've tried. I haven't tried running, but if I do, I'll update<br />- So nice not having wires everywhere! I like to pace when I'm on the phone, and now I can do it without wires everywhere."
"Excellent cell phone case! Very attractive- sleek design with magnet closure, and protective too! Case is just slightly bulkier than I imagined, but I am very happy with the product!"
2 of them did not work
"I've had this case for a year and a half now, and bought it because Otterbox, which I had on my old Blackberry, didn't make one for the Z30.<br />It's been great. Worth it."
Doesn't match my phones color 100% but fits great
okay
"Its a very cheap product. Don't waste your money buying it. When i plugged this in to my car charging port, it blowed the charging port fuse. I went to a mechanic and fixed the fuse. Again plugged in this one, it did same thing after.  I wont recommend this."
Good color and very useful for college students.  However the wristband is pretty cheap quality and feels like it will rip any moment.
"It is a beautiful case, but the rubber edge on the magnet flap is ripping off, the leather edges of the kiss are also breaking apart. Find another case that will last longer."
fits my needs
it does fit for the 6 plus I have the case on right now I love it!
"First of all, this (Gray/Orange) ASHIELD protective cover fits my LG Ultimate 2 perfectly and I can manipulate the controls with no problems.  The orange cover is soft and almost squishy.  The gray part is hard plastic.  This means I can maintain a good grip while holding my phone and although I feel confident the cover would protect it well from a drop, I cannot attest that it is &#34;Amy&#34;-Grade, LOL.  I don't use the holster, but it seems substantial and the belt clip can be turned for vertical or horizontal carry.  The holes line up and the cover does not negatively impact the mic, speaker, camera, or controls.  The USB port does have a flap that can be a little persnickety to open when you want to connect the cable. But, it probably most definitely helps keep dust and moisture out.  So it's a positive.  The picture accurately reflects the color and I've gotten lots of positive comments on how it looks.  More importantly, I can now spot my phone easily when I lay it down amongst my other junk or the cat lays on it.  I feel like I got my money's worth and I'd buy it again."
Works well
My daughter loves this case.  Looks like it costs much more than 10.00!  Keeps phone protected.
Love this connection it works perfectly and i have no complaints.
It's good. Warranty rocks.
Looks JUST like the photo and I like the no slip grip on the side of the case. I guess mine isn't slipping b/c I put a magnet insert in the back for a hands free car mount.
Just as advertised.
I cannot get my Bluetooth to pair with my phone. I have called Sony tech support and they do not deal with Sony Ericsson products anymore. The radio works fine.
My niece loved this cover.  It provides great protection for the iPhone.
Fell apart
"It's not easy to find a great charger for the earlier generation Apple products - so I jumped on the opportunity to purchase this portable battery pack. My husband has an iPhone 5S and an 'older' iPad, he was immediately impressed with how compact it is and how many plugs it included.<br />This is a product he immediately put in his briefcase since it arrived. On a daily basis he drives over 100 miles for work so no more dead phone or waiting to get into the car to recharge.<br /><br />Note: I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for a fair and unbiased review."
Love the durability and color. The biggest issue is I can't get the case to close securely around the entire tablet. It's only on one side. It seems like the silicone is too big. I'll have to look for another product.
"Having used this for 2 yrs and this is the2nd one purchased, never disappoint with Apple products"
I love it.
"Fit the phone well, easy to apply, seems to provide good protection."
"It's very cheap. The sound produced by the headphones is surprisingly good. Fit is great - it's very comfortable, but it never falls off one's head."
Very durable
"The iPhone 4s products come just as described,thank you!"
Great phone!
Love this case! Perfect color and great quality for the price. I also like that it protects my screen and doesn't get stretched out!
My products are good !! Thanks
I've purchase 1 in every color since trying out my first one. The material feels the same & the bands act the same as my Apple sport bands. They are perfect!
loved it so much bought one for my mother in law<br />With stood my dog chewing on it<br />and had for while now and still working and i use and move it around daily
Great case for a great price. Better than expected.
great case works as expected
"Great product, good price."
The joint between the base and the arm doesn't have enough tension to hold my phone up. Because of this my phone ended up flopping around and flying out of the holder on several occasions. It could have easily taken a bad trajectory and landed screen first on a hard surface. I say use at your own risk...
Great light weight bluetooth headphones! It feels cheap but works like a charm!!
Updated: This plug did fit my iPhone 5c (make sure to remove the phone from the case as this may prevent the plug from going all the way in) and it fits the iPad 4th Gen. This plug is thicker than the OEM Apple lightning charger and this is why it did not fit my iPhone initially while it was in the case.
I am actually pretty happy with it. It does what it says it does and it came with a waterproof bag that I can put a hook on if I do water sports or anything on the water! It does on the other hand become really hard to open once its sealed on your iPod.
nice band for apple watch and stylish
"great fit and comfort, battery life at 4.5 hours is a pain to charge often, and the interruption of signal can occur easily if iPhone or other device is not worn correctly, get a belt to hold the iPod on right side and there is limited issues"
"I've been using this phone for a few weeks now after switching off my Galaxy S3.  I loved the GS3 when it was new but it's been showing its age and slowing down tremendously.<br /><br />The LG G3 is a great successor.  It's mostly vanilla Android which is great but there are a few cool features I use a lot.<br /><br />1) double tap on the screen to turn on/off - love not having to feel around the back for the power button only to (inevitably) press on the camera lens (if there was any downside to the design, that would be it.  Circular power button just below the circular camera?  not smart, LG)<br />2) This was a one time setup thing, but using NFC to pull my settings and apps from my GS3 to the G3 was awesome and such a time saver.  Well done, Android!<br /><br />One more thing, I was looking at this phone over some of it's competitors mostly to get the best camera in an android phone and this does not disappoint.  It has taken crystal clear pictures.  I really like the camera interface and I like how I can use hand gestures to take the picture.  This makes taking a selfie with my baby to send to my wife a snap (HA! get it?)."
"The suction cup doesn't stick to anything. I've cleaned every surface and the cup itself and tried all over my car with out any success. I did manage to find 1 spot that lasted about 24hrs before it pulled off a awkward spot on my door under the drivers side window where I managed to get it to stick, then of course it fell off at the worst possible time as I was driving and fell to the side of my seat, then moved Milameters at a time just far enough so I couldn't reach it as I was driving. So I ended up hearing my phone ring all the way back to my house because I had it hooked to my car speakers listening to music. The 1 plus of this thing is the magnet works very well, oh which reminds me, after getting this thing I slowly realized that the metal tabs that you hooked to your phone that this mount sticks to blocks your signal. I didn't realize what was going on until I back tracked the time in which my signal started messing up to the time this came in. All in all use the &#34;life hack&#34; version of the car phone mount and use a rubber band that will go through your air vent slats/grill and back out holding your phone to the air vent."
"One week after purchasing this case for my NEW phone, I left the phone on the top of my car and drove off!  Hours later my son received a call from my phone when it was found.  Not a SCRATCH on the case or phone!  Couldn't have asked for a better outcome!"
Wife likes it.
"This case is intense! For someone like me who drops their phone on a regular basis this is a must have! I would say that this case is tougher than an Otterbox and a lot cheaper too! If you want to protect your phone without breaking the bank, be sure to grab one of these cases. The belt clip is also a great addition for people who are used to carrying their phones that way. I recommend this case to anyone! This product was given to me at a discount in exchange for an accurate and honest review!<br /><br />-H"
Crappie it says Cable charging and you have to toggle with the cable in order for it to work.
Work good
"Found it to be just what I wanted...comfortable, easy to put on, grips well, and kept my phone sweat-free."
"Good product, highly recommended"
"Make sure you watch the video on how to install. Everything in the kit makes applying the screen protector so much easier and it doesn't leave behind lint or residue.<br /><br />So far I am happy with the screen protector. I previously had an ZAGG Invisible Shield which cracked a couple weeks after I bought it and I hadn't even dropped my phone. It eventually completely shattered and even though I had a warranty on it, I didn't think it was worth it so I did some research and found the Maxboost which has excellent ratings and is half the price of the ZAGG shield.<br /><br />It overs more of the phone than ZAGG and is easier to install. I feel confident that it will protect my phone."
Junk!!
"amazing fit, seems sturdy, plus you get a leather picture or card holder with purchase. it is not 3-d its just printed to look like that. Coolest phone case i have ever seen."
"I bought it for my wife, she love this case."
"LOVE IT!! Wow! What a great bargain! This case is perfectly clear and nice and rubbery! It feels just like the much more expensive one that I purchased at the Apple store for my iPhone5 way back when. I love that the case covers the back of the phone, while keeping all the necessary slots open. However, it loses 1 star because the lightening adapter does not fit! (Womp womp womp). Other than that it's a great buy!"
"This little speaker is great,very load for a small speaker with decent sound and charge lasts a long time,I'm very pleased with this speaker considering the price."
"This is a fun little gadget! If you are like me and enjoy taking selfies and group photos but have a hard time getting everyone in the picture, this makes it SO much easier!<br /><br />It's pretty small when folded down, which is nice because I can just toss it in my purse and take it out whenever needed for a fun picture or group photo. It held my Galaxy S4 with no problem, but it was a bit of a stretch for my husbands iPhone 6Plus. It may be suited to smaller phones, just to be sure that they are held in place nice and tight. Nothing will ruin a selfie quicker than having the phone come crashing down, right?<br /><br />The Bluetooth was easy to pair and synced to my phone quickly. With the push of a button, I can take my pics and it has not given me any problems at all so far. I received one to review and have had a lot of fun playing around with it since it arrived. This would also definitely make an awesome gift for any selfie lover you might know!"
Great product fits good<br />Thank you!
"First things first, let's point out what's good about it; it keeps it pretty much dry, and dust is prevented too. It snaps on pretty tightly.<br /><br />What's bad; you lose your silence button on the side of the phone. You cannot switch it, no matter how hard you try. The screen is cheap, and you can see grid dots in it. Mine came with scratches in the screen too. Every scratch you make on the back of it shows badly. (Black case) just from every day handling. If you want to use headphones, you have to screw in the adapter on account that the jack is too deep now from the case's depth. It is a cheap alternative to the &#34;life proof&#34; case, but it comes with sacrifices I do not want to make. The screen also has a glare to it. It takes away from the brilliant brightness that the iPhone is known for. I'm returning mine."
I bought this thinking that I could replace all of my chargers by my bedside with this but guess what? 1 of the ports died.<br />So disappointed. Wouldn't recommend buying.<br />Spent my money and time researching this product for nothing.<br />They should've made better products if they want to survive.
Fell apart in a few weeks at every hinge. Not recommended.
"The car mount is easy to attach and release, and once the phone is affixed to the mount, it seems pretty secure - it hasn't fallen off.  However, the combined weight of the phone and the mount tends to close the vent."
"The seller is amazing, the product, not so mych, I bought 2, the 1st one was replaced immediately, still waiting on this one to be processed... Not a great tablet at all, I am thinking I'd rather have my money back rather than the replacement, but let's play it out and see how it goes...don't But this tablet if you want durability and longevity, neither of them lasted a week before they went out... Very dissappointed in these tablets"
I ordered the case and within three days it was here! Looks great on the tablet it's not bulky at all I love it!
Absolutely awesome product for middle and high school kids....got two of my grandkids two sets each.. ..they love them and me for getting them!
"great at first,  then I noticed one of the sides was becoming loose,  so theres a noticable gap between the soft case and the hard poly carb shell."
I bought this case and i have a verizon lg g2 and when i recieved the case it said non verizon carries only but did not say it anywhere in the description. I am super frustrated and would like a refund since that was not stated in the description.
Great system. Easy to install.
Great product and great price!
"Clip ripped off in a month,still give it 2 stars because I think it will be okay wearing it on the belt. Could not have used the belt sleeve without the clip getting in the way until the clip ripped off. It's like they knew the clip would be temporary so they had the sleeve so you could wear it on the belt after the clip gave out."
It does just what I need it to do
"So far, no problems."
I relieved my case in two days with prime membership.  The clear case looked great when I first put it OK now my new Galaxy S6 Edge+ and it fits just perfectly like a glove.  Unfortunately it is not scratch resistant.  The very first day of usage I saw scratches on it and it was in my purse pocket with nothing else in it.  My phone does not look as glamorous as it should with these scratches on the crystal clear cover.
"Outstanding iPhone,like it.!"
"Over stretched rubber, plastic piece doesn't fully click, rubber tab don't stay in, hard to type on click screen"
No good I can't use it! Makes me sound muffled when I am talking!
dont stay on as well as i want and is cheaply made.
Product works great charging two devices
Met it's purpose
very cheap. i threw it away
"I bought this unit and it looks great for my 2008 Honda Accord.  I installed it myself, also install a back up camera. The compliments I get on the new unit is great. I would really recommend this to anybody that's looking to upgrade.  Bluetooth for the phone  another great feature. All my steering wheel controls still work."
This case is HORRIBLE! it DOES NOT WORK! My son cracked his phone screen the first week he got this case.<br />It did NOT protect his phone at all and now we have to replace a screen and pay an insurance deductible.
"My wife and I both bought IPhone 6's and we wanted slim cases. If you're looking for moderate protection with little bulk, this affordable case is a great option. It's sleek and has nice styling; plastic on the side and back and durable rubber on the top, bottom and corners.<br /><br />My wife purchased a comparable otter box symmetry and I like this better.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price<br />Durable<br />Stylish<br />No loss of key use<br /><br />Cons:<br />2 piece design (plastic shell snaps over rubber)<br />Would like better grip on sides"
They're gooby
This case is so great!!!! It is such a great quality phone case at a great price!!!
Shipped quickly and works perfectly! It even came with a screen protector.
Very practical.
"This product is better than the $1 or $2 chinese knockoffs, but still is prone to early failure. I bought three of these about 6 months ago, and one of them is pretty much dead, one is on its way out, and the third is still going strong.  The cable looks nice and feels like it is good quality. When they were brand new all of the devices worked seamlessly with it, but over time I could see the pins on the lightning connector start to wear off.  Bottom line: I would pay about $5 for this cable, nothing more."
Bought this and gave them a try and let me tell you how they are had for like a month now bought back in August so for he price is not bad paid like $5.00 dlrs around I have iPhone 6 4.7 with otter box and installation is not that bad the only thing it will not work if u use the otter box because it won't sense your finger its to many plastics so what I did I cut out the screen on my otter box and whola perfect true screen size is a little tight could of use like a couple of millimeters more but besides that I like it no more nosey people peeping on your screen 😆
As described and fast shipping.  Satisfied customer.
Half star really... convenient I think not cool idea bad execution.
Got this for my wife.  She really likes it.  The only issue is that the case is too think for the wireless charger to work correctly.
Excellent products. Super fast shopper. I will order again!
Good quality for the price
This Ballistic Glass Saved my phone this morning.  I was working out and my phone fell off the treadmill on to cement.  I didn't see any issues until I was in my car.  It looked like the screen was cracked all the way across.  After looking at the phone closer I pealed off the ballistic glass and realized it was the only think cracked.  I had decided to go with the Tech Armor Premium Ballistic Glass for a screen protector after breaking two screens on different phones.  I would recommend this screen to everyone.  I am extremely impressed and can not believe how well it protected my phone.  This glass did what it was supposed to.
they work great
"Perfect case for my phone.  It protects while providing a slim, classy cover."
Nice little case that does not add a lot of bulk to the phone.  It makes it easy to spot which phone is which.  It also makes the phone easy to hold on to.
Great item and fast delivery
Total piece of crap- use your iPhone. I got lost out of Boston Logan. This thing can't be trusted. My trusty iPhone worked. What the hell was I thinking?
"Great radar detector and is very easy to use. I have owned a Cobra before and this one is just as impressive. For the price and quality, I highly recommend the Cobra XRS9470."
Very good mount so far.  Sticks to my textured dash very solid.  Fits my note 4 easily.
"This is the best cord by far I've ever owned!! Very rugged, durable and super affordable!!! I totally recommend this cord, even more so now that I plan on purchasing the 2 foot cord in a different color!!!"
"Case makes screen shut off when using the voice to text function. I tried it with no case and there's no problem with voice to text and I tried it with my old case , also no problem. So I know it is the new case."
It was an insanely good deal and it'll charge my phone while it's charging itself. The flashlight is nifty although I haven't used it yet.
"Yes there's no bass but that's why they accompany my Rockford subs so well, all the vocals and instruments from my door speakers, bass from the subs, you cannot go wrong"
It's low quality and it didn't fit my phone
Love it
"Great receiver, especially for the price, only wish it had come with the mounting bracket and wiring harness from my vehicle.  The information wasn't quite clear on what was included and/or required for he installation.  Regardless, the receiver works great and easily pairs with my phone for IM, phone and musing control.  The Aux and USB interfaces work great, and the USB port charges my phone at the same time - great benefit!  The interface is fully customizable, to the point where it may be overwhelming to some.  I enjoyed the vast array of configs so that I could make the interface my own.  The receiver does a good job of pushing out a high quality audio experience which on it's own is quite loud enough for my enjoyment!"
It was just what I wanted!
Thinner than other cases I have used.  Materials seem to be high quality.  it feels really good in my hand holding the phone.  The fit is excellent.  I tried my remote function for the TV and it worked fine.
"I like the finer tip in these for writing on my iPad. I have other similar with more fat rounded tips, but these give finer control. My son tried one and liked enough to keep it, so they have the millennial stamp of approval along with the baby boomers. Good product at a good price."
😋
"This is a great alternative to an Otter box case, my husband is very hard on phones and hates Otter boxes due to the bulkiness of the cases, he has dropped his phone many many times, but this case has held up perfectly! Also the kick stand makes for easy video watching while feeding a baby. Lol"
"used the Plantronics BackBeat Headphones for three months before the right ear bud stopped delivering sound.  amazon has a one-month return policy, so I'm stuck with half a headset.  nice color, however."
great case a little thicker but really tuff
"love love love!!!  This has solved my problem of going out or shopping and not wanting to take my purse with me.  Holds a folded bill, drivers license and credit card.  So now all i need are my keys, and phone and I am ready to go!  At least once a day someone remarks about my wonderful case! Highly recommend!"
All I can say is great product
Doesnt work well at all thru via cell its real hazy watchingh anything off of phone ... dont buy it
Great product.
Good product
It charged my Note and iPhone with no problem.  Great when you need an extra charging port in your car.<br /><br />I received this sample in exchange for an unbiased review.
As i rated it it's ok only thing i hate about it compared to my samsung galaxy s3 i had is that it don't have much led notifications it only appears to have red and green  and i use skype so now if left on i dont get  a notification  color since its usually blue for skype when someone messages me i can only see someone left me a message  when i turn screen on so this really sucks along with other apps too. but  other then that its ok.
The 2nd charging port just stopped working out of no where.  Terrible product
Used on vacation and got some awesome underwater pics.  Video's were cool too.  Phones stayed dry in the case.
"Fabulous!  Such an easy, inexpensive fix for my expensive Bose docking station, which has been sitting in my closet for several years since it ceased to pair with my iphone."
"Has lasted me a long time, a must have if you have a cell phone! I would've rated it 5 stars but since the button sometimes turns on or off in my bag I took the star off. The button is too easily pressed."
The case came between the estimated delivery date. It looks great and protects my phone fabulously. I dropped my phone with this case and not a scratch. I'm really happy with this case! :)
"Love this, holds everything required. Only way to improve,  would be to add belt chip!!"
Love my wallet case. I ordered a second one shortly after purchasing my first because once the first falls apart (as all wallets and/or cases do) over time...I wanted a backup on hand! Would easily order more if needed!
The plastic clamshell casing at the Lightning connector end broke open. The epoxy/grey glue was still in place. No signs of bent or broken wiring/epoxy. Not worth the money.
"I've been using this case for the past 4 months. It hasn't been off the phone for more than a few minutes since I've got it. I love the card holder feature. I no longer carry a wallet with me, which is great. It holds my driver's license and debit card perfectly and the door opens and closes easily but only when I want it to. Haven't  had any issues with it opening unexpectedly or loosing my cards. I do construction so this case takes more than typical abuse and has stood up to it well. It does make the phone a little bulky but still better than carrying a wallet and a phone."
Product came in cracked so I tried using it anyway.. Finally just bought another one ..it seemed pretty good just didn't like the fact it was broke when I got it.
"Eh. Find a better case, it gets dirty wayyy too fast and it's hard to clean."
Great little speaker for the money. Have synced it to my iPhone and iPad. It really puts out some sound. Great value too. I have played music on it inside the house with the windows open and can hear the music outside. It can be played very loud without distortion of music. Going to take it in my Polaris RZR on a trail riding trip and use it with my phone. Cheaper and easier than wiring a stereo in it. Very happy with this purchase! Like how the speaker is so portable.
Excellent
"first time i &#34;tried to attach&#34; the legs, the base broke into many sharp pieces resulting in a large cut in the palm of my hand"
"Excellent seller,  item meets the specifications"
It is too dark.  Cant even see through it.
Great product for on the go people.
I like it but the battery doest not last to much
I love the case it feels good in your hand it don't slip out and it  protects the phone nicely I have dropped my phone twice and it seems to hold up to no dings
"I was excited when I bought this because of the convenience.  However, the back of my phone (where tie iQi rests), gets very hot.  I decided not to use it because I don't want it to ruin my phone."
"Exactly as described, thank you"
"Product was not as described, further more the wrong one was sent, I would not recommend buying this product."
"These headphones really deliver! Being on the go all the time, having a durable, lightweight, and wireless headset was very high on my priority list. After doing some research, and reading the many positive reviews, I decided to try these Blimark Bluetooth earbuds, and I was very happy with my decision!<br /><br />After receiving them promptly, I was immediately impressed by the overall quality of the packaging and materials, and the sound was extremely impressive as well. Even though the bass is a bit subtle and perhaps not as deep as some over the ear or higher quality headsets, these earbuds still create the perfect undertones to those hot and heavy dance beats!<br /><br />They are excellent at noise cancellation as well, allowing the music to be super focused with the perfect level of sound. The comfortable fit allows them to fit snug and very close to your ear, making them great for working out, running, or even dancing. I have been using them for several weeks now, and I can honestly say that I will not be using any other kind for quite some time! If you’re looking to purchase a pair of great wireless headphones without breaking the bank, this is the set to get!"
Happy
"very protective, feels great, just a little bit heavy. very well made."
Great for travel!
Used it two weeks here in the US and a week in Germany. Worked just great.
Battery worked and was perfect size
I love this lil gadget.very accurate
Great love it my phone falls and it is great it doesn't even get a scratch
This is a good value and a nice set. My only complaint is I wish they were slightly easier to put in and secure for workouts. However I would recommend these to a friend as overall there really nice.
"Followed the instructions, destroyed my phone, cost me $400 to get a new phone. Bad idea! I have replaced screens on kindles successfully, don't use this kit."
Excellent
Stylus is slim and comfortable to hold/use. I recommend this product.
Works great at a great price.
"Fast shipping, and product was exactly as advertised."
Love this golf watch.  It has saved me strokes on every round.
"Great So Far. Snugg Fit, Stays Fit."
Tabs break easy
"Product shipped quickly. Nice looking case however like several other reviews mentioned, it does not fit snugly on the sides. Not sure if some fit and some don't but it was really annoying to have it fit so loosely."
This battery was not an original Samsung and caused the phone to turn off and on sporadically. I could not use it.
Came just as I expected.  It fit my phone unlike the last phone case I ordered it did not fit and is still sitting in the envelope it came in
"This is an awesome case to have, especially when you are on the beach or in the vacation.It is just what I wanted. I would still recommend to friends and family."
ok
This is not a really good case bz if u drop it...it break inside so i dont reccomend to get this case
"Does not work to transmit audio from a TV (or other item that has an earphone jack) to my iPhone 6+.  The seller was very helpful and after trying several steps, and communicating several times, accepted the return.  The seller's concern for customer satisfaction is exceptional."
"Love the iPhone 6 plus, this IPhone 6 Plus Belt Clip Holster case makes it too large to fit in my shirt pocket. (a convenience for me) I did use the belt holster for the Defender. So, I decided to sacrifice the protection for convenience and traded the cases for a more slim protective case and glass screen protector. Also love the High quality Faux-Leather pouch,Soft interior prevent scratches.

"I ordered this to replace my flex cable in my 5s after replacing the LCD and experiencing a re-boot loop problem.  I would disconnect the camera flex cable and the phone would boot up normally. So I ordered the replacement. Installed, the phone booted up fine. But when I would try to use the front facing camera the phone would freeze up and become very slow. Only showing a blur on the screen from the camera. So I pulled it back out and replaced it with the original. The original started working fine so I completed reassembly and left it alone. My phone works perfectly as it should.<br /><br />I did notice that the two cables are not identical. There is a piece of it that lays on the back of the LCD attached with adhesive like a sticker. The new one did not have this. It does not look the same but I gave it a shot anyways.<br />I didn't bother returning it, as I was glad that my phone was back to life. I toss it."
satisfied
What can I say?  It works.
Replaced following instructions on line.  Wireless very carefully.  However glass cracked one week after replaced.  Suspect glass was damaged by not to the eye.
"I have had this case on my phone for a few months and overall it's a really good quality case. I do drop my phone and this case has protected my phone and it hasn't cracked or anything. It does get scratched and gouged easily, but it is plastic so I guess that is to be expected. The thing that I'm currently experiencing is that the last time I dropped it, it got a gouge right where I hold it and it's fairly sharp. This is making it uncomfortable for me to hold so I'm going to try to file it down so I don't have to completely purchase a new case.<br />For the price this is a good case and it's really cute! I can charge my phone easily with it on as well. It reminds me of Kate Spade, but without the price!"
Nice
"The colors on the case are not as vivid as they appear online, it's more burgundy and green than red and silver.  That aside, the case is sturdy and the design is elegant.  It is a good compliment to my new phone."
"Stays on snug, lightweight, color accurate...."
"I purchased three different styles of the elago brand cases for my iPhone 6 at one time. Loved the color and slim fit, however it offered very little protection especially along the top and bottom of the case. Hard plastic and very smooth leaving no grip at all. Definitely would not trust it being protected if it was to be accidentally dropped."
meets my needs
Garbage
The magnetic clasp fell off in less than 24 hours of use. Super glued it back on. Been great ever since.
very nice for the price daughter and husband loved these. Very comfortable.
"This case is so cute! I love it.. only one small issue, the part that covers the power button was way too tight and it kept pushing in the button so i had to cut a small hole. Other than that, ots awesome! Fits like a glove"
Great!
"I just installed the 3rd of the three sheets that come in the pack. I replaced the first one at 6 months, and now just a few weeks down the road I had an accident that created a need for another replacement.  Each one has been as painless to install as any screen protector I have ever used.  They fit, and they come with little sticky tabs to remove the fuzz after install and eliminate bubbles.  I made the mistake of leaving my phone on the roof of my car, I realized at about 60 mph when I heard it slide off.  I stopped to pick it up from the middle of the road, and dreading the worst I flipped it over.  This screen protector was scuffed and torn to shreds, I peeled it off and had only a shallow scratch of less than 1/8th inch that had gone through.  I did have a &#34;light duty&#34; case on the phone with helped as well.  I may have been lucky in how it landed, but I certainly credit this product with helping save my screen from cracks or scratches.  I will be ordering another pack soon."
"Very pleased with these. I tend to break them, and lose them. So this price is great.  thank you"
This wallet/wristlet is wonderful. The magnet that holds the phone to the wallet is very strong. There are several credit card slots and enough room to hold more than one card. The leather is soft and it is very smooth. I love this wallet.
"Bought this for my husbands phone.  Love the cradle, but it's hard to snap in and out.  I figure it will loosen with time.  Had my iPhone in the same  case and slipped in a pool of mud (in the dark).  The phone went in the mud and it was totally protected, especially at the bottom.  That sold me."
I love it
;)
High quality knock-off.  Why not pay less for more?
Excellent product. Recommended!
The case broke after a week.
"The case does just what is says it will do.  I use it all the time when outdoors gardening and boating. I can operate the iPhone very well while it is inside the case and even take and make phone calls. It isn't water resistant when you're wearing headphones because the headphone cord keeps you from closing the seal tight.  My one reservation is the lanyard. I like it because my iPhone doesn't fall out of my pocket when I bend down. However the phone swings around on the lanyard and get's in the way. I have to tuck the phone into my belt or pin the lanyard to my shirt to keep the phone from swinging around on the lanyard.  I recommend this product, especially for people who spend a lot of time outside."
Really Really Cheap quality misleading pictures  broke after 2 weeks and the battery was hell
I have used for over 3 months.  It works very well great picture.  You will need a high capacity SD card
I recommend excellent product . All very good
Heavy Duty!<br /><br />Pros:<br />My phone is now armored like a sherman tank<br />All ports are well covered to keep out dust<br />edges and backing are made of an awesome rubber shock absorber<br />Cornings gorilla glass of the front cover<br />bolts together with small alan head<br />comes with two tools and extra bolts<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very Heavy<br />Large foot print<br />charging port is hard to gain access (using apple brand chargers and its still a squeeze)<br />camera/home button not covered<br />alan head tool that came with phone started to strip
Blocks part of the screen from being used or viewed
Awesome to not worry about my phone going dead for 4 days!
"Item came in the scheduled amount of time and has worked well for me. I can see where the armband would be small for people with bigger arms. My biceps are about 16 inches around and it fits nicely, but people with arms a little bigger than that may have trouble with the product fitting. That being said, I have no complaints or any problems with the product."
"The box is amazing 2.0 charging is perfect , but the cable , not so much. After the first 2 days , so 2-4 charges in , it stopped fitting into my phone. It fits in , but falls right out , as if what should be holding it into place broke. I really want to blame my phone , mostly do , but still the durability factor of the cable isn't the best. So for the box 5/5 , cable 2/5"
"With this mount & Filmic Pro running on my iPhone 6 plus, I now have another great camera added to my gear.  Great mount holds the phone snug.  Would buy again.  Thanks for making it!"
Does what it says!
"I recently bought a refurbished iPhone, which came without a charging cable. I got this one to use instead. I have to say that I am thoroughly happy with the cord. It fits the slot perfectly. I can &#34;find&#34; the phone by pulling on the cord, which I do as little as possible because I'm sure it's not great for the cord and/or the phone. The phone charges in just about the same amount of time as my daughter's iPhone, which came with the original manufacturer cable. The last reason why I am so happy over a simple cord is that it is the exact same color as my phone. I know that's a silly reason, but I have several items charging from that outlet, and having them color-coded makes life just a little easier.<br /><br />For those reasons, plus the fact that I see my little iPhone and its matching cable and it makes me smile, I give this five stars."
Nothing like I expected. The case is so bootleg
Does what it does
"Love it, good fingerprint access and buttons work correctly."
Best idea I had to up my iPhone photography game. Love how the wide screen expands the view of the camera and how this allows for all lenses to work with both the front and back camera. Great quality.
Did not fit my iPad ... Not even close! So disappointed!
"Great Product, easy to use and sounds great. Would buy again."
Love the case and the color match is perfect
Clip fell off the device the second day and was lost. So disappointed to have wasted money for one day.
Great product. I have it for many different devices.
Too loose for iphone 5s
"This portable charger is very good. It charges up my iPhone 6 to full really fast and keeps it running on my long journey from work each day. Otherwise the journey on public transportation would be hell without my phone and this Superpak keeps the power flowing.  The quality of the product is nice and durable. I've dropped it a couple times and noting broke; it keeps on working. The white color is fantastic with my iPhone and other accessories.  The small size and awesome  charging capability is why I really like this device. It doesn't take up much room in my purse and how light it is, I don't even notice it there.  I received this product from UNU's review program in exchange for my honest review."
This is a fantastic product and I would recommend it to everyone.  I recieved a promo code for a fair review
Good
"OK guys, get out your rulers again.  This is not a 6&#34; fan.  Overall frame is 4-3/4 inches square x 1 inch deep.  Fan blade diameter is 4-3/8 inches."
Got for my wife. We really like to take care of our phones. Does what it's supposed to do. Good product.
"Initially, I actually really liked this light. The light is bright enough to see what you're doing pretty well in the dark. It holds a lot of charge...After the initial charging, it charged my iPhone maybe 5 or 6 times. It seems to register solar light quite easily (not sure how quickly solar light charges it...I've only charged it from the outlet so far).<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it totally messed up my iPhone battery. My battery used to last for about two days on a full charge. Now, it can barely make it through one day without me having to charge it again. This happened after charging my phone on it maybe 2 times and I could tell there was a big difference in battery life. On top of that, I can't get the battery pack on the light to recharge all the way now. I've had it plugged in now for over 24 hours and it still says it is only half way charged. I think this light will still be useful to have, but I'm upset that my iPhone seems to have been permanently damaged."
I ordered one and it didn't work BUT RAVPower was so great about the whole experience and I couldn't be happier with the product I have now.  Recommend.
"Battery was alright for two weeks, then quickly dropped charge.  Now useless."
Better than wat I imagined
works
"Works seamlessly, no issues, overall pretty good."
This is a great case.  I love that it is fully enclosed with a built-in screen protector.  No problems with tactile sensitivity or anything else on the screen after almost 2 months of using it.  Protects really well and is a very nice looking case.
Thanks  I love it
"As someone already mentioned, this case is so slim and matches the gold color of my gold Edge+ so perfectly that it's difficult to tell that it even has a case on it.  Well done!"
Great cords
"It gets kind of blurry on the edges of the picture when I use the wide range lens but I didn't expect it to be 100% perfect given its not that expensive.  Overall, I really like the product. I would definitely recommend it."
VERY GOOD!
Worth more than the price!!!! It is very protective and its a cute pink color. Definetly ordering more.
Fast shipping & Great Item
Great value. Quick delivery.
great
Good phone
"Due to over 30% of the bad reviews, I was really worried if I made the wrong decision on getting UP2. However, I really like the design of UP2, small, light weight, comfortable to wear and the features (include the app), which helps me to watch my daily activities and hit my exercise goals. Many people complained it does not stay on the wrist well, but mine hasn't had this problem yet. Only one thing needs to be aware, but not a big deal, it sync with my phone every few minutes,so drains the battery really fast. In overall, it is a good tracker worth to give it a try!"
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
Color of the band is different from the color of the grey Apple Watch (more reddish). The tool for band length adjustment is too weak to push out the pin from the link to remove it - need to bring to a watch shop for adjustment.
"Works as a replacement iPhone 5S home button.  Remember, there will be no itouch after you replace the button.  The process to replace the buttom is fairly straight forward and easy.  Just check out all the youtube videos.  This came safety packaged"
Very good amplifier!!!!!! My Vette now is rocking!!!! Very easy to install and very fast shipping!!!!
"I originally purchased a black one for my Samsung Galaxy Note Edge based on my experience with the one I had for my prior cell phone. I loved it some much, I purchased a brown one. My requirements were that it had to be slim, protect the phone from scratches, easy to access, attractive and offer a way to carry it in & around the straps of various size pocketbooks. The pouch has 2 different loops for attaching it to a belt, purse or around the neck and came with a ring and a long string. Unfortunately, neither of these items work very well, at least for me. So I bought a foot of  small link chain from Home Depot , strung it through the inside loop opening and closed the ends with a ring used to hold keys. Now I can slide one end of the chain off and attach the pouch around the straps of different purses. With the small loop on the back, I attached a  3&#34; belt ring to hang it around larger straps or briefcases.  If, in the future I want to carry the phone on my body, I would buy a longer length of chain along with jewelry clasps and hang it across my body or on my shoulder. And finally, it fits nice and slim inside a larger purse just buy itself."
Thanks
love it
good
Worked perfectly.
"I don't think it lives up to its hype. About one third of the calls are not clear enough to hear. I have to shut the ear piece off, or call back the person that called me."
The worst Bluetooth ever. Wouldn't charge fully. Battery sucks. Noisy.
"The fit is perfect, and so far I have only used one. I would highly suggest this for anyoje looking."
Love it! I'm It could store 3 cards max
"This pouch clips securely onto my belt with no problems at all. You can even run your belt thru the extra belt loops for added security. I have no issue removing my phone from this pouch or putting it back in. Some reviews say the naked iPhone is too big for this pouch, which is true, but it clearly says on the description of this product that you need a defender or commuter case. I have a Speck case on my 5s with a little wiggle room inside the pouch, but it's not a deal breaker for me. Good product, buy it."
"Works well, but sound is soft. Very easy to use."
This is a great case to organize all my traveling electronic accessories.
Works great!
"Bought it for my girlfriend and she uses it all the time, looks nice on her phone."
"First let me say that the product works as advertised. Haven't had a problem with it since I received it.  The package came in two days. already impressed.  The product is right on spot when it comes to the description; adds grip to your phone, it's a snug fit, and a clear case for you to still appreciate the appearance of your Moto G (3rd generation) especially if you have used the Motorola website to customize the look of your phone.  *I have posted photos for reference: -The Cut out for the headphone port and microphone (found at the top of your phone) & the charging port (found at the bottom of your phone) are big enough so you won't have any problems using a 3rd party cable.  -there is a &#34;lay on the table&#34; feature so you can place your phone on a table with the screen faced down without scratching it. I would still recommend a screen protector for more protection.  -speaking of protection, this is a silicon based case, meaning your phone will most likely be protected from scratches and light bumps, not drops.  the only con I have with this is that the power and volume buttons are also covered as supposed to an open cut out so they are a bit hard to press. not a deal breaker though.  Overall, I like this case, and for the price; you really can't go wrong.  Highly recommended."
I am very pleased with my order it was more than I expected and fast delivery!!!
"I haven't used it yet, but it feels extremely sticky to me and am hoping it won't leave a gummy mess on my dash."
Love it!!! I take it everywhere I go!!!
Love it! My phone is charging faster plus it doubles as a micro to std USB chord.
"Great case. After spending over $20 for a crappy Spigen case, This is much better and looks cool too. I will buy another one for myself"
"Bought 2 of these as they work very well. If/when I lose or put it through the washing machine, I'll repurchase the same one again."
"This is a great screen protector as it nicely fits the face of the phone, without interfering with the curved edge of the S6. I also like the provided back cover as it will cover the back of the phone from minor scratches etc even though the phone will be in a case all the time."
Love it great protection
"In June we bought our KDLinks X1 Full-HD camera and we are so happy with it. Very good image quality, easily to set it up and to use. The mounting unit, windshield suction cup, is really great very easy to mount. We are ordering the second unit."
Its great!
I liked so much it's very cute and received on good time
Works well
"Great Product, speedy delivery, NO PROBLEMS!"
It works! Love it.
Pretty good value for money
Work much better than my expectations. My Garmin Nuvi 65LM fit perfectly in the center of the Nav-Mat and stay secure in the correct position.
Great quality cables very sturdy wish they were a bit longer but they are excellent for the price.
Best phone case I've ever had
"Did not work consistently, had to hold in place just to charge, then stopped working all together after 4 days,"
great quality
"Very easy to put on, really like the life  Time warranty"
"After suffering the vagaries of cheap aftermarket cables, I decided to go with the Honeywell brand (having used their industrial products).  This thing died in less than 6 weeks. Figuring out how to contact these people to demand a replacement.  Disappointed."
"My items has stopped working after day 4. I reset, and reset, and deleted app, and reset and charged, and blah blah. It won't syn the correct time anymore. It will count steps but I won't sync with my iPhone 5. I was excited for something so cheap! BUT I got what I paid for. :("
I  like it
This phone case is what's up. I've already got multiple compliments on it.
excellent product! A++++++
I love my California case it's cute and fits my phone perfectly! Thank you!!
does not work  will take it up with the seller.
"It awakened me to the ease of using my Kindle, which I use frequently daily, and this product is easy, foldable to take along, and easy to use, I love it."
These head phones sucked wouldn't pair and if they did the sound was crap
Great case
I love my Tempe for camping trips. Hook this up to your backpack or hang it outside / in the tent / wherever and you'll get much more accurate temperature logs than you do with a watch on your wrist. If your very interested in tracking temperature while out in the wild and still want to huddle down in your sleeping bag while you check the temperature outside this is worth it.
"I like the weight and the length, but it sometimes takes several taps for my tablet to react.  My older fat tip m-edge stylus had no issues.<br />I'll keep these because I like the smaller tip, but I'm disappointed with the function."
Great sound quality and comfortable
"Cute & fun, easy to match with"
"Shipped vacuum sealed without desiccant.  6 of the 12 colors had multiple breaks in them.  They did not ship all the colors shown in the photo.<br />I have only used the filament to add a touch of color here and there in my e3d hotend, and it prints just fine.<br /><br />See attached picture to see what colors did come in.  I even arranged them in the same orientation and put the extra colors off to the side."
"Not a bad product,  I love the fact that it can just be worn as a accessory, and if not just clipped to bag straps.  Charge time is fairly good,  gets a little warm when charging though. lives up to the 3000mah capacity. The way it's designed however has one minor flaw in that if you wear it,  the area around the port cover kind of bends to conform with the wrist and creates little spaces where water might get into.<br />Overall still love  the product.  Would definitely be recommending it."
I hate this case it was great at first then it got a big bubble and all the water evaporated and now all my sparkles and stars are stuck.
Excellent product. Flawless installation. Especially appreciate the bubble removing squeegee.
Great addition to a techie family car!  Works GREAT for the whole family.
"This product works very well. For me, Choetech products have always worked well for me. After trying several other brands, I always come back to this brand. Have not had issues to date."
"Just got this for my new phone. I'm an absolute clutz as I usually try to carry or do far more than I have hands for. Didn't have this on my phone for but two days when the phone slipped out off my pocket as I was carrying groceries and landed on the sidewalk corner first. Cannot even see where it hit the concrete.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Slim case.<br />Great price<br /><br />Cons:<br />Have had it just a week or so, the color is already getting dingy. But for the price, it's doing its intended job quite well.<br /><br />So far so good."
Works fine
Great charging base. Works well and is easy to sit phone on and charge. Some other bases are much more finicky about getting the phone in the exact position before they start charging. This one is easy.
Lost one of my original tips on the way to the gym a few days ago.  These are exactly like the originals that came with my headphones and fit great.
"Took a little patience to get the screen off, but this $15 investment was so much easier than spending over $100! !!!! Took about 15 minutes tops"
Very good price.  Has excellent touch response and very clear.
Advertised to be an LG G3 But it was not.<br />Very disappointed and then they wanted me to text them in England to make arrangements to send it back.<br />I am not wasting my money on these people ever again.
"Great coating for screen,  doesn't interfere with phones typing /swiping functions."
goodjob!
Lasted only 4 months and now will not charge.  Doesn't have a warrant or anything.  You would think electronic's would have a 1 year warranty.<br />I have always trusted Plantronics equipment.
"Works great.<br /><br />Word to the wise, Amazon is full of &#34;genuine samsung&#34; batteries that are fakes.  Nobody is going to fake an Anker brand battery, so you are much better off with this.  It works at least as well, if not better, than the original battery when it was new.  Fits perfectly too."
It only works for a few months but you can't beat the price!
Thank you for the 2-year warranty on my CD player.
Pros: The case was easy to install and fits my iPhone 6 great and I love the color. The screen proctor goes on with fairly easy with just a little effort to get all the air bubbles out. Cons: the back of the case is very slick and easily slides out of your hand especially when using the phone one handed. The port to access the silence mode on and off switch on the side of the case is quite deep and somewhat difficult to reach and operate especially if you do not have long finger nails. I have not dropped the phone in the case to test its durability but over all it's a decent case for the price range it is in.
Just what I ordered. Good quality and came the next day.
Works
yuk
A very useful product. I take it with me when I travel and it charges all my electronic devices.
"I'm fine with this cable being a little on the heavy side, and not really wrapping up as nicely as the other &#34;regular&#34; cables.  I'll trade the portability for something that's going to last.  But this didn't last.  After only a handful of uses (4), the Lightning connector broke right off in my phone.  Luckily, I keep a multi-tool in the car, and was able to get it out.<br />These cables aren't cheap, and I was hoping this would be the last one I'd have to buy.  The regular Apple and Belkin cables lasted much longer than these.<br />Very disappointed.<br />****UPDATE****<br />Okay, I have to say their customer service is great!  They explained the situation to me, and replaced both of my cables (only one broke so far, but they replaced both just in case the other one broke) and explained the situation to me.  It seems that there was a fault in the initial production run that caused the breakage, but that's all worked out, and the updated product works as it should.<br />I'm giving this 5 stars now, because they obviously care about their products and want to ensure that they stand behind them.  They've gone above and beyond to make sure things are right, and I appreciate that.<br />I'll update this review if I find anything worthy of an update, but I'm very happy with this cable so far.<br />Love it!"
"Works great! Didn't end up keeping it because I found it pointless, but it's a cool product for the right people."
"replaced a older garmin with this one , lifetime free updates and works perfectly"
"Having upgraded from a Blu Dash 3.5, I was disappointing in the quality of this product.<br /><br />The camera's quality is that of some first generation digital camera.  This phone's camera is not even as good as the years old one I upgraded from.  The power connection is off kilter resulting in having to place the cable in on a forward angle and pressing backwards before pushing it in.  Even when pushed in, you have to make look carefully to ensure it's actually charging.  The sound quality from the headphones is just poor, low volume and a slight tinny sound it it.  Even using my own quality earbuds, the audio quality just isn't there.  The power on button is recessed a bit too far back into the case making difficult for all but petite fingers to use.  I have opened the case and wiggled it when closing in hopes that its just a misaligned board to case, but it appears the assembled parts are made this way.<br /><br />As a smartphone, it has all the features and systems in place that one needs.  It is, however, an introductory product for someone who just isn't into the need for quality images and audio, this is great for the price.  It seems a little ironic that a product with the name &#34;Studio&#34; in it failed at studio items.  The Blu Dash series from several years ago still out performed the &#34;studio&#34; aspect (sound and images) of this product.  Hopefully I just got the one inferior quality item and my results are not what other's will have."
Nicely made case. Fits perfect.
"Made cheap,looks cheap...will never use"
Awesome
works perfect will charge or transfer data to an IPhone or IPad
"So far so good, had it on now for a few weeks and no issues. Keep my phone in my pocket and it isn't collecting dust or anything.  It is rather tight fitting, so getting it onto the phone was a bit tricky.  It actually sent my phone into recovery mode cause it was pressing buttons down while I stretched it on."
"Great! This stand is sturdy and does exactly what I need it to do. Fits my iPad Air 2, and my iPhone 6+ even in an Otterbox case. I use it mainly to hold my phone landscapewise at night as an alarm clock. 10/10 would buy again."
"Purchased July 15, 2015 fell apart August 28, 2015.  Not a good value purchase."
"I have been really happy with this so far.  Great deal.  Good sound quality, comfortable, easy to set up.  Most earphones pop out of my ears that that has happened a few times while working out here, but i'm getting the feel of how to twist them into my ears."
"At first look it just looks like a regular phone case, but then when you look at it closer you notice that there is a place for your cards<br /><br />I'm able to hold 3 credit cards and a folded up bill in it.<br /><br />Does what it needs to do!"
I refuse to give this item a rating I followed every step and this item doesn't work so don't waste your money
Works as well as original
My mom loves them since they orange and uses them everyday
"I like the minimal covers for my smart phones as I usually baby my phones and have not had too many accidents so far.  I am absolutely delighted with this cover from Otterbox and can't believe I have waited so long to get this for my iPhone 5.  I like the raised edge that protects the face of my phone.  Best of all, mine says &#34;Made in USA&#34; on the inside...can't believe the packaging didn't mention this.  None of the exterior buttons take unexpected pressure to activate the phone, volume, etc.  Very pleased with this cover and will get another when I update my smartphone choice later this fall."
Poorly made
Wonderful product! Works well
Great piece of gear. It is sleek and very well built. I managed to fully charge my Macbook 2015 with this thing. Impressive!
Great sound quality
"its good, but heavy. so like if you're going on a trip its helpful, but not carrying it along in the shopping mall."
Not sticking properly to the mobile on cleaned mobile surface.
This case is sturdy yet sleek and not bulky. It is not slippery to hold due to a slightly rubberized texture. I'm a pink lover but it comes in many color- masculine and feminine.  The gorilla glass has a tutorial to show how to apply it properly. It's better than a plastic film- it looks like the actual screen and is perfectly responsive to touch. Good value too! Well pleased!!!
"After receiving a replacement for a defective part,  it works perfect! Great quality and fantastic customer attentiveness."
Great product!! It's very convenient to have my phone and wallet in one place.
AWESOME fits BLU LIFE VIEW phone 5.2inch screen
excellent product
Very nice i iwll buy it again.
We use this on our end table daily. Works great.
"I purchased this item because it looked like another great way to consolidate my ridiculous charging needs.  We have a lot of Apple products in our home and we're always shuffling the chargers and stands.  This stand is nice because it provides an option for you to rest your iPhone as well.  Please realize that it does not charge the phone, but it will hold it.  The stand is not an actual charger either, but rather a device that holds the iWatch cable that comes with the iWatch.<br /><br /> It is designed specifically for the iWatch because the location for the charging cable is round, just as the watch charger is.  The round piece fits in the top of the stand and the cord winds down the interior of the stand (out of view).  There are grooves to fit the cord in.  It gives you the ability to shorten and lengthen it as needed.<br /><br />This is a good deal as it is 1/3 less in price than similarly designed items, but still has the solid quality.<br /><br />The bottom has decent sized non-skid pads.  I took a photo of the bottom so that you can see the size.  I find that many electronic device stands are stingy on the rubber pads, but this one has enough to hold it in place well!<br /><br />I have received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. With the intention of helping potential consumers make a more informed purchase decision. No other form of compensation took place."
My reliable travel companion
love it
"Purchased JETech Bluetooth headset believing it to be \\""noise canceling\\"", but got a headset that had volume control issues, an ear piece that was very uncomfortable to wear more than two hours. The tech who designed this should go back and start all over again."
Love it....it's small & very sturdy and holds my cell phone perfectly
"This is my second otterbox case that I've owned, I work in the railroad industry and need a tough case. Well unfortunately I dropped my phone and belt clip about 5 feet order the ground and the phone popped out of the clip and a corner of the chipped off and now the phone falls out of the clip constantly. No damage to my phone that I noticed but it did it's job."
This was just an iPhone part
Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
Love them!
"Excellent quality and design rolled into a secure case that looks good too!  I really enjoyed the ease in which the case could be assembled/disassembled, but still felt very secure in how it fit together.  I feels like complete protection from the built in screen protector to the built in port covers, this case provide a very good amount of protection for the average iPhone 5 user.    After just a couple of days of my using it, my 17 year old daughter pursuing me so much for the cover that I finally gave it up to her to test.  She loved it the customization covers and, surprisingly, her biggest excitement was that the Apple logo shown through the rear of the case!  She said it added a little bit to the size of the phone, but after an hour or so she couldn't imagine her phone without the case - and this coming from a 17 year old girl!   Great design, excellent quality and customization.  What else do you need?!?!"
"The case is exactly as described and show! The color is so cute and the back is clear enough. The lettering on the back of my phone is readable. I would recommend to anyone. It protects well, but is hard to get off."
Nice screen protectors at a great price
"amazing cell phone protector, we don't understand the science, but it totally protects the screen,  We put these phone guards on with the eCo-covers [[ASIN:B011324P18 The BPA-Free iPhone 6 eCo-cover includes IPG Invisible Phone Guard for free!]],  and no longer have to worry about breaking our phones or screens."
"Fit the phone, made it water proof, just caused a lot of problems with the camera, looked like you were taking a photo in a tunnel. It inhibited the accuracy of the touch screen as well. Just not real happy with the case."
It cuts in out when I'm talking people.
Works great! Been using a couple weeks now and nice and clear!
I love this case! It fits my phone perfectly and I love the bling! Also have to say that I rec'd my order very fast. I will order again in the future.
"I have had it quite a while and the image still looks great.  Though covered, I have not had any trouble using the buttons."
Very good.
Very good
it was great at first but it only lasted a few months.I should have expected this from the price.
"For me the effect seems more obvious with the wake-up energize sequence than with the calming effect. I have primarily used it for the mid-morning slump and afternoon slump, however, it won't counteract a true sleep deficit."
Very happy with my purchase.
Great product. I recommend it to anyone needing a portable charger for phone or other electronic device!
"Nice 200 watt marine head unit with FM, AM, WB aux in and a USB port. Dose NOT have a CD player and that is okay for me. The weather band is a very handy feature to have, I am surprised that more marine stereos don't come with it. I bought this to replace a Clarion M235 and it sounds way better. I have this radio hooked up to four  5.4&#34; Blaupunkt MSx542 marine speakers and they sound great together."
It was the wrong one. It didn't fit
"love it, loved the color and the feel"
"Well made, durable, excellent buy, and excellent seller to do business with."
this arrived defective - one of the channels was not working and created extremely loud feedback. by the time this was determined Amazon would not allow me to return it.
Really cute wish it was a silver chain but still a cute black phone case wristlet
"Love it!  Made for display and not for protection.  But, I knew that going in.  Was worried it would be the 'ND' instead of the Fighting Sioux logo, but it is exactly as pictured for the Galaxy Note 4.  Well definitely have it going during hockey season!"
This is the second jackery bar I purchased. I bought one previously for myself. This was a gift and they loved it!
Broke after 1 wk
Long enough to plug in my cell phone and still have mobility
This works great....
Works great!
Best phone ever!!!!
"Works great feels good in my hand, it has a tight fit that keeps its profile low, which is great for such a large phone, can barley feel the difference of no case and this one in my pocket. Have dropped it once or twice and it has done its job so far. I would say it was a great deal for a good product!"
This is a terrible product. It does what it says but poorly. Anything played back thru it is nothing but static.
Great fit and slim.  Offers ample protection.
"This works great, I bought one from the cell store for $25 for my Samsung S5 and this is every bit as good.  I was a bit nervous installing myself, but was easy to do.  So far no air bubble issues after 3 weeks of use, will update if there are future issues.  The Tempered Glass is a MUST for cell phones."
Protects the phone as much as a bumper case can;  feels & looks great!
"perfect fit, easy install, exactly like the stock one.  overpriced for what it is but whos gonna bother to send you anything for less than $5"
"I love this case. It's durable, sleek, and not too big. Highly recommend. Great for the price."
love  this  i  fixed my  cell phone myself  with the  help  of  U-tube  saved alot  of money  couldnt believe how  easy this  was  to  do
"I am disappointed, frustrated, and upset!  I watched the getting started videos repeatedly and had no trouble syncing the Myo.  However, it has not responded to any of the gestures. I am hugely disappointed because I ordered it to wow the audience for a major presentation. It is totally useless! I contacted tech support via email as there is no phone number and they were super slow to respond and still have not offered to troubleshoot or information on returning it!!!!! The Myo and tech support in my experience was an epic failure! Until they get the kinks out and provide better tech support, buy a traditional presentation remote and save your money."
Love it
"love it-- sturdy and really cute. wish there was someway to attach a wrist strap. with drivers license and credit cards in case, sometimes, that's all I need."
JYZ Thank you so much. I love this case. Omg it feels really good in the hand and the purple color just pops. I made a good choice and the seller was quick with shipping. Over all I'm happy with my case. Also the leather is so shiny. Love it.
Great
I liked it but bad quality. I used for 2 week and it broke so easily
"Perfect fit, Easy to apply, Quick shipment"
"Really good case!  Dropped my 5S several times, and not a single scratch!  Looks nice and sleek too, being all black."
Bulky but that is what you expect if you want the phone to be perfectly safe. No problems at all writing emails with the plastic cover. Nicely done by OtterBox.
Great
"i just got the charger from the mail. i would like to say it works great and very portable. unbiased opinion this is the best portable station i ever got,"
I tried 2 other S5 flip cases with a spot to put my driver's license and they both broke in a few days.  My BUDDIBOX is now 2 years old and going strong.  I have dropped my phone several times and it never gets damaged. The BUDDIBOX is the BEST protection ever for my Samsung S5.  I purchased 2 more BUDDIBOXs for family members phones and they love them!
Fits my phone great and can hold some bills and my ID and credit card.  I just wish it had a wrist strap and it would be perfect!
"Fantastic little speaker. I didn't have high expectations for the speaker, but was pleasantly surprised. This speaker does exactly what I wanted it to do. Awesome product at such a fair price. We enjoy leaving one in different rooms for convenience. Very easy to use too!"
I like the fact you can charge two phones at once I also like the color on this so you know it's yours this is a charger I will always keep with me to save time.PS. I need a few more great gifts
It's very cute although it's extremly slippery. I ordered it a month ago and it's still not here.
The case itself would be great if it would fit properly and if it didn't have excess platick around the edges wich is sharp and is not suppose to be their.... Every case needs to be checked to make sure its made right because mine was just horrible..  Would not recommend this product
Nifty little product!
"The worst case ever , don't  buy it don't feet the phone."
"I believe this phone has what I have been looking for. It's super affordable and feels durable and hasn't caused any problems for the couple of months that I have owned it. For the price versus the specs, this phone is by far worth it and every peeny involved."
Started to tear the first time I used it.
I love it.
Nice price.  Works as described.
"Doesn't have the range of other Bluetooth adapters, but it's portability makes it worth it"
This is my second purchase. The product still working out great like the first set.
"Shipped quickly, very good quality.  Extra long cord makes it easy to use my device while it's charging.  My charging time is shortened a lot!  Highly recommend!!!"
"I feel a little safe, with is case"
"What do I like about this product: • It is compact and light • It can be paired easily with my smartphone • It has crystal clear sound • The buttons are located on the blue tooth headsets which takes a little time to get used to but once I knew how to use them, it is very easy • It can go 4-5 hours without charging. USB cable to charge is included with this product. • After using it for some time, I forgot that I had the headset in my ears.  Additional Information: It comes with Bluetooth headset, USB charger, USB earphones (for the other ear) and ear hook.  Overall opinion: Very good  Sample received from seller in exchange of honest and unbiased review."
Works well. Just used it on trip from Chicago to Milwaukee to Green Bay and back - no problems!
great
Everything was perfect
Forms worship to foreign countries to members of the family at this present time there was no feedback about any one of the phones are is not working so all phones are ok 4-star rating
Wish there were more protectors in the package so when I can't seem to get it on right the first time I could try again... but it does its job... It seems that though when looking from the top and bottom the screen can still be seen so the 45° angle of privacy only works for the sides that doesn't give full privacy for me it seems there could be that tall person looking down at the phone that would be able to see what's going on if that makes sense... but other than that can't complain
great buy super fast shipping a+++
Works great
"These inexpensive cables work fine and feel like good quality.  The packaging is a step up from a blister pack or cheap box, and has some nice notes and thank yous for purchasing the product.  Just opening the box gave me a feeling of quality."
☺
nice
Arrived in original packaging and way ahead of schedule. Haven't used it because it's a (sentimental) backup.
Boyfriend loves it
This Bluetooth car speaker sucks! I had it turned all the way up and I still couldn't hear the caller. This was a really big disappointment. I know that the thing is capable of being louder because the voice that announces connection is loud and clear. It is impossible to hear the caller at any volume level. I definitely learned my lesson about buying no name brands.
"I did receive item in a timely fashion, but when I went to check connections for the third time with correct wiring, it didn't even turn on. I hear great reviews about it... I guess im just one of the few..."
Too much hissing
"Efficient, while not the nicest design. But the &#34;excess&#34; in texture and decoration makes it easier to grasp, TBT..."
"I received these a week ago and after wearing one of them for 2 days it broke. I'm wearing a different one now, and it is cracked."
It works also and love it very much
"Nice solid case, would recommend.  Comes with a screen protector as well."
bien
We use them as cat toys because they bounce around and the cat loves them.
"Great cover, dropped my phone from around 3ft 3 times so far and not a single problem.  All buttons and holes line up perfectly with 100% of screen viewable.  Backing has minor gripping compared to all metal or plastic cases."
"Returned.  It doesn't pair well.  It pairs.  However, I took it once and try to pair with my friend's phone.  It won't pair.  We ended up not taking the selfie.  :("
Seemed to work ok till the clip broke after about the 4th or 5th charge
fast shipping . looks like picture
Very nice!!! My son love it😀
I love how this case looks! It is super lightweight does not add any bulk or weight to my phone.  That being said I do not think it offers very much protection either.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
Very good
I got wrong  one
Worked very well.  Ocean boating was a breeze.
Does not stay in place firmly. Bolts/Screws loosen up after time (I've had it for about one month now)
I received the 4th car charger today and it is the same one as the 3rd and does not work. I will now ask for a refund and try getting the nuvi 200 car charger from another dealer.  Very disappointed in this item.
Its ok...for the first time
Excellent quality.  I like that the length is very long so I can watch TV way across the<br />room with my headphones. Thank you.
Product was and still is perfect comea in a couple days as informed all in all a perfect buy it charges my phone at least 4 times from 0% to 100 i have a galaxy
Purchased this to replace the factory charger that was misplaced. Works great!
My husband loves it. No complains. Charges his cell.
"Bought it as a replacement for a 928 w/cracked screen.  Since it is not on a verizon network, the hotspot does not work.  Everything else works as expected with my Ting SIM card."
"It is light, pretty and durable"
Works fantastic!!
Fit great! Looks factory
"Received this phone the other day and it's exactly what I needed.  It is a refurbished phone but it's in excellent condition.  No scratches or visible sign of use.  Came in original box with all necessary accessories.  All I had to do was slip my already owned and active AT&T sim card (from a broken phone I was replacing with this one) into the slot and voila!  Back to business as usual.  Didn't need to contact AT&T, unlock or register anything online, etc.  It just works period.  And is set for service in the United States,  east coast to be specific.  Thanks for excellent service and a perfect product. Please be advised that you may want to double check but I'm almost positive that this phone will only work with an AT&T plan and not T-MOBILE.   I was told that the Skyrocket version of the Galaxy S2 was exclusive to AT&T.  I am confident that it will 100% work great on AT&T networks but if you have any other cell carriers call them first and ask if the Skyrocket can be activated on their network.   I'm pretty sure the answer is no. Hope this helps anyone interested. =)"
Great product !!
Great wallet Will buy again
I wish I would have bought 2 of these now. It charges quickly and I get 3-4 phone charges from it.
Excellent product. Works great. It's very easy to place my phone on the magnet and it hold very well.
"I received my Asus as promised, when I turned on the phone for the first time, TALKBACK -ACCESSIBILITY was annoying as HELL. This accebility should be disable before shipping.  Battery life not so great for the price i can't complaint.  Still testing...."
"Bery good, last longer than the original"
"Perfect fit for the Samsung 1900. This also fits the 1700, this is my secind one and worth the price."
My daughter loves this selfie stick.  She had purchased a much cheaper one and it did not work very well.  This selfie stick has a solid feel and seems very sturdy.  The clamps appear very secure.  The blue tooth paired with her iPhone very easily and quickly.
a
it did not hold and stay attached to my phone...useless. had to send it back. i have an android maxx
It works awesome. No other power backups cannot compete with this in terms of both cost and quality. I recommend buying this.
Counterfeit- not a real Kate Spade case. The design on the back is a sticker. The case is inferior quality and shipped directly from China.<br />Caveat Emptor!
After a month the suction spring stop working which for a $65 dock is unacceptable .
My son loves this case.  Shipping was very fast.
These were perfect for my Galaxy S5 cell phone. Very beautiful with bling on the back. Fits perfect and very attractive. Very reasonably priced too!  I like the protection they give my phone.
I love this iPhone wallet . Works perfectly!
Very happy with this case and the service. Exactly what I was looking for and description was accurate. Arrived on time.
great case
I like the color and everything
Actually really pleasantly suprised for the price!! Really cute design and seems secure.
"It has an amazing battery life, I can use it while I charge it, and as long as I leave my phone's bluetooth on, I just turn it on and it automatically connects."
"cheaply made, the &#34;crystal scratched from gently wiping it with a clean t-shirt."
Works great! Excellent price!
Great case! Fits nicely on my Space gray iPhone 6 (4.7) and the cut outs for all the plugs and cables fit well. My only complaint is that casemate cases aren't necessarily worth 18-25 dollars but it seems to be pretty durable quality. My cat likes it too.
Would not work in my 2013 Lincoln MKZ. The vent vains are to wide...
Wire popped out of the casing within 2 weeks.  Poor quality.
Fits and looks good.
This case is very sleek.. Met my expectation !!
Great product fast delivery
Easy to apply; no bubbles. I did feel that it was a little more reflective (slight glare) than other tempered glass products I have used.
As advertised.
This is the 2nd of this style dash mount. Works best for us and our vehicles. Minnesota State law does not allow us to attach items such as gps or radar detectors to the windshield directly (VERY STUPID LAW). This makes the unit secure and we are able to lower it to the floor to help hide it so our car is less likely to be broken into.
Great durable case.
"I love,very privacy,no body,see,my screen,1000% recomended,"
"It's pretty cool, very nice, love it."
Very stylish. Waterproof. Everything works and is pretty comfortable. If you have a large wrist it may not be big enough. I'm 6'2&#34; 240 lbs. And i am on the second last hole on the band
The charger surpasses the manufacturers claims of power and ease of use it works for all of my Samsung Galaxy  products plus my Toshiba Satellite laptop. I would recommend this product and brand to anyone looking for the extra security of a backup power source for my mobile devices.
Works for me
Repeat purchase.  Works great.
OK
My son loved it! The only bad thing about it is that the battery runs out too fast.
Great case! Just wish it had it's own magnet to automatically turn phone on/off upon opening/closing. Otherwise it works perfectly for what I need it for.
"The Worst !  Range and clarity sucks. this my second one , no better then the first"
Fantastic product. Works beautifully for beach bumming and long camping trips if you need your iPhone. 
Wife is happy with this product.
It is a great sport watch but some times it gets freezed and you have to reset it.
The jambox is great. The sound is better than expected and the device is extremely easy to set up and use with my iPhone. I was however disappointed when I saw it advertised for much less from kohl's.
"Excellent fit, holds my phone securely, backing doesn't allow sweat to get to my phone. Great range of adjustment possible (how-to is in their instructions) for very small to very large arms!<br /><br />Note that this is open-faced, so don't treat it as actually waterproof (the manufacturer is clear on this as well, so no complaint -- just pointing it out!)."
Good
arrived quickly- very satisfied
just don't like it
I really love the case. When through our 1st fall a day after my case arrived and I can tell you now is I didn't have this case n screen protector I would be looking for another phone right now!!!!
"Cute phone case but cheaply made, it broke a few months after I bought it."
Horrible the app that you are supposed to use is not on Google play store
The case fit my iPhone 5S perfectly. I have no complaints about the product. So cool.
Case does not fit phone. Just lying around
"its exceed my expectation, perfect material made of, quick charger for your electronic devices."
"Seidio did a great job with this case. It fits really snug with the form factor of the iPhone 6 Plus and doesn't leave any gaps for debris or foreign material to get in and scratch the phone. Moreover, the actual case itself is quite thin and sleek, while still offering great protection against scratches and drops. The kickstand on the back is a nice added touch, although it can be at times hard to pop out. When it is out, it feels strong and secure.<br /><br />The case itself is made of two pieces (top and bottom) that slides on and off the device. There is a locking mechanism though that works well - I've never had a problem with the two pieces separating.<br /><br />Overall, a protective case that is also stylish and fits well with the iPhone 6 Plus: 5 stars."
"Easy to put on the phone. Love the smooth texture that allows it to easily slide into my pocket, but allows no slipping from my hand.<br />So far a very protective case."
"Pros:<br />Vent clip is pretty strong, doesn't move at all once installed.<br />Choice of how to mount the magnet<br />Fully adjustable.<br />Cons:<br />Depending on you're case, you may have some trouble. I have an Otterbox on my HTC One, which has a plastic case over a silicon case. if I put the magnet on the inside next to the phone, there was too much distance between the 2 for it to hold firmly. However,m there was a small circular tab on the plastic part of the case. I trimmed it down, and the magnet fit fine.<br />The ball joint isn't really that strong. My phone kept moving turning while I was in a curve. This was solved by *really* cranking down on the locking collar, but I'm not a tiny guy; my wife would never be able to put enough force on it to hold it in place.<br />Finally, the biggest problem; the magnet strength. My car isn't the smoothest riding car on the road, bu even *slight* bumps would case the phone to move a little. After a while, the phone would either turn sideways/upside down, or just fall off. It was &#34;ok&#34; on the highway, but on ramps and smaller roads were almost unusable. To be fair, my phone's kind of heavy. With case, my phone is about 225-230 grams. My wife's Galaxy S6 stays fine (Same issue with the case, however), and it weighs about 180 grams. I'd estimate anything over 200 grams would be a problem.<br /><br />My seem like a pretty negative review, but if you're phone is light enough/case thin enough, and you can tighten the collar enough, I'm sure it would be just fine.<br /><br />*Side note* might be unrelated, but my phone acted weird with the magnet under the case. Screen would turn off if the phone moved while it was attached, the screen would bug out occasionally: it looked like the resolution dropped severely, and the colors change. Never did it before, and only did it once after I removed the magnet. Might be nothing, but bears mentioning."
Exactly what I expected at a fair price plus delivery speed was exceptional...thamks
Love this case! So lightweight and lots of colors to choose from! Tempered glass is amazing!
"Works right,  charges every time for me. The materials and workmanship is crap. The rubbber/foam that contacts the phone doesn't hold up.<br />One day,  just driving along my phone & charger just drops to the floorboards,  scaring the crap out of me. One of the joints came unglued. Yeah,  they just used a dot of Superglue to keep some pieces together.<br />I fixed it with some hardware so it's stronger than when I first received it,  but that's not the point. I shouldn't have to within two months of receiving.<br /><br />Tl;Dr great deal if you have the talent/skill to fix what falls apart.  I would buy again."
"Very nice, durable material.  No complaints"
Excellent Thank You..
Perfect for exercising. Surprisingly good sound.
I love it
Perfect protection & easily accessible once you get it broke in or used to the one handed technique to get it off the holster.
I really love this case. looks really nice and protects my iphone.  had a cheap one that didn't do a good job and had a chip on the corner of my iphone. would order again.
prefect.
Works great with my iPhone 6. Use it to link to computer for backup.
love
Great product wish I got it when I was at the Apple Store but glad I waited to ordered it. Does what it says and looks great with anything!
I ONLY GOT 2 1/2 MONTHS SERVICE FROM THIS PH IT'S SITTING DWN AT HOME NOT TURNING ON OR CHARGING WHAT CAN I DO? CAN I GET ANOTHER PH FR U GUYS?
Love it!!!  Just as nice if not nicer than my hubby's Otterbox and less than half the price.  Good deal...good price....good service.....what else could a girl ask for.....
The case is already breaking...not satisfied
Good item
Battery was weak giving a spotty signal to my Vivosmart but once the battery was replaced it is spot-on now.
"I tried various different phone holders, this is the most solid one. It works well with regular cars. For tall vehicles such as minivans, however, it is a little too low in position."
I am very pleased with the Pyle 7500 Car Backup Camera.  The large screen with the distance scale lines make backing up very easy.  I wish I had purchased it sooner!
"Functions as advertised. I dropped this phone a couple of a dozen times in a machine shop and only once did a crack appear, and even still the phone was completely functional and the crack did not obscure the screen; you have to angle the phone to try and find the crack it isn't even visible straight-on. The phone functioned for another month with the crack in the protector before I got a new one. The protector did exactly what it was supposed to, and even held together after it cracked. It does NOT cover the entire glass screen, but you would be hard pressed to damage the edge of the screen without hitting the rounded chamfer of the protector, and even if you did, the protector covers the entire visible portion of the screen, so it would not impair use."
"Great Product. Everything you need to install is in the package as well as extra screen protectors. I've had mine for a few months and not a scratch on it. They send an email with instructions, which is very helpful also. I really like that it's perfectly made for my iPhone and it hasn't started to peel. Works great!"
My phone had fell on concrete and it fell on its face and it did not crack
this is an extremely cheap case and its better than any case ive ever had before. because the inside of the case is mostly air pockets when you drop it one any corner of on its back it literally just bounces of the ground without damaging the phone.
great
Very good product. I would buy again from this company. No problems.
"We bought this for our daughter's phone, its a good solid strong case that will protect the phone."
I love the look and feel but I have gone through 4 cases in 6 months for the same reason as everyone else has posted. If they sold just the outer bumper for half the cost I might rate it 3 stars. Customer service was good but seriously....4 times? They need to sell the outer bumper separately. Poor engineering.
"Finally!  This RAVPower 6 Port Desktop Charging Station is wonderful.  Both my wife and I are heavy tech users and each with a mix of systems and brands; pretty much everyone in our situation has a power strip nearby that is polluted with plugs and chargers for laptops and tablets, phones and accessories, driven by Microsoft and Apple and Google and Bluetooth.  The iSmart Technology in this powered charger allows me to use one plug on the power strip to charge up to 6 different devices with differing input power needs, and the only common denominator is USB.  I now have two of these, one each for my wife and myself, am thrilled with both, and recommend them highly."
Great case
"Overall I like this case. It keeps my phone safe from drops, but the bottom part of the case keeps falling off. It would be nice if there were a way for the two parts of the case to snap or click together to prevent this."
"So far so good.  Am a heavy user of my smart phone and by lunch I am usually stuck to a power cord.  This battery is now lasting about a full day.  Update - After a couple weeks, I am still super happy.  This battery is a beast.  Love it.  Wish it were just a little bigger, but works so great for me."
I would not recommend. Shattered on the first drop including my iPods screen.
"A little hard to figure out how to put on the phone at first and really hard to get the phone out of the case once snapped in.  However, I have dropped my phone a few times (short distance) and the case and phone are just fine."
Excellent value for the money
Love it!
"Great case,fits well."
"Big and Bulky, but this workhorse does the job.  When I travel, I want reliable and long-lasting, and this battery pack does the job.  The two different ports boast different speeds to charge at.  1.5v charges on a regular time frame.  the 2.1v charges like it's on steroids.  It's not discreet, it's not light-weight, but effective!"
"Great phone case/cover at an amazing price! It's durable and fits my phone/ports perfectly!<br />Honestly, it offers the same protection but with more durability than my last OtterBox case."
"very good product very comfortable to use but it is also inconvenient, if your phone runs out of charge during the day your only option is to removed the wireless receiver from the phone in order to use a charging cable"
Works great
"Each cord is 10 foot long, so you have more than enough room to move around a little bit if you need too. I received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
Cool ohone case and protects my screen.
Does exactly what it says on the Tin
great quality
"Works well. I actually purchased a second charging station because I wanted to be able to charge in multiple places. It's very cool, especially the secondary battery attachment that comes with it."
"What a great little recorder! Video quality is great. It's funny that I get a note to review this device only a few days after I witness a traffic accident where both drivers claimed &#34;the light was green&#34;. My recorder captured the entire event and provided proof of liability for the driver that ran the traffic light. The only issue that I have is that the &#34;emergency&#34; mode recording is triggered extremely easily (perhaps by going over a speed bump with anything buy extreme care). Setting the sensitivity to low (or even high) makes no difference. The bracket provided, while fine for most applications, did not have the range of motion needed for my car and where I needed to mount it. I had to hack up the bracket and cobble in some plastic pieces to fit the camera in front of the rear-view mirror where it would not interfere with my vision.<br /><br />Otherwise a great, inexpensive product that I highly recommend."
The case seemed to attract dirt... Product is just ok
junk
This cable was just right for a new clutch purse/battery that I just bought. Will buy from this merchant again--should the need arise.
I love It...
Broke after 1 use.
Love this cover super cute.. Only four stars because it's so bulky any fit it in my back pocket because of all the decorations. It is very pretty and they give you extra rhinestones!!
Ordered this product as a replacement for the original which I lost.  Arrived a day early and I've been using it for a week.  Pink/purple color makes it very easy to find and differentiate from other power cords.  Works great so far.
It is a nice case.
Works great! Don't have to use a bunch of different wall outlets to charge a bunch of devices.
"Works great, like it supposed to, would definitely recommend."
Works great!
I love it! The sound is great and the battery lasts a while
I love my  Amazon
Good price for product.
Came at a decent time. I was a little worried when I first received the box because it was all beat up and covered in tape with writing all over it but when I opened it up everything seemed fine and nothing looked damaged. The heads work great. A little bigger then what I was expecting but they sound good and also it pairs up with my phone without any problems. So overall it was a decent buy for the price.
I loveee Pokemon so much and so this case is amazing !!! The drawing does not peel off and it takes a while for it to scratch and to break it arrived on time and I just love it !! But one small thing is that it's a little loose but nothing really big to worry about but I recommend it !!!!
Does it's job well.
"Exact fit , especially like the built - in screen protector. Only one I found that had a protected charging port , keeps the  dirt out .."
Good
This should be bundled with Metra Axxess ASWC-1 Universal Steering Wheel Control Interfance or it should be in the product description that when the Chevrolet Cruze has a steering wheel control it needs the Metra Axxess ASWC-1 Universal Steering Wheel Control Interfance
Excellent - as usual with Amazon - never been disappointed!
"Bought it as a gift to my wife for her new phone.. She loved it.. And I often see her using the pockets for cards, when she doesn't want to bring her purse"
I was expecting the same connector as was provided with the phone.  It instead had a standard micro USB connector rather than the USB 3.
"Had it four months now, not a bad case for the money. Oil and dirt get ground into the back plate and make subtle but permanent stains. Case is durable, protects the NOTE 4 well. Holes, speakers, stylus, camera, and buttons all line up well. Fits the international version of the phone like a glove!"
"When was the last time someone said to you, &#34;I like your phone case, where did you get that?&#34; Cases allow you to say something about yourself the same way a t-shirt or a hair cut can be an extension of your personality. If you grew up with Legos or know someone who did and still finds themselves starring down the Lego aisle at a store, this is a MUST HAVE! The only negative I can say about this product is that there are limited color options. The bottom cut out also provides plenty of corner protection without interfering with headphones/speakers/port. Fits 5S perfect right out the box."
Dis colored within a few weeks
"Great buy and great price. Works just fine, almost no problems what so ever."
"Love it! It's soft so it doesn't scratch or damage my watch, plus it hides most of the cord inside the bowl. Would definitely recommend this product."
"There's not too much detail to go into here. This works exactly as it should, to recharge my Jawbone Up band."
Works great
I like some much
Just got it in the mail today. I purchased the green/gray for my note 5. Not as vivid as the green looks online. The case is light. Feels durable. Fits the phone well. Buttons function well. No issues with the touchscreen. Not real comfortable with the access ports to the charger and aux cord input. They are a bit tough to move back...as in the little flap pushes against the charger and the aux cord. Not an issue for now. But will come back to update how well it holds up after everyday charging and a lot of aux cord/headphone use.
"Have not mastered it yet,voice command not working properly"
"This sounds ok but cuts out when you walk, the bluetooth isn't very strong. And this one has an annoying green light that flashes and can't be turned off.<br /><br />I bought a different one with prime that was much better. I only bought this one because it was $10 dollars. But it's not worth even that."
"very good. small, fast charge, can charge my old phone battery. (not smartphone) It can charge 3.7v battery."
Very cute
"The quality seem very good at first, but I had problems trying to turn it off and processing through the menu. I have owned this model for appox six months. I don't know if the summer heat in the car. got to it, which may be affecting it. Maybe the low price is not such a long lasting good deal."
Excellent product. Very satisfied with the retractable cords. it's elegant and almost invisible. Sound is clear and microphone works great.
Awesome case! Just wish it gave u the option to buy without the built in screen so I can put an HD screen on it instead of the crappy plastic it comes with. I dropped it over 20x's already & my phone is still in perfect condition!!
"I've only used Tempered glass screen protectors for my iPhone 6.  This is as good as the best of them. Tempered glass protectors in general have a great feel to them, and they look great.  They crack and shatter pretty easily, but I think of it as &#34;better the protector the the actual iPhone display.&#34;<br /><br />Also, no stupid bubbles on the display."
works
Very practical device Thank you
Works as promised
Sound is ok. Not worth the price. Bluetooth disconnects constantly. Very unhappy with product.
Good quality....clear picture......Happy child!
"I bought a pair of these back in March and only now (late-August) have had a chance to use one of them (the other is a spare). It turns out for my use-case this gadget is pretty-much spot-on.<br /><br />The Steambot Slider works exactly as intended in a Smart ForTwo Pure with the base head-unit which has both a USB and a 3.5mm audio jack for auxiliary device input. The Steambot plugs into the USB (for power only) and the included audio cable connects the output of the Steambot to the 3.5mm audio input. After starting the car I can hear start-up tones from the Streambot from the sound system. It takes me a few moments to start the audio source on my iPhone (I might use the iTunes Music app, the SiriusXM app, or the app for my local NPR station) but once I've started the app, the sound plays through as expected.<br /><br />The only &#34;negative&#34; I have experienced is the 20 second time-out of the Steambot. If I take too long to get the audio app running on my iPhone the Steambot times out and turns off. To turn it back on I have to open the glove box and then unplug/plug the Steambot. This is a slight inconvenience. If the USB and audio port were on the dashboard this wouldn't be much of a inconvenience but in the ForTwo the inputs are in the glovebox so it is what it is."
Comfortable fit. Easy to set up and use with my phone. Great price.
Just as described- great tools for the job! Everything worked well. Very happy with my purchase. I would completely recommend!
These are an excellent set of Bluetooth earbuds. They're comfortable and sound is great! Thanks.
Was worried would be a bit bulky but it's no bigger than my old lifeproof case. Would recommend.
Great case for my active lifestyle. Fit my s6 active perfectly.
Works as described.
"had my plastic screen protector for a while and decided to replace with this, as long as your screen is free of any lint or dust this protector should stick to your phone perfectly! i didn't had to squeeze any bubbles out . also the products that comes in the package really helps with the cleaning."
Works awesome so far!
"This band works as described. It fits well and is easy to put on. It's best if you use the safety bands that can be purchased separately in case you get your watch band caught on something, then it won't go flying off."
It does not stays put. I attach it to the glass but it does not stays. The cellphone is well taken but the device itself does not remain attached to the glass.
This case is awesome for the price.
Do not buy this. The charger does not stay in the jack and the swivel arm falls down constantly. This is a horrible product.
I purchased this case and it did not  fit my phone.
This is literally a photocopy of this case. It's not glittery or sparkly.  Do not waste your money because you have to pay for shipping there and back to return.
Hey man no gorilla glass this is misinformation.
holds a charge for a long time and charges my phone rapidly
"Great case to protect the phone. My phone died, so I had to return the phone and take off the case. I had to bend the aluminum case just to get it off, pretty much breaking it. Impossible to get off once it's on your phone."
"Works great, had no issues  installation."
nice
"A really good Unlocked smart phone at a good price, I use un-limited Talk, Message and Data using Straight Talk's $45 a month card."
"I wore these twice, and I was very disappointed. They're heavy and didn't fit well in my ears (even when I swapped the ear bud pieces for my second run with them). The sound quality was poor, and the signal strength connecting with my iphone was disappointing. The purchase was an unfortunate waste of my money; my regular ear buds work so much better."
"Very burkly and can't waterproof,DON'T BUY IT"
fits right
Not official samsung headphones. Sound quality is horrible compared to the headphones that came with the phone. $9 is not worth the hassle of returning the headphones.
excelent
I am pleased with the product and the view that it gives. I would have given it a five star rating if the information that came with the kit dealing with installation and operation was more complete. Although tech support was right on.
"The Docking Cradle works fine. But this was not my problem. I have to replace the antenna, the cable connection is bad. I keep loosen the signal."
Great product. If you have any issues with the kit they provide excellent customer service & respond in a timely manner. I would recommend to everyone !!
Does not come with a regular size SD holder so you can put it in a card reader.  Lucky I had an old one.
Did not fit my phone. Way too big for my phone. Unsatisfied...
Love this wallet camera case.  It is holding up much better than the cheaper versions.
This is the best car mount holder ever.
"We got our phones at the same time and I bought a Sahara case and my wife some other brand. Mine is still in perfect condition and hers is is falling apart. We just got a Sahara case for her iPhone 6. Fits perfectly, the glass shield is easy to apply with no bubbles underneath Fter installation. A good well priced product that meets the claims of the manufacturer."
"Love it, looks nice, fit perfectly"
Great case if you drop your phone a lot
"Amazing car mount. Plenty of way to get it attached to any phone you have. I have a Note 3 and my girlfriend has a iphone 6, works great with both. Suction cup has a strong hold on windshield or dash (tested it on the dash and needed some force to take it off). Metal plate for magnet holder slipped right under my battery cover without any bulging. Great mount for reasonable price. Very satisfied!!****"
"I like it but it scratches up very easily. Better the case than the phone of course, but they could have made the case more scratch resistant. This case has saved my phone from a few small falls, but i don't know if it would save it from bigger falls... I'd buy it again, but i am looking at alternatives."
Very good condition
"Best investments iPhone case wise. No longer do I carry my wallet and cash. Just my DL, American Express and 2 Debit cards."
Cover didn't fit the phone there are different mototolla phones mine is a droid maxx which this cover was to small
Worked out beautifully for the issue I was having.
Stopped charging my iphone 5s a month after purchase and I used them infrequently before that.
"Works perfectly fine but.....  1)I received a damaged touchscreen, there is a dark spot, the size of a water droplet, a blob of dead pixels.  2)There is also an extreme bright white spot on the lower part of the screen  3)When u turn on the lights for the 3 navigation buttons at bottom of the screen, light escapes from a little gap between the touchscreen and the frame."
Great product and works great. Having it 10 ft long is nice and can reach anywhere.
"Better than I thought. The cards DO NOT actually obstruct the screen as it may appear in the picture,  and you can pretty easily fit two cards in the one slot. Only downside is that it takes like 4 weeks to ship... But then it showed up a week early making it three weeks (which is still too long)."
Great Speaker for the money for sure.  Good Quality and sound. It's not as loud as my Braven but it didn't cost $100 either.
Great buy!  Good fit and easy to adjust.
I love my case
I really love these chargers! I was looking for something very long to allow for plenty room to move while charging. The covering on the wire is like a paracord type wrapping which provides a feeling of strength. The end that plugs into the ipad is very flexible without bending to break wires within.
"Best charging cord ever!!!!!! Not only do I thoroughly enjoy the length of this cord, it does charge my phone a lot faster than the factory cable that comes with the phone."
it worked well for about 3 and a 1/2 months and all of a sudden it would not charge.  When it was put to charge it smelled like it was burning.  I was so excited for this product but it was disappointing in the end.
"This mini selfie stick is a great idea. I’ve seen a lot of selfie sticks and been able to test out a lot of them, but this one is just a great concept. First of all, it takes the selfie stick to a new level by making it smaller. Most selfie sticks are already compact, but this one can fold up until it’s just a bit larger than your mobile smart phone. Second, when it’s fully extended (it has a telescoping arm) it feels sturdier than some of the full sized selfie sticks. This particular mini selfie stick comes equipped with a corded remote. I rather prefer this kind to the Bluetooth connection because I feel like it’s more reliable. My iPhone 6 fit well in the phone clamp and I was never concerned about its security.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&#34;"
I have so many cords running every where when I try to charge something it becomes a hassle! Well with this 5 port charger I can keep things a bit more organized! I put the fat square bread ties around the cord and then plug it in and then I know what is what. This charger helps me keep everything a bit more organized and charges super fast! I did receive this for an honest unbias review. Over all I am super happy with this charger.
Does the job.
"Awesome charger, powers up my phone really fast. Thanks"
"Another excellent product from Anker. Works great, very well made."
Great case and looks very nice !
Looks great with good cutouts
"Bottom front lip is thin/flimsy leaving the from exposed, this also curves into Spen area.<br /><br />Normally these cases are on point, they refunded me the purchase price at least.<br /><br />Will order again once they fix the manufacturing defects."
I am very satisfied with my order. Nice case for my tablet.
"piece of junk, doesn't want to hang right, the stickers they give you to put it up , don't stay and the brackets that the magnets are in are all chipped and broken , I sent mine back"
"Works as expected. I wish that I could get to the photo button though,"
This one DOES charge an UP 1st gen
Easily the best and heftiest charger I've ever had.
Very handy.  Keeps all your chargers at your fingertips!  Can charge multiple items at once!  Replay great.
Ok
Great protective case!<br />I've been using mine for 2 years now and had multiple oops I dropped my phone incidents and no damage!
"You Must Buy This One in the event that You Travel A Lot. It Has huge Capacity, i charge my galaxy s6 about 3 times.The 4 LEDS give me an estimated sign of the charging and remaining status. Which is Great For Android Mob. Telephones in the event that You Watch Movies a considerable measure While Traveling."
Arrived on time and as described
"Awesome head set, Great sound quality, easy to use and comfortable. Connects quickly to my phone. I like the fact it works  with the I Phones voice commands. Good Value"
Works great and easy to use. I now have surround sound on my TV and can hear shows over the humming air conditioner. My only gripe is that the sound from the TV doesn't sync with the Bluetooth sound in speakers so I have to mute the TV. For 20 bucks I'm happy
I ordered this item for.my husband and he absolutely loved it...thank you very much.  Works great
"These are so annoying!!! When I run they slide out slowly, so I keep having to push them in every few minutes. Also, the flat wire causes for a scratch-scratch sound with every. single. step. Very obnoxious, sounds like a DJ that keeps scratching the disc."
Great charger. Replaced the need for rotating different cables for different devices. Everything stays plugged in.
otter box  said it is a fake......will not warranty this
Great case!
"I like.is very,stronger,and water proof,niceeeeee,,"
"Really very functional - quick delivery, absolutely loved it. Top marks!"
c
Poorly made. Refund is worthless as they charge as much to return it as the original cost. Don't bother with it...
"Be careful when ordering, there is no way this cover fits the s6 edge, it about 3/4 the size and will not stretch"
"Fits well, looks good, magnet holds flap closed, price was right. Very happy."
"my camera sucks. even when i do screenshots and send an sms, the megapixels for just awful.<br />This phone doesn't do group texts. if i group two ppl together, i get separate chat logs for each reply i receive back.<br />There's also no quiet hours i can apply like my old windows phone."
"Great case. Inexpensive, decorative, quite thin.<br />I love it!"
"Exactly what I wanted. It's very thin and smooth, doesn't look bulky. I'm not sure how well it would protect the phone if I dropped it but so far so good."
"I use this charger for my iphone 6 plus.  As a case, it provides reasonable protection against routine bumps and drops.  As a backup charger, it's good for 80% charge of a fully drained iphone 6 plus.  Unlike certain other charger cases, this charger uses iphone's own charging cord and let's you use regular headphones without a special adapter, which is really convenient.  Unfortunately, you cannot charge the iphone while the phone is in the case.  You can only charge the case and then use the case to charge the phone."
Worked as advertised
Despite some reviewers concerns that this case was difficult to install I had no problems.  It isn't as bulky as more expensive competitors but provides a similar type of protection.  For the price this case/protector can't be beat.
Works well so far.  All you have to is place the phone on the pad.  No cables to deal with.
This was for my 17 yr old daughter who has issues with dropping things etc. So far This phone has stood the test. As far as mechanics and features she seems pleased with it.
I really liked this product. Very smooth feel - even better than actual screen. Which is strange because you would never say that about a condom. Anywho my opinion changed when a 36&#34; fall from my desk onto carpet caused the screen protector to crack. Very delicate.
Must have if you are among those who have forgotten license or credit acrd at home and have started driving with just phone in hand
Great color and offers great protection while looking good
"I have had the adapter for 5 days...<br />Paired, played, talked, and tethered with this adapter 3 ways to Sunday.<br />Besides the bad reviews...(It breaks, muffled sound, repairing, or it just plain stops working) at this point I can say that it is worth a 3-4 star rating.  Lets be honest with each other....<br />There are only a few reasons why you are reading any of these reviews for a Bluetooth receiver.<br />1. You are too broke (like me) to buy a newer car that has Bluetooth capabilities.<br />2. You are too cheap (like me) to buy a newer car or stereo that has Bluetooth features.<br />3. You are looking to rid yourself of cords and use that fancy smartphone of yours (like me).<br /><br />I have two cars (that are paid off...did I say that I was smart and cheap?)<br />04 Honda Accord with a broken CD player (who uses those anymore huh?) no AUX, and no USB.<br />04 Toyota Carola with tape deck (who even has tapes anymore huh?) no AUX, and no USB. Been using a AUX Cassette Adapters for any phone that has an AUX."
"It is really great , I recommend it"
great
"I'm absolutely amazed that somebody figured out an intelligent and reliable way to apply screen protection to a smartphone. I have two S6 Edge+ phones, and I applied this protector on each one of them right before I went to bed. Zero bubbles and much fewer issues than any other protector I've used. Wraps perfectly around the edge and feels pretty good. Not as smooth as the ultra smooth glass on the Edge+, but definitely very high quality."
"Took about 2 hours to install, but the effort was worth it.  I would had spent twice as much at the mall for a generic screen.  I got the original screen and fixed it at half the price."
Once u take the film off so u can attach one side to the phone the protector bends and does not want to fit to the phone. Lifts on all sides. Not a good quality...
Works great
"I've been replacing all breaking cords withe these over time and I love them.<br />The quality of insulation is great and I'm sure they will stand the test of time.<br />And how convenient is this multi-length set!  I use the long one for my son's tablet in the car (he's in the back seat), the medium ones in the front seat or at my office desk, and the shortest stays with my travel/lipstick chargers for charging on the go.<br /><br />Not to mention that the company is great: They stand behind their products and are service oriented."
a
Cheaply made but adequate for the price.
Really nice comfy headphones. Sink up to my phone easy. Sound quality is actually really good.
fits good. just wanted something to soften drops just in case. fits the bill
"This is a pretty good drive cam. Below are my thoughts.<br /><br />*** POSITIVE ***<br /><br />* Includes a good SanDisk 32GB card. At the settings I used (1920x1080/1080FHD) , It takes about 188MB for 2 minutes or 94MB per minute, so 32GB gives about 5.5 hours of record time which is pretty good in my opinion.<br />* The suction cup is strong when mounted properly.<br />* The size of the camera is good, but there are even smaller ones.<br />* Audio quality is pretty good... better than another drive cam I have.<br />* The wide 150 degree field of view seems just right for a drive cam.<br />* Video quality during the day and night is good... video is smooth. I had no problems sticking the micro SDHC card into an SD adapter then into an SD card reader and then playing the recording video with Windows Media Player.<br />* The camera can be set to automatically come on when power is supplied and start recording (with a delay of 0, 10, 20, or 30 seconds), and then to turn off automatically when power is lost. The built-in battery allows you to keep recording after power loss for 0, 10, 20, or 30 seconds (it's one of the options).<br />* Once setup properly it should work without any maintenance (the way it should be) as it keeps a rolling video record.<br />* Nicely packaged and boxed.<br />* Comes with a one year &#34;hassle - free&#34; warranty that can be extended by 6 months if you register your product.<br /><br />*** NEGATIVE ***<br /><br />* Perhaps I got a defective power cord, but I had some serious issues getting a stable power connection plugging the power cord into a car power outlet. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and assume something was wrong with my power cord so I won't deduct much for this.<br />* The camera caught reflections on the windshield... it would be better if this camera had a polarized lens or filter to reduce the reflections... or positioning the lens closer to the windshield would probably help too.<br />* While playing around and reviewing some photos, it crashed and locked-up (but this is the only time I experienced a lock-up).<br /><br />*** OTHER ***<br /><br />* It's hard to read license plates unless the car is right in front of you but this is typical for cameras of this resolution<br />* Don't forget to remove the protective film over the lens<br />* I thought about uploading some video from the drive cam but Amazon wouldn't show it in a resolution that does it justice. You may want to search YouTube for videos that preserve the image quality that this drive cam is capable of.<br />* The camera is somewhat easy to remove from the mount. My other drive cam is easier to remove... but you probably won't be removing it much anyway.<br /><br />Overall 4 stars. Not a bad camera at all if your power cord works well and you don't mind the other, relative minor, negatives.<br /><br />NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.up).  *** OTHER ***  * It's hard to read license plates unless the car is right in front of you but this is typical for cameras of this resolution * Don't forget to remove the protective film over the lens * I thought about uploading some video from the drive cam but Amazon wouldn't show it in a resolution that does it justice.

"This is actually worse than the battery it was ordered to replace.  From some back of the napkin calculations, I'd guess this has ~60% of the capacity that it claims. I would not recommend."
"This item is fine, but why, OH WHY does it have an LED on it?<br /><br />Let me explain...<br /><br />I'm guessing most people charge their phones, etc., at night. I'm guessing a lot of them, like me, have their charger by their bed.<br /><br />And I'm also guessing most people want to sleep in a more-or-less dark room.<br /><br />Well, TOO BAD, because rather than looking at your device to see if the charger is working (which you will do anyway, to make sure the cord works and is plugged in all the way), this charger, by your bed, has a nice, bright LED on it to tell you it is working.<br /><br />Even sticking it in a nightstand drawer gave the outline of the drawer a real special-effect, &#34;E.T.&#34; sort of glow.<br /><br />Okay, fine, it's a small problem—a piece of electrical tape over the light solved it—but I'm continuously baffled by things like this. I have hearing loss, and the electric hearing drier I put my hearing aids in at night has FOUR LEDs on it. Can't even keep it in the same room with me if I want to sleep. I could read by it.<br /><br />I'm sure Anker put a light on this to try to be helpful, but honestly it seems like it's not really paying attention to the most common use case? Or perhaps &#34;charging at night on your bedside table&#34; is an edge case?<br /><br />Otherwise, it absolutely works. Rant aside, I'd buy it again."
the touch is not at all good and the phone is very slow
Best one you can buy!
Beautiful case. Got my phone very nicely. Well pleased
It quit working after 44 days. Do not waste your money.
"It works, just not very strong, could have been made out of some harder plastic.  but like i said, it fits and works like a charm."
This case is awesome!!! I absolutely love it!!! I even ordered a pink one.
Very good piece of equipment. I use it every day while riding and have been very pleased.
Bought this for my daughter. Love it!
excellent
Very Good! It is really sensitive to finger prints though!
"If you buy a Garmin, you have to buy this too.  Period.  YOU NEED THIS.  Ignore your innate desire to save money.<br /><br />I had a Garmin before and balked at spending so much extra money on top of an already expensive purchase.  I thought the included mount (the type that sticks on the windshield) would be perfectly sufficient.  I was very, very WRONG.  This is not just a preference; it is a matter of safety.  The windshield mounts do not work reliably enough.  They fall off all the time, no matter how well you attach them.  I had finally gotten mine to stick and then was driving on a crowded highway when the mount suddenly came loose and tumbled right at me.  Potentially, this could have caused a major accident; luckily, I only swerved slightly as a result.  However, that incident scared me and convinced me to invest in a good mount.  Frankly, I also felt that if I had spent so much on the Garmin itself, all that money would be wasted if the Garmin committed suicide by breaking free from a windshield mount.<br /><br />This particular mount is very easy to attach to the Garmin and also comes off easily when you need to take the Garmin inside for updating.  It has enough weight to it that even when you swerve suddenly because of an idiot on the road, the Garmin doesn't budge.  It's also nice being able to shift it around a bit depending on where the sun is shining in.  I think the safety considerations alone make this worth the expense, but the additional convenience and ease of use make it an even better purchase."
Works great and cheaper than the box stores.
Charges your equipment fast and always have an outlet to plug into
"Screen protector at it's best! This screen has a silky smooth feeling, easy to install and clear clarity. I don't notice a difference with the screen on, it feels and looks the same.<br />#1 Before applying the screen, clean all dust and debris from your phone. Use the alcohol pad and dust absorber. I took my phone in the bathroom then turned on the shower to settle the dust. The process took about 2 minutes  to complete.<br /><br />Good investment for your cell phone. This can save you the cost of repairing a cracked or severely scratched screen. I recieved a discount for my honest Opinion."
It fits well on my iPod touch 4th generation. BUT......... The rubberized later is kind of loose so it might not protect as well as one may want.
"The price was great and the earphones do the job, comfortable and good quality."
"The size of the phone is the main reason i made this purchase, and I def think it was the right decision. I love the functionality of this and its compact size. The camera is AMAZING, it is better than any other android phone i have own in the past."
"Well, it's been 3 years since my purchase, and this case is still working for me.  No it may not be water-proof, but put the phone ina  plastic bag or thin layer of plastic, put the excess to the back, put this phone case back on and there you go, it's semi-water proof at that point at least.  That got me through rainy work days when I had to work outside.  Either way this case has caused my phone to survive alot, I wore some pants that had awful pocket slots on them and it kept falling out of my pocket while mountain biking on pavement, my phones going on 3 years just fine.  Other than that I have also exercised extreme caution with my phone, I rarely, if ever, drop my phone under any circumstances.  This case has a great grip to it which isn't easily dropped.  I can't really say enough about this, I got mine for $5.00, however I see the price is now at about $9.97,  still a good deal, most definitely."
same as original that comes with phones.. very fast charging
Not worth it.  Either I gave it away or I tossed it
Good product
"Best bluetooth ever. Clear sound, good range, long-lasting charge."
broke within a week
"I wouldn't give one star, it's nothing what the pictures show, it's ugly and not the teal color and looks like a screen print glued to a cheap piece if sh*t case and there is no shine to it and no glittery anchor like the picture shows. Totally disappointed with this purchase, I thought I  was getting a deal, I can't give this case away, it's terrible. Back to the bulky but reliable otterbox. The picture I took does no justice, it's dull, no glitter and definitely not teal, more baby blue! :( And it is broken, the side by the power key is broken."
"As described, good chargers"
Breaks easily. Rubber cover gets dirty fast & don't protect phone really well. Screen protector that comes with it is okay.
Does exactly what you expect / need it to do.
"I plan to give this as a Christmas gift or hopefully to give away to someone who still owns a note 4, it is way too small for galaxy note 5"
"Nice compact charger for Apple watch. Watch cradles well and really can't fall out due to design & MAGNETIC watch charger hold watch in place. There's really not much you can say about the simple concept charger, SIMPLE &  works well."
Very good
"The vent option ended up being a good option as I thought it would block the AC, but it doesnt.  It just doesnt hold so well when trying to place the phone on it.  Once in place.....very secure!"
Nice
"This is a fabulous thing to have. I have a screen protector on my phone already, and even when I put it in the waterproof case I have NO trouble using the touch screen. It is simple to use, and thus far I have had no issues. I can even take great photos with the waterproof case on. Also, the neck strap is great because I can use it too attach the whole set up to my kayak and not have to worry about it falling overboard. Great deal!"
"I love the case. It came on time and came with a screen protector and small stylus, which was a great surprise. Only reason I cant give it 5 stars is because you can only put some muc b cash and cards in it. I can only handle like 4 cards with little cash. But all in all a good buy"
just installed on my note5.  looks really good to me.  no issues thus far.  easy application.
"Works great, great value for the money."
Pretty good stuff for the price..
Great item....beautiful! Thank you!
"The design and quality of this case is really excellent. This case will protect your phone from just about anything you can throw at it. You can put your phone in this case and not need to worry one bit about damaging it.<br /><br />So far I've taken this iPhone 6 adventure/underwater case with us to the water park and the lake, and the pictures have all turned out awesome. The picture quality while using this case is far better than I expected it to be. The four lenses are all excellent. They take really outstanding pictures. I particularly like the pictures taken with the wide angle lens.<br /><br />I can't imagine there being a better adventure/underwater case with lenses out there. We have been nothing but happy with it. This is a terrific adventure/underwater case. Highly recommended.<br /><br />If you have any questions about this adventure/underwater case, please feel free to ask, and I'll try my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful."
Piece of junk. Lasted 3 months. Motorola should be embarrassed to put out such a piece of junk.
"Great case,very durable and the belt clip is a great feature..... Built in screen protector is good, could be better.....well worth the money"
This wireless charger works great. Very happy with the charge speed and reliability.  Works better than the Samsung wireless charger that I was using prior.
Perfect!! Fits nicely and allows me to access all the features while exercising or simply needing to have my phone accessible while I do chores around the house.
Super cute. Serves its purpose. very feminine and dainty.
Good!
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
Replacement battery for a 2.5 year old Samsung Galaxy S3. Works very well and keeps the phone charged for more than a day with minimal use.
My daughter loved this and got a lot of complements from her friends.
"The product was as described, it arrived very quickly, but many people I talk to you the phone can't hear me very well.  It is possible that the case somehow blocks the speaker slightly to cause this problem.  I am pleased as to the quality with that exception."
it is very cute but I would not buy again. Started falling apart as soon as we started using it.
Good
was great  doing the job  very happy
If I could get rid of the busy signal it would be OK. It has nothing to do with charging the unit. I have it plugged in to the wall. It's compleatly  unusable.
"Great battery that held a long charge. I was surprised how awesome this battery was given my previous experience with a battery order from a different company that turned out to be warped. I was wary but grateful this turned out to be a very good purchase decision. Definitely worth a reorder in the future, as needed."
Very nice to just be able to set my phone on it and begin charging right away! I would buy it again.
"I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. This case is very easy to put together. Basically you remove the back of your phone, as well as the battery. You then pop in their uniquely shaped battery and then put place your battery on top of theirs. Next you use their case to cover the back and the frame of your phone. Overall its a super easy process and it actually work!<br /><br />Before using this product, I would have to charge my battery everyday (at night time). However, since using their battery, it has double, almost tripled my battery life. Now, I only have to charge my phone approximately every two days. The only thing I don't like about the case is the quality. It seems like this is the most popular complaint about the product. If they would just change the quality of the case, particularly the frame, this would be the perfect, most stylish product on the market.<br /><br />Because of the quality of the product, I only use it when I'm at home. If I go anywhere, I normally change it back to my standard case. However, my final thoughts on this is that its a great buy and it really does extend the battery life!"
"These are great headphones for sub $30. I've had these now for over 2 months and can tell you they provide sound quality to that of headphones that are over $100. The fit is excellent. I've not had great fit experience in the past with other products that go in my ear. They are very comfortable to wear. Overall I'm very happy with this product. Highly recommend if you're looking for a great sounding, comfortable pair of in-ear headphones.<br /><br />I purchased this product from Amazon and have not received any compensation, free product or other benefit from the manufacturer or Amazon for my review. The product tested was NOT a free sample from the manufacturer and the opinions stated above are solely mine based on my interaction with the product."
Nice to have an after-market product that works and does not carry the heavy price tag of the name brand.
very pretty color
It is everything i expected :)
"perfect fit, great quality"
used it for 3 days and protective layer started to come off and wires are starting to fray
"Great item, protects the phone well and doesn't hold oily residue like the plastic screen protectors."
The NOOT battery charger is compact and efficient.  It works like a charm.
Fit my phone perfectly and isn't that bulky doing it...
Best non-Apple chargers ever.
Came on time what i expected fair pricing said 39.99 on package well worth the 7.95
Best sub
"So far works great. In fact,  I ordered one, liked it so much, that I ordered three more. However when the three others came in they were similar products but had slightly different markings as well as connection. Not sure that it matters in the product performance, but unexpected."
"This device was the perfect solution for listening to music in my car.  My car came with a factory-installed iPod cable for listening to music through the radio, but after 4 years it no longer works. It would have been $445 to repair!  I started looking for a cheaper alternative, and this is it.  I am also happy that since my car has both a USB and auxiliary port, this little device charges itself as I drive.  I'm also happy that I can use my iPhone 6 with a Lifeproof case on it without having to worry about a headphone adaptor for the case, since I'm now using the phone's Bluetooth.  Also, I'm not sure if this applies to all phones, but I can still receive Bluetooth calls through the car's system, and it will just pause the music Bluetooth on this device.  Easy to install and easy to use!"
"Bought this 2 weeks ago, already doesn't work..."
The charger is great in terms of how easy it was to manage multiple devices for more than 1 person on a long international trip.  My only complaint was that the on/off switch stopped functioning about halfway through the trip and I had to unplug it from the wall whenever I wanted to turn it off.
"this case is awesome! barely adds any size, but gives great protection. I'd highly recommend it. I've tried 3 other cases and this is easily the best."
Bought it going by its claim that it works with iPhone6+ but for some reason it isn't working. Straight out of the box it didn't work so not sure if it's just a faulty piece or it's not meant for 6+. I bought it over a month ago and didn't bother using it earlier since I had bought it for an upcoming trip but now it's past that 1 month deadline so I'm stuck with it and I'll have to buy another one from a local store where I could return it right away if it doesn't work. BEWARE !!
It works but does not fit 2000 tacoma
"These cables are much lower in cost than the apple brand,but they work wonderfully!Apple certified.Work great!!!!"
Was easy to to put on and came in fast!
It gets really dirty on the edges and you can't clean it no matter how hard you scrub.
This product worked well....for two months.  It became unchargable and progressively discharged even while on the charging stand.  I was able to get it to a 13% charge and did a reset .  Subsequently got a 70% charge only to get a very rapid discharge again prior to any use.  Trash.
Bought this cable to charge phone in my bag while commuting. The original Apple cable is long and get tangled and kinks toward the USB port. This is perfect size and fit.
"nice product for a quick charge when no access to electricity.  Beach, long bike rides, etc. Don't be left without cell phone power !!"
Loved the color was a true purple but the mic stopped working after a month
excellent product!
Works like a charm. I destroyed my previous cable but am happy now.
I can't live without this battery case!
Dropped my phone and the case broke right a way
"Sturdy and easy to find. Protects phone , stand is really convenient !"
"This cable is great!  It's even better quality than I was expecting, and it's clearly going to hold up for a long time."
My son loves his new case. Its a good case and will help protect his phone!
My charger works great and comes in handy. I got blue which is very pretty. The product is a little larger than I expected but that's fine because it still fits in my pocket. I just wish the package it arrived in was strong because mine arrived with a crack in it. It's not very noticeable so it's ok.
Day one: Package had a different name brand on it? oh well. looked the same sp I kept them as they seemed to be good quality...Next day I used them at the gym and I noticed it was skipping songs. tried using to make a call and kept disconnecting. Sent back. No thank you
It is beautiful and comfortable in use. I gifted the same (the black one) to my husband.
Works perfectly!
"I really do like the Silicone rubber texture feel of these Wirelessky cables<br /><br />- 15 inch is a great size but compared to my 4 FT Galaxy S6 OEM Cable it’s a huge difference so make sure you know exactly what you want to do with it… Still great to plug in to USB Hubs or Portable power chargers<br /><br />- Seems to be easier and more flexible than some cables<br />- The Micro-USB end is smaller more slim than the OEM cable (as you can see from the pictures)<br />- But the USB End is just a hair bigger<br />- Great cable, that Should fit through almost any case, slim or not<br />- Seems durable but only time will tell how truly durable it is"
Hard tontake off
Easy to put on!
Its really nice because its literally just like a wallet.
The fabric was too stretchy and the cards kept falling out of holder. I only kept it on my phone for a little longer than a week. I don't recommend this product.
"LOVE being able to charge my phone, find someplace random, and think about himself and his thoughts.  Please keep me informaed; I'll contribute in any way I can."
"perfect in every way. Charges with no problems. It does take some time to charge this unit, but it charges phones and ipad very fast."
"Bought this for a trip to the UK and was very happy we did.  Found a lot of the hotel rooms didn't haven't outlets near the bed so it was very handy to be able to charge with the external battery.  We have also found it extremely useful back in the states.  My husband likes to cycle and he uses it on his long bike rides since the Map my ride app drains his Iphone 5 battery pretty quickly.  It is on the larger side but that has not been a problem for us at all.  Our family loves it and my daughter just asked if she can have one for Christmas.  If size and weight aren't an issue for you I highly recommend this one.  For us, having more charges was more important than having a compact external battery."
"One of the four does not like to stay connected to devices so minus one star. The cables are the perfect size to accompany my battery packs for recharging on the go. And, the fun colors made giving my extras as gifts a great experience."
adorable
"I live in Egypt, and use it with Mobinil Wireless 3G USB and it doesn't work"
Very diappointing. The case is very loose and doesn't stay on the phone.
really good 5 stars
This case is amazing and fits perfectly.
I received these in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />They arrived promptly and as described.<br /><br />This 3ft charging system arrived in easy to open packaging and was simple to assemble.  My IPhone 6 didn't have a problem connecting and charging with this cable.  They are thicker than some of the less expensive models I've owned in the past.  Love it and would recommend it to anyone.
Very good quality case and awesome price!
"Great idea. App works well too. But the band itself is highly unreliable. In the 14 months since purchase, Jawbone has replaced the device four times, and this week's replacement (a new and &#34;improved&#34; version called UP2) has lasted less than two weeks before dying.<br /><br />It no longer pairs with the iPhone. What a waste of time and also money."
"I purchased this sub and box new off ebay mainly for the low profile. Fit perfectly behind the rear seats of my tundra crew max. Hooked it up to my Alpine 230w amp that was originally powering the component speakers.  The sub was blown after 3 weeks of use. Disappointed since I  never experienced the full potential of the sub. I always allow at least 1 month of break in before running the rated RMS wattage, or turning off the LPF. Replacing with pioneer shallow mount, same enclosure with slight reinforcements made. Much better"
I like that it fits me really well.
"Good coverage, great color, not too thin or thick, fits in & out of belt pouch with ease! Color is true to pic!"
"Fast delivery, works well"
"Excellent product, fast shipping!!!"
The case was really nice when I got it and didn't take that long to get to my house. The rubber raps around the front of the case which I like a lot. The only problems I had with the case were that the back of it is made of fabric so strings start to hang off the case and you have to cut them off or go over them with a lighter quickly to get rid of them.
"This case was great for the 7 or 8 months I had it. However shortly after receiving it, it started to discolor. So keep that in mind when purchasing."
Haven't tested the waterproof feature (don't want to) but the case does not snap on easily and the worst part about it is that the case has to come off completely in order to charge the phone. The opening meant for the charge port is not big enough for the charger. Shouldn't complain for as cheap as it was but it's basically useless.
"Great little charger. Finally got a chance to test this little guy yesterday when we had a power age due to wind storm in the Pacific NorthWest - which means mostly cloudy weather. Even though there were only sun breaks ( a common weather term int he PNW) this little charger was able to keep two Ipads and two Iphones charged all day (does two devices at once).  So I cannot speak to longevity - as I just bough tit - but so far so good - great actually. Very portable, I will take it on my next hiking trip or any other trip for that matter."
"There was absolutely NOTHING that I liked about this product.  The design is poor and I never could get the pen to work on my IPad air without constant skips, often my IPad air would not pick up the pen's existence at all.  You will be better off just using your finger."
I live in a travel trailer and the stock ceiling speakers that came with my new trailer just weren't cutting it. For $50 I'm jamming some better tunes.
"I loved the case when I first received it, but within 48 hours two rhinestones came off the back and the case is very hard to get on/off my phone."
Will not hold the charge just as bad as the old battery.
I'm Happy with it!!
"charges both my tablet and my cellphone. powerful yet lightweight. now if I forget to charge I have the perfect charger. have bought quite a few different chargers,and this is the perfect one. Thanks Amazon for the right price and the speedy delivery."
Love it
Excellent Thank You..
"I bought this QI charger for my HTC, I was a little worried about the overheat problem, and used it for one week and the result turns out great, the overheat problem do not exist."
look fine have not used yet
This seems to work pretty well!
Thank you! Just as described but design is already rubbing off. quick shipping!
"Great product. Quality, snug fit. Does a great job holding up to 3 credit cards. Don't bother trying more. Highly recommended."
Definitely better in and output the the one that comes with the UV-5R radio
Very Fragile.  Did not last a week on my Son's phone before it was shattered
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NWMI07S/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
This did NOT fit my phone.
I love this charger! I've been using it for over a month now and it's still intact and working well. I needed a long cable and this is what I've been looking for.
Super cute(:
Awesome product. Gives the apple watch a sportier look with some added protection
It looks amazing
"Simple, cheap, functional and even stylish. Great gadget for the smart phone user. Getting one of the larger phones (I have an iPhone 5 in a Lifecase) into the stretched web of silicone is a little tricky if you have limited handlebar real estate but once it is secured, it is SECURE. Recommended product."
Best value for price!
"Not sure what I would have done while motorcycling, in Europe, without it.  I can take the micro SD card out of my camera or GoPro, edit the video/pictures and put the cards back in the camera/tablet/gopro or phone.  Great idea/"
"The case is really cute but once you put two cards and your phone in, it is difficult to close. Also the phone isn't tight inside the case."
"i don't recommend it , I received the power bank damaged from the bottom, and also they don't put plug with the item you need to buy one to charge it."
"I am not one to write bad reviews. Actually, I don't know if I have ever given 1 star, but this one needs it. I have had my S6 now for a total of 3 days now. It was placed in this case immediately, but this morning I dropped it from about 2-3 feet up onto the tile and my S6 has suffered a small crack and even worse, a blacked out screen. Now it unusable, not covered by warranty, and I will have to pay a hefty amount to use the insurance. This case is not as durable as stated. Shock absorption should have been way better. I would attach pictures, but I don't have a back up phone."
These suck. Didn't even stick to my screen.
It was wonderful
Overall product is very nice and appears to be well made.  I have owned this product for about 3 months with no issues.  Sound quality is very good once you make sure you have the right size ear buds on to completely fit in your ear.  I would buy this product again.
LOVE THE PRODUCT
Very good and light no bulk added to phone
Love it. Very cute
Received on time and as described. Will use again.
Looks great. Great cover for the price.
The charger charges fast and the recharges your devices fast.  Great product.
"Simple design works well and clips your phone quickly and easily. Despite what some have said, it does swivel to hold a phone vertically which is how I use it, so I can see more of the route ahead of me.<br /><br />Update: I liked the product functionality initially, but after 2 years, both units I ordered have failed...the first one failed in the first year and the other one in the second year. The plastic just breaks apart and the rotating portion separates from the base and it's useless."
Horrible. Dislike the product.
Saved my phone!
super technology at its best.
Great product!
What can I say besides misleading it appears to be 2 pieces and it says often bought with the USB chargers that are also 2 pieces!  I should have read the reviews which I normally do but I didn't think I would get 1 CHARGER port!  I'm sure they knew they were being deceiving ! As for as as the quality I don't know I'm just pissed I only received one piece!
"I bought this for my trip to Europe this summer. It seemed to charge in the sun the first time I left it out, and actually quicker than I expected, considering it was only getting a little light.  Since then, I have yet to get any solar charge. I placed it on my windowsill for a few days now and it hasn't charged at all. Definitely disappointed, especially since I planned on giving this to my boyfriend for his camping trips."
"Working like a charm for all networks in Saudi Arabia, excellent small and long battery life, Loved it"
Good but bulky
"I was skeptical at first, trusting my phone to these bags, but I'll be damned, it worked perfectly. So long as you set up a hardware button on your phone for snapping pictures, you can take underwater photos and videos all day long.<br /><br />Remember a few things if going in the ocean:<br />1. Open your camera/video app before entering the water (Capacitive screens do not work underwater)<br />2. Assign a hardware button to snap a picture/start recording<br />3. Put your phone in Airplane mode. You won't get any signal underwater anyway."
Great little case
Great protection for my new Iphone
Really useful to have the choice of lengths. Slow to charge.
it leaves a ghosting edges all around the phone
My daughter loves it! I love it cause it durable and fits great on her phone.
It doesn't work. The cord was disconnected. Rip off
I wish it could hold more cards without it getting so stiff. Also the magnet could be a little stronger. Aside from that I really love this wallet case! Saves me from carrying a huge bulky wallet in one pocket and my huge phone wit it's otterbox case in the other!
So nice to have a multi-usb port to use. We have several products that use the usb cords to charge so this is perfect for my family. I received this product free or at a discount for my unbiased review.
Good sound.
"The wi-fi is grayed out and will not reset. I am not able to use wi-if whatsoever, therefore I have gone above my data allowance on my cell plan, costing me even more money. The apps continuously &#34;glitch&#34; out and will not stay up on my screen to use. The phone randomly &#34;pixelizes&#34; if you will, fades out, the phone then freezes for a couple of minutes, then the phone shuts itself off. I can not turn it back on for a few minutes, which has been a problem as I had been using it atbthe time. Please note, the phone did not have any other apps running at the time and was not hot or overheated when this happened. I realize this is an older phone model, however I still expect it to work properly as advertised when I bought it."
Good.
Everything was as promised.  Thanks!
I love it. I have a 2ft one for my car and 6ft one for home. Works great and is stylish at the same time!
Doesn't work don't waste ur money
"The USB Charger RAVPower 24W 4.8A was a great buy for the money. With it pushing 24 watts of power and the dual 2.4 amp ports, it was just what I needed to charge up my ipad and iphone in a short amount of time. If you're looking for a fast charger at a great price, look no further."
"very good screen protector, very easy to clean."
"Excellent Product for the price, very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone!"
"Love the Qualcomm technology.  The ONLY reason I'm knocking it one star is because it doesn't clearly state that it doesn't come with a cable (or, I'm just that dumb and did't see it) but it is great to have the ability to quick-charge my phone in house and now in car.  I'm using an old Motorola cable and it has no issues.  My Samsung Galaxy Note 4 charges in less than an hour.  So handy if you are on your phone a lot."
Looks really nice and it also protects my apple.
"As many others have posted, this does not seat correctly on the edges of a Nexus 6.  It looked terrible but I kept it on for 6 weeks because I didn't have the opportunity to order an alternative. I finally took it off when dirt was building up around the edges because it was lifted off the screen."
Horrible! didn't last 3 days of use.
Hi quality case
One star deduction for my own effort to file a small notch on the armband case to be able to fully insert my earpod jack on the phone. Completely satisfied with the rest.
Bottom line this product did not work.  It would not charge my phone through case.  I also put a fully charged phone in the case and charged the both.  when i woke up the next morning the case had take the charge from the phone.
Love this case!  Makes it so easy to keep my DL and debit card with me at all times without having to carry a purse everywhere. And it is made strong and durable. Would recommend it to anyone!
"good value, made well"
Works just as described. Easy to apply.
"Love this case! The looks is classy and elegant, albeit bulkier than I like, and does the job well. I constantly get compliments of this case. It's unique. Other than the bulk, I wasn't crazy about the fact it cannot be removed without breaking it...or I haven't figured out how to do it! That isn't enough to make me not love it, and it forces me to use my iPod (which has been useless since I bought a lighting adapter to use apps like waze and pandora in my car). I constantly drop my phone (never in a way that wouldn't harm a phone, always from a high place and usually on concrete/rocks/cobblestone...I know, why not learn to be more careful OR get a lifeproof case, not my style). My phone has been dropped MULTIPLE times over the past 10 days while on vacation in a foreign country (and honestly the last thing I want to buy is something practical, or a cell phone case I don't even like). It had a couple of bits on the bottom near the charging/headphone ports come off after 2-3 traumatic falls, but my phone was still in tact with no scrapes/scratches.<br /><br />This case is fantastic! Yes, it broke. Yes, I have to replace it...and I'm replacing it with the same exact case. Why? Because I didn't have to but some random, ultra ugly case for an exorbitant price (that may or may not actually protect my phone), and I would do it again over and over to avoid replacing my phone...which costs significantly more than this case. I'm just sayin'.<br /><br />This is my first review on any product. That is how strongly I feel that it's worth purchasing (if you don't mind not being able to take off the case -which technically doesn't bother me because I now use the iPod I bought so I don't have to listen to the radio) or the bulk (also not a deal breaker for me since it's stylish enough and the size of the iPhone 6 forces me to actually carry a purse larger than a wristlet anyway)."
order these for middle schooler. he needed them for school. They are very nice and expensive looking and worked perfectly. I am ordering a second pair for home use when he is using his laptop and iPad
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
I've had a couple of screen protectors for my Note 4 and this is the best so far.  It does have a gap around the edges but that is necessary due to the curvature of the screen
Was amazing simple to program too!
"im writing this review because I know full well that this unit is by no means a 'luxury item'. It is not the crime de la crime of car DVD players. So that is my basis of comparison and why I've given it four stars.<br /><br />The bad: Formfactor is very cheap feeling and seems fragile. When you handle the unit, it creaks like a scary movie. Yes, the plastic literally creaks when you flex the unit. Also, if you are using this with kiddos, and you're the only other one in the car...navigating DVD menus is obviously difficult.<br /><br />The good: the unit plays DVDs very well and doesn't skip on bumpy roads. The volume coming out of it is sufficient to defeat road noise in a battle of wits...but we also plugged the player into the car's sound system, which worked well. The player is very easy to take in and out of the car as well.<br /><br />Overall...GREAT unit for the money. awesome value."
My product stopped working only after 5 weeks . To late to return. :(
Just as described A+
"After purchasing many brands and types of screen protectors over the years, Maxboost HD glass screen protectors will be the only screen protectors I will ever buy from now on. Extremely easy to apply as long as you follow the simple directions and have a few minutes of patience to get it straight. Currently we only have two iPhones with this screen protector on them for almost a year now. Neither has yet to show any signs of scratches or chipping, even after one too many accidental falls and hits. It has never shown any issues with the touch screen functionality, nor any lifting around the edges. If applied properly, you would never know it was there. Major perk buying one on Amazon is the price and lifetime warranty that you get. Buying any brand (plastic or glass) screen protector from your local store, starts out at around $25 and up. Save your money and protect your phone with the Maxboost brand on here!!!"
This little charger can be used so two devices can be charged at the same time. Very convenient for people always on the go.  Compact and actually works. Sleek design.
3 Months later and it's dead. Just quit working. And since it has been more than 30 days I can't return or even exchange it. Horrible. Do not buy.  **EDIT** Soon after I left a one star review the company reached out to me. They have sent me a new portable charger at no cost. I changed the rating on the review based on the the level of customer service.  Very excellent customer service. Hopefully this charger lasts longer than 3 months!
It never worked the red light came on but it never  charged the battery a piece of crap . Only gave a star because I had to.
Works great
Arrived in two days.  Good quality charger
the talk button stick.....and it makes noise like griding sound
Had this case for over two months and I still love it.  Enough space for up to three credit cards in each slot.  Stylus is easy to access for me.
Better build quality than Apples own plus much less in price. Highly recommend.
Awesome case
"This case is awesome. The colors are a great combination that you just don't see together very often. I love that the case came with a stylus, that matched the case. The stylus is nice & thick, so it's easier to hold onto than some others that I have had in the past. My phone fits in the case very well. I will say that at first, the case is rather stiff, however, I was able to get it more pliable once I bent it and worked where it folds quite a bit. That didn't take too long, either! There are many times that I don't want to have to carry my purse or wallet with me when I'm going into the store, so I'll take my money & put it in the case, along with any cards that I might need, and that's great! I can NOT get my phone to fall out of the case, and I have tried, hard, it just won't come out! I did notice that if you place too many bills in the case, it won't close properly, because you do have to fold the bills in half, but I try not to have too many on me at once anyways, so it's not really a problem with me. I am able to carry 2 credit cards (or my credit card and ID should I need my ID - I still get ID'ed to buy alcohol, which is awesome) and my money also. The clasp, that holds the case together, will also attach to the back should you need to make a phone call or something, that way it's not getting in the way while you're trying to talk. The case also came with a carrying strap, which attaches to the case by a lobster claw, and it's a lime green that matches the clasp and the inside of the case!<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
These screen protectors look good but they don't fit the Fire phone exactly correct and cause issues with the phone screen. They look like they should work but with all of the camera sensors on the face of the phone they just don't work. Save your money. They look as good as any screen protector they just don't work on this phone.
"Works well, but sometimes you have to talk loudly."
"Works great, so far it's holding up better than other chargers I've had. I'd definitely recommend this or another braided jacket cable. That alone helps them hold up better"
Better than the ones Verizon &#34;gave&#34; me...
"Love my case and I receive so many compliments on it. The only thing I have to say is that with in a few days some areas started to chip. Other than that, Iove this case and it has been on my phone for a little over a month now."
Very good audio system
Very pleased real quality don't fuss with those plastic screen protectors this one blows all the plastic ones away.
Nicely made.
Amazing
Great product and works great.
The solemate met my expectations. Decent sound and volume for close quarters.
Great product to put on the tablet to ensure it is protected and also has a nice stand on it so it can be propped up.
No good broke in 1 week
Don't waste your time. It's less than 60 days old and will not hold a charge.
Nice
Here we are five years after I bought this phone and I'm still using it as a back-up. It's been all over the world and keeps on ticking like it was brand new!
great case. handed the phone down to my son and he still has it on the phone.
Still working good. I think this one is better quality than what samsung uses.
"Perfect fit for my iPhone 4S. BEST PRICE TOO. this is my 3rd one to order, one for me mom and kids!"
"The product seems to work as advertised.  The red dot in the magnet is rubber and provides friction on the smooth ball bearing when it sticks, that's how your phone stays in place.  The magnet stuck to the back of my phone very well but the ball bearing mount did not stick to the dash of my truck.  I have a Tundra and the dash surface is a bit rough so the 3m sticky pad provided with the purchase didn't stick.  After the first one didn't stick I tried a second sticky pad and it stuck for maybe 15 minutes.  I'm currently working with the manufacturer to come up with a solution. If you have a 'somewhat' smooth dash this product would work great."
I love this case. I have a 3year old and she has dropped my phone a few times. She even threw it and there was not even a mark on the case let alone the phone. Its a great case for a great price.
"Better quality than the originals, extremely happy with color selection and quality"
Excellent all-around product with great pricing and shipping time frame actions.
Excellent
"The case fits perfectly. I have no trouble using the lock and volume buttons or plugging in the lightning and audio cables. I like the silicone edging which should help absorb the shock of a fall/drop. There are sturdier cases available, but they look very industrial; this one shows off the phone while still offering some protection."
Not the greatest sound.
"Really like this case, it does what it's supposed to do and has saved my phone a couple of times since I received it."
"This is ridiculous the band weighs over three times what the watch does. If Skagen made the bands and Apple the watch you would have, close, to the perfect product."
"Works well, is durable. Sound quality isn't the best but it definitely gets the job done as a good shower speaker."
I love the thickness of the wire and the length!
"The phone is water proof, until parts of it start falling off and breaking. I have had this case less than 30 days and the flip out that covers my stylus broke the 2nd day that I had it. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
not what I was looking for
It doesn't work with my tablet.
"So happy with the glass cover. I had a lifeproof case on my iPhone for two years while I was under contract but it was pretty beat. I wanted to keep my phone and get a new case and screen protector. I love it it's so clear not big and test I have dropped my phone and the glass isn't cracked. The phone is good and the screen protector is still perfect. This is my new go to product when I do decide to upgrade. The only downside, is on the iPhone 6 there is a space between the screen protector and the edge of the case. I'm hoping they will update and fix that"
Worked very well
Works great
gran estuche ! si que resiste golpes y mal trato
Good quality at the price.
"I tried to use this to connect my iPhone 6 to a Bose sound dock with the old-style connector.  Not only did it not work, but when I tried to disconnect it the adapter broke into three separate pieces. I cut my hand and bled all over it. Then I had to remove it from the sound dock with pliers. I'm just glad it didn't break the bose or my phone.  Avoid this at all costs."
Easy to apply screen protector
This case is very well made and I will definitely be using it often! Has a great seal and a beautiful color. I won't worry about having it near the pool or taking it to the amusement park.
It was a really comfortable fit but I couldn't hear anything that was coming over the walkie which is kind of the point.
"I bought the 16 GB and 2 gb ram, and it´s a pain in the neck, I´m coming from a nexus 5 with 2gb of ram and the difference is huge, the zenfone 2 got stuck if you´re actively using 2 apps ex: Google music and Facebook, the ram usage is almost all of the time over the 90% causing Lag, the OS drains really fast the battery(8 hours per charge) and that is really bad for a 3000 battery, and finally the latest update 40.61 bricked my cellphone(not rooted or modified), I have to say if you want this phone go for the 64GB and 4 gb ram because the 2 gb ram is a real pain in the neck..."
Scratched very easy
Great product.
Too heavy to carry on...:-(
I love it
I ordered the Samsung galaxy s4 screen with digitizer the first one sent the screen wasn't working upon testing and it looks fake like a knock off so I asked for a replacement the second one is also defective it won't even turn on but when I put my old original screen my phone turns on . this is crazy .
"Doesnt charge beyond 2nd light, defected, and doesnt come with cable for charging! Very disappointed"
I love my Argon Technologies Bluetooth Wireless speaker. Its seemlessly connects to my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and my iPad. The sound coming from this little device is large and clear. Great product for the price.
"If you are planning on using this cord with an Otterbox Case, it won't work."
"I always purchase Finite for all my devices, tablets and phones. Well made and lightweight."
Very attractive looking product. It is extremely easy to use. Works perfectly as an alternative for the original Samsung battery. The charger is a no brainer; charges original Samsung battery very fast (do not expect it to do it in five minutes).
"I bought 3 of these cables, to have one for home, office and car.  Two of the 3 have stopped working, and are no longer able to charge my iphone.  They worked for a few months, then died.  There is no apparent damage on outside of the cable, so i don't think it is dead to abuse.  They just stop working from normal wear and tear after a few months."
Brought my phone back from the dead. Very happy with the time it took for delivery
super
"Fits phone perfectly.  Two piece set which can be intermixed with other colors of same product.  Bright colors, stones stay on back of case very well.  Great case"
Good price
Item worked great.
Works great
"Decent product, especially considering the price.  Membrane doesn't fit tight over the edges, but brace does hold everything in place.if not for that, would have given 5 stars."
"Dang, this is a thick and sturdy screen cover. It's probably about 2mm thick, and it's not the slightest bit flexible. It's pretty much an extra glass screen.<br /><br />There are several things I like about this screen protector. What I like best is that it came with a guide to help put it on. Basically, you create a hinge out of some stickers and flip the protector onto the screen like a cover on a book. That made it so much easier and less nerve-wracking - plus, no worries about bubbles under the screen protector! From there, its own weight pushes it down and seals it onto the iPhone.<br /><br />The screen protector also does not get in the way of a case, and it's smear and stain resistant. It's always easy to wipe it off. It hasn't smudged or scratched once, and the sides do not collect dirt like other screen protectors I've seen.<br /><br />I like this a lot."
Love
"Just got a new iPhone 6 and had to replace all of my old power cords for my 4S. Needed multiple cords to stage in car, office, bedroom, etc, etc. I tried multiple other vendors but was shocked to see how almost all of them didn't work or failed shortly after I got them. Tech Armor you can tell is of much greater quality. It's used in my office through my desk and gets yanked and stretched daily, but is the best cord I have. Highly recommended."
Daughter loves it.  She picked it.
This is better mobile phone in this price
I've tried many cases. This is by far the most durable and best case.
"I am definitely satisfied with this product. The first time I used this was when I had a long road trip. I thought it will only last 10hrs, but the battery can be used almost a day which includes texting, calls, watching, surfing, playing. It really makes me enjoy my phone much better and longer comparing to the original Samsung battery I had. This saves me a lot of ways in a very good price. The case also fits very well and very good looking. Highly recommendable. Five star!"
Error size
"I was quite excited to get a wireless speaker because I use one every morning at work.  I am currently lugging around a rather large speaker because most smaller ones aren't loud enough and/or sound rough.  I don't want to invest a lot of money into a speaker that may get broken at work.<br /><br />Upon arrival it was in a nice thick plastic case.  The accessories, a charging cable and a cable to plug a device directly in, were hidden beneath the speaker.  I immediately plugged it in to charge and was surprised to hear it announce that it was charging.  I like this feature because sometimes I don't know when a device has connected to my speaker.  It also announces when the battery is getting low.<br /><br />A nice feature is the ability to put an SD card in.  I don't always have the battery on my devices to use up so having a back up SD card filled with my music will come in handy.<br /><br />The speaker does get a little distorted when the volume is maxed out but taking it back down a bit helps.  I find this to happen on most speakers but it still is very loud for it's size.<br /><br />It was rather easy to use.  I didn't need to read the directions but the only downfall is that the battery only lasts about 3 hours.  That is a big difference to the 10 hours that it claims to last.  I don't mind on most days but if I have an overnight shift this speaker wont work for me.  The price point is exceptional for the quality and it's a durable speaker.<br /><br />I recieved this speaker in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
I was thinking this was a protective case which would cover the entire phone. What I got is just a snap on cover for the back of my phone which does not offer any protection.
I am very pleased with this wireless charger.. It works great.
Great combo deal here. Chargers work great and now I don't have to bring the charger in and out of the car to home and back again
I love the case. Also it came a day early so yay(:
"just like an otterbox, without paying $$$ for it. Dropped phone plenty of times, didn't break or damage the case."
Took this with us on vacation to take pictures under water and didn't work.  Ended the life of my iPhone
Product came with a toxic smell .I tried  washing it but the smell would not come out had to be thrown away
"Fit just like it should, the black matte color makes the phone more classy & easier to hold."
GREAT HEADPHONES!!! Honestly.
"I've had this on my phone for a year, I rarely remove it. My phone is in like new condition because of this case, its the best case I've ever owned for any phone.<br /><br />If I had to choose a con, it would be that it makes a large phone slightly larger and boxier, but that wont matter when you realize your phone is in perfect condition every time you remove it."
Works well and the replacement tips make it a worthy investment.
My husband liked it it helped his phone  a lot
"These work well. However, I have had a great deal of trouble keeping them in place in my ears.I wish they had a hook for your ears."
Just what I needed. thanks for the good customer service.
"Nice, light weight, convenient, gives an extra charge to my iphone (note that you will need an adapter to be able tu use it with an iphone as this comes with a micro USB plug)."
nice product
Great
"I tried the OEM quick circle case for the LG G4- way too slippery in my hand.  I kept feeling like I was going to drop it.  This one has a texture that makes it feel more secure in your hand and much easier to grab.  The case is shaped correctly for the phone and closed very securely every time yet opens easily.  It''s holding up well, looks great, fits perfectly, and at $15 is a much better value than the $50 OEM case for the G4.  I just wish they made it in more colors.  I'd buy another.  I only wish the quick circle cases had a plastic cover instead of an open window but that's the style and it works."
didn't fit well
I love the length ....
This case Has no way to properly apply it to the phone without scratching it. I could t even use or return it to get my money back. Piece of crap.
"works great, thank you for the fast shipping"
"Fits well, but was hard to put on correctly. I enjoy the protection of the case."
I got promo code for leaving fair review. great deal!
Got here a little later than I expected but it was worth the wait
good product original
Great deal on multi colored charms. They hold up well and don't break too easily. Lots of bold colors in the mix.
"My iPhone did not come with a charger for my car.  The iPhone battery runs down so fast that I needed something I could use while I was traveling. This not only works great, it is also attractive.  Sure is nice to not have to dig out that ugly bunch of wires to hook up my old one.  I just leave this one plugged in so that is always handy."
Came damage didn't even get the chance to use!
"For the first week, it was working well but after the first week, it keeps disconnecting from the phone. It disconnects from my phone at most 10 minutes after I connect it. I am using it just as a watch. It's not as smart as it claims to be."
"Fits my phone perfectly and not mention, protects my phone as well"
I am very happy with my purchase.
There is a ton of capacity. Charges other devices fast. Takes a long time to get the device charged due to the high capacity.
It got here a lot earlier than expected and it's super cute. But my phone wiggles around in the case it doesn't fit well at all.
Is good unit. Loud speaker.
"This item holds the phone for a selfie, but does not come with any means to take the picture from afar... uggh"
"Love it!! Perfect size, awesome design, very practical, and perfect fit."
Kool color for Kristie
Great case!
"Very good headphones for the price.  I use it for listening to music at work and video chat.  So far so good, I have no idea how long they will last!"
"I've reviewing quite a few usb charging systems over the year and as far as pure speed this one topped them all. Since I have no quick charge 2.0 compatible devices I tested it on my OnePlus One smartphone and noticed an overall 10% increase of charge speeds over my usual high speed charger, and over 100% faster than a normal usb charger.<br /><br />Quick stats:<br />Turbo Charger from Iclever: 2000 mah<br />My speedy hootoo usb faster charger: 1900 mah<br />Normal usb charger: 1000 mah<br /><br />This is a personally recommended item."
returned wouldnt read sim card - nothing against the model - ordered a replacement
Disappointed! The pictures says sparkly bling case no I received a dull picture case it's not as described it ugly and I will not be ordering from u guys again
"Love it. Great clear image. And the case is sturdy as while. Only one problem, the button above the power button is so hard that I can't push it and have to shut my phone off another way. Besides that, this is a wonderful item."
Love  it
Fit my Motorola Droid Razar M Well.......Good cover for the price. I will probably order another one in a different color.
I LOVE THIS CASE! I get so much use out of it and all of my friends love it and think its so funny. It fits the ipod perfectly . I love it
just what i was looking for
I highly recommend reviewing the youtube video prior to installation and prep work and thorough cleaning is the key to perfection.  This was my first time ever doing this and my application went ever better than the one shown in the video. It adhered completely to every edge without a single bubble...amazing!  I would definitely recommend this screen protector and will be buying the smartphone version soon since the current one I have was installed by a &#34;professional&#34; who didn't take the time to clean properly.
"i bought this charger last year but rarely used it, I think I had only recharged it to full 3 times and used it to charge my Samsung phone less than 10 times throughout the year. Now it's so dead wont charge nor being charged. Huge shame it is really piece of junk and what the manufacturer is doing to the environment producing these junk  Update: after previous review Anker sales contacted me immediately and sent a replacement. The replacement works so far and I hope it won't  fail after few use again. They also addressed my concern about the disposal of the faulty one, they paid postage to ship back the faulty piece. I am happy with how I was treated and update my review here"
Definitely protects. I've dropped my phone few times and it's safe. It is bulky so some may not like that feature. I don't mind
fast shipping works great
"After 2 years, my Fre model case was falling apart.  The rubber was tearing around the sides, the switch tab for the mute switch broke, and the plastic on both the front and back was warping from the heat of the phone.  I wanted a waterproof case, so I figured I would try the Nuud model.  The case seems much better than the Fre case with a more rigid back.  The use of a stick-on screen protector instead of the Fre cover is a world of improvement over screen viewing ability as well as touch control.  The raised edge around the screen takes just a bit to get used to, but it it certainly beefy enough to maintain a good seal against the surface of the phone.  I have no intention of getting the phone wet, so this case is just-in-case protection and appears that it will handle the task well."
Delivered fast and charges everything fast.
"I saw more than a dozen people at Great America with this waterproof case, and had to have it! This was perfect foe Hurricane Harbor !"
This case fits like a glove. The phone sits in the case like it is supposed to and it doesn't feel flimsy or anything. The rubber part of the case gives a better feel on the phone and helps with the grip while the plastic part helps with the protection.
I like very much. Graphics are great. Fits great to my phone. Textured case gives it a nice feel. Would buy it again for sure.
Great looking case! Allows the phone aesthetics to truly shine and the case fit perfectly. I feel like my phone is well protected from any possible drops. Would definitely recommend for those who want a non-bulky and durable case.
"It's a pretty decent stick, the pole could be a bit heavier made, but for under $8, cant beat it."
perfect fit! adds additional protection to my sapphire screen.
They work great!  Love how it came with all the different chargers.
"Great case fpr me.  Most of the time I carry my phone in my pocket and the aluminum is light, thin and protective.  Perfect."
"Not sure if I got a defective one or not, but takes very long to charge and runs out very quick."
Love it! Very light and sturdy. I recommend
amazing - love it - i never speed - my 88 year old mother tells me I am a hazard because I drive too slow. I like knowing where the &#34;hot spots&#34; are. Great value!
works great
works great. Bought it to power my phone when used as a GPS. It provides more than enough power.
"Great, better than the original"
I love having this power charger!  Does a great job charging my Droid turbo !
Excellent product!!
"My case was busted within a week of owning it. The screen protector separated from the rest of the case while I was taking it off of my phone, which totally ruined the waterproof aspect of the case. Turns out it was just a tiny dab of glue holding it in place to begin with.<br />Certainly not &#34;life proof&#34; as it broke before I even dropped it. Waste of money. Will return and buy a competitor's brand."
Absolutely love. Received my order faster than expected too. Exactly like the picture and fits my Note 4 perfectly.
"It does so much, more than they tell you in the description. Not to mention it's a handsome watch. I look at it quite a bit, and still go a full day without charging. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars was no speaker for wrist phone calls a la James Bond."
Its a nice armband. Stitching is done well too.
Works great. Can't beat the price.
"Reliable adhesion to the windshield, different angels for display. Like it!"
"I love this case. I wanted something that wasn't colorful because I like the look of the iPhone6. The rubber around the edges is perfect for having a good grip on my phone. Before using this case I was constantly concerned with dropping my new phone. I couldn't hold it in one hand without it slipping out, but now I can get a good handle of it. It also allows you access to all the buttons, switches, etc. I would recommend this case."
I love this case! It's durable and stylish
Good product... Thanks
This case didn't even fit it was so bad
"I used all summer, super good."
Very good on my Mexican Telcel.
Works great in the car. Very clean sound from my iPods
"Really great stylus.  I especially like the more narrow tip.  One small disadvantage when compared with a broader-tipped stylus is that I have to press and hold the &#34;back arrow&#34; on the lower-right of the device to get it to work (this is a Galaxy Note 4).  With the broader-tipped stylus, it was more of just a tap.  Anyway, given the choice, I'll stick with these.  Oh, and I also like the included replacement tips."
Nice very nice
Nice phone!
So far good and reliable
"Works great! It's designed to fit well over the phone and has excellent protection all around, it prevents my phone from water and dirt and doesn't affect my phone usage so overall great product. A unique design, thank to seller!"
It came to me broke like wtf
Perfect for the upgrade.
Excellent
Great when using GPS works great you can read you screen with no problem and 100% waterproof my phone had never gotten wet
"BIG LESSON: I live in Hawaii and I already got my iPhone 6+ wet (without no protection) when I went off to Samoa for work. Always have some sort of water proof casing for ANY phone or precious belonging you own !<br /><br />Now that I am back in Hawaii and living exactly in front of the beach and it being hurricane season, it was definitely a MUST HAVE to buy some sort of waterproof casing for my new iPhone 6+ (since it got water damage in my other phone). I was not willing to spend over $70 for a Life Proof case. I have heard many bad reviews about that case from my roommates and friends that have that case and I ended up finding this one instead. For a BIG fraction of the price, I can definitely say that is 100% better than having a life proof case. (I bought mine for 9.99).<br />After I received this case, I followed the instructions that were sent in my email about testing it out. I left a napkin in the case overnight in a bowl of water. The following morning, I took out the napkin and it was completely dry inside!<br />So I went to the beach that same day and put my new phone in the case and into the water. I swam out in the ocean, did a bit of snorkeling with the phone and the case and by 1.5 hour of being in the ocean, my phone still ended up completely dry. This case doesn't block the camera in the different directions you put it in and it still takes nice quality pictures. I tried talking on the phone and using the finger sensor on my iPhone, but it wasn't really that great. But if you are ever going to be a body of water<br />Quality wise, it is very durable and easy to wipe clean. I absolutely love this product and I would definitely repurchase this again. If you are contemplating on buying this or something else, I would highly recommend this product!"
"I changed to Garmin FR 225, after my Polar M400 failed to charge after 3 months working. I am very happy with this change. Following is my comparison to Polar M400:<br /><br />- Heart rate monitor: I had problem to use a heart rate trap, since it hurts my skin every time. I was skeptical to the build-in heart rate monitor of Garmin 225 at the beginning. After several times of using, I am very happy with it. It indeed gives accurate heart rate measure. Of course one should carry the watch as it is required. Otherwise it can have large error.<br /><br />- Charge: Someone complains the charge connection of Garmin 225 for not using USB. But if I compare it with Polar M400, which connects the watch with a micro-USB, I would say the Garmin 225 connection is much superior. The montage of the connector is very convenient, I don't need to use one of my finger to hold the rubber-cover of the USB, while the other fingers are holding the watch, as I did for Polar M400. The Garmin 225 charge is much more robust, reliable and convenient.<br /><br />- GPS signal: To find the GPS is faster with Garmin 225 than Polar M400. It takes usually a few secs, without need to keep the hand still, as Polar M400 always requires.<br /><br />- Elevation measurement: Gamin 225 measures elevation more accurate than Polar M400. Polar M400 has a granularity of 5m. If I run the same way back, I get for instance an ascending 55m and descending 65m. Garmin 225 is accurate to 1m, and I get the same ascending and descending for the same road back.<br /><br />- Cadence: Cadence is a very useful information which Polar M400 misses. One can improve the running technique based on it. Yet Polar M400 provides the running index which I don't see with Garmin 225. Although it can be used to predict the race pace somehow, it is just like a magic number and gives no hints for the running technique.<br /><br />- Environment information: it is very useful that Garmin 225 gives information like the temperature and wind speed/direction. The only thing I am missing with Garmin Connect is that I am not able to expand the map to the full browser.<br /><br />Yet Garmin 225 is not perfect. I find a serious error in the number of best pace. For instance, I run a slow running with average pace 7:40min/km. From the chart I can see my peak pace at 5min/km. I can't image how it is possible that Garmin 225 shows my max. pace with 2:44min/km. For this I would reduce the rate of the watch by half point. Hope this is just a software error and can be corrected in future versions.d speed/direction.

I live it. Just what I expected. Came sooner then expected😊
"These things are wonderful.  We have at least 6 now, one in each car along with a few around the house.  The flashlight is very bright and works great!  When I need a flashlight I look for one of these before any of the other flashlights I have.  These are particularly useful when camping.  Use the flashlight in the evening then plug it into your phone to charge it back up over night.  In the morning we recharge them from the car and they are ready to go again for the next night."
When installed following instructions its prefect! Had one for 2 years not a single scratch.
This was not a genuine Samsung product and stopped working correctly after a few uses.
This is an excelent radio fits perfect it was exactly what i was looking for
It will protect your phone from numerous dangers and fits in your pocket easily. Easily recommend to a friend
I didn't like this phone case at all.
Great case. It fit well and isn't a bulky as previous defender cases
"This influence bank is justified regardless of the cash you spent. I utilize it to charge my iphone 5s and it effectively charges it 2.5 times before getting depleted out. The DUAL USB Feature helps me to charge two gadgets together. Sunlight based Charging Facility can be made utilization when emmergency, cool device."
This is a perfect replacement for my camera lens on the iPhone 9. I got the silver and the color matches perfectly. The lens cover is well made and and is a perfect replacement. The glass is very clear and once installed you can not even tell it was not the one that came on the iPhone 6.<br /><br />So people know this takes a little work that most people may not want to do themselves. You will need to remove the back cover of the phone which is not that easy to do and it can break really easy. Watch this video before you attempt to replace the lens cover on you iPhone 6:<br />[...]. It can be done but takes some time and a lot of patience. I was able to replace mine but it took me about 30 minutes.
works good
Fit and performed perfectly. Definitely recommend.
"the cables look like USB 3.0, but they aren't. I connected my cell phone to my Computer and didn't get the Use USB 3 message."
It serves its purpose.
I love the privacy look.
I purchased this to work with an old polycom unit I had from the 90's.  It works perfectly and now I can use the Polycom for my long conference calls with multiple people in the room.
Excellent quality and 100% iPhone compatible.
works welll!
"I tried one then went and bought 3 more for my kids' cars. so much better than suction cup devices or gluing something to your dash. Although designed for a phone without a case, they work fine with LifeProof and other cases. Horizontal or vertical and with power cable plugged in. I can now use the iPhone with Waze(r) as my primary GPS, in place of my bulky, outdated Garmin GPS that I can retire.<br /><br />Small, lightweight but does the trick. Seems solid and clever way to hold your phone."
"I've recently upgraded from my old 3 year old? Note 2 which was a great phone, but it started to get slow this year and I knew I had to upgrade. After watching a few YouTube videos I felt that this phone was the fastest on the market when it comes to multitasking (which I do a lot.) It's been about a month since I bought the One M9 and all I can say is &#34;impressive, fluent, unique, and beautiful&#34; the fastest phone I've ever held, the longest battery life I've ever seen, it's durable, loud, vivid and eye catching. Everything you could want in a phone even if you are an iOS or Windows OS user :)"
"I loved these headphones great sound ni cracks with volume up all the way, but they just stopped working today no more than 10 min ago. Nothing happened I unplugged them then when I plugged them back in 10-15 min later nothing. So so so so very disappointed."
"Save your money. The cut out does not match the Note 5. The sides are cut crooked, the top and botom is cut short so there are lots of space. Very poor quality. Very disappointed since their Note 4 screen protector was well cut."
"THIS IS THE ONLY PHONE MOUNT THAT MATTERS.  SLEEK , STRONG and USEFUL.  Portrait or landscape.  All phone sizes.  Just stick the magnet on the back of your case (not the back of your phone) and  you're set.  A+"
love it
"This phone is another Samsung slam dunk. However, it never got LTE for T-Mobile in the US. I don't know if all unlocked phones are going to have this problem. I really liked this phone and all of the features. If you're ok with not being able to get 4G than this will work for you.  Great phone and it's very unique. Would definitely buy again if I knew that I could get the speed that 4G LTE has."
VERY BAD I USE IT ONLY 2 WEEKS
Not five months old and it sucks.
"I've only had the case for a few weeks and the leather/bumper are already separating...I'm not sure if that's supposed to happen or not. I can see where over time the bottom near the plug will become fragile and break. For someone like me who uses her phone a LOT, this case won't make it. I do like how it has good protection but it's rather bulky...nothing like an Otter box but def increases the size.  The gold and black leather are pretty but I don't think I'll buy this case again. The struggle to find sleek, think, cell phone protection continues."

"Nice and compact and works as described. Only used three items at once so far, but no problems."
"Omg I love this case . Seriously the absolute best best best best case ever. The only thing I could say is that I wish they had some that had designs or sayings or something, otherwise this is the best case I've ever bought. I don't have to carry my phone and a wallet."
Great
Doesn't look like the pic at all. But the case itself is good.
"I received this product with a great discount for an honest review.<br /><br />Easy to connect to my laptop and my cell phone, I was really happy with the range on these headphones. I was able to walk around almost my entire bungalow and listen to the radio streaming on the laptop.<br /><br />I did have some difficulty getting the headphones to seat in one of my ears. The device comes with several different sizing options but for whatever reason, I ended up irritating my ear before finding the optimal angle.<br /><br />The charge was quick, and lasted long enough for my cleaning session (or for a workout), and I think these are an excellent choice for bluetooth headphones intended for use for limited lengths of time."
Do not buy..  Phone was advertised as unlocked.  Don't believe it!!!!!  Said I could contact Huawei to unlock bootloader. That's false too. Wish I could return and buy a phone with support. Stuck on 4.3 and No OTA in future yet Amazon is still selling this phone knowing some of your apps will never work cause the phone is no longer supported.
Worked fine for 9-10 months before the regular port stopped working. Outside of warranty. Oh well.  ***UPDATE 9/13*** Anker customer service contacted me with 2-3 days of writing my Amazon review and we were able to come to agree on a resolution. I received a replacement product within 4-5 days and it works great so far.
Battery only last about 1 1/2 hr.<br />Great sound but battery doesn't last the 5 hrs it said that it does
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
I ordered these for my mother in law. They came very quick and she was very happy with them. Easy to apply and awesome quality!
"Outstanding item.  I've bought 2.<br /><br />If you have a phone case, you can easily adhere the (thin) metal plate to the inside of the case, if you are worried about applying it directly to your phone.  The magnet (that clips to your air vent) is strong enough to make it through your case.  I have a semi-thick plastic case on mine and it works great enough to hold the phone in either straight-up or landscape, without problem.  In addition, in straight-up position, the magnet is strong enough to hold the phone while plugged in for charging as well.  I use it in my car and carry an extra magnet in my bag for travel (for rental cars).  Works so well.<br /><br />Would only suggest not to use this if you keep your credit cards in your phone case, for obvious (magnetic) reasons.  But if you do not use your phone case for storage of your CC's.... this is an awesome product."
"Even though I have only had it for a couple hours, I am so obsessed with taking photos with it. There are literally no flaws! I love it, it stretches to probably like three feet!"
"Good battery life, just undependable Bluetooth. Couldn't get it to work reliably"
This is very good portable charger.  It is always ready to charge your portable devices -- simply plug in your USB cord and plug in your device and charging starts immediately.  It will easily charge your smart phone several times before it needs to be re-charged itself.  It will also charge an iPad or other tablet at least once before needing to be re-charged.
"I don't believe this hard cover case is for a Apple Touch 1st Gen.  The power switch opening is on the wrong side.  As others stated there is no volume openings on the left side. As far as the strength of the case, I can see where there can be some concerns ( but I have not drop it yet).  The reasons I gave it two stars was the screen is protected some what.  Finally, I do like the clear appearance.  If I could have seen it up close, I would not have purchased this case. I can't recommend this product."
"It's a film protector. I don't see it but I guess that means its doing its job, no scratches!"
The only thing I can say is That I now have a VERY HAPPY WIFE with this case and protector. It looks good and does not block the screen corners when she is playing her games on her new Samsung Galaxy tab S.  She is happy and I am happy. Thank God!
Does not work with the iPhone 6. It says the accessory is not supported. Useless
Perfect solution to replacement of battery in Galaxy 3 phone. Price is great and no issues with working right away.
was ok
The Camera works great! The cameraI was shipped on time. I love this camera and I also love the price!
excelente
My iPhone 6 Plus is too heavy for this selfie stick. I had to use tape to keep the metal rods in place so I could use it. :(
I liked this brand so much that I purchased another case for a different phone. It resembles the Outer Box.
The case was good quality and exactly as pictured.  A bargain for the price.
Exactly what I wanted and delivered on time.
love it.
This was a gift and the person loved it.
As promised
Love this - protects my phone like never before.
The screen arrived at my home broken.
These are the best out there. Could have been a bit more longer but then it might have been harder to hold it. Anyways quality product
Great basic speaker - love that I can use as both a light and the blu-tooth speaker. LED color is a very cool white (blue) so used more for speaker! Teen actually stole mine - this has been a hit for all ages. I received this at a deeply discounted price for my honest opinion.
Never worked. And feels cheap.
We love these headphones. We had a pair each for our 2 and 4 year old. They loved them and thought it was great that they could share one device but each have their own set of headphones. Very comfortable as well.
"Great product , works awesome in the right station"
"Its a fantastic gadget for the car. It is very easy to install and operate. The quality of the product is good. The markings in green, yellow and red while reversing really helps. It does not show the distance though but you will get used to it and develop judgement. The camera  is not freely rotating and needs to be set and fixed tight with the screws provided. Once you connect the power supply from the reverse tail light the camera and monitor (needs to be connected to 12V socket- cigarette lighter) switches on immediately very negligible delay. Overall a value for money gadget."
The product does not match the picture. I decided to buy this because from the picture it appeared to cover the entire screen with hole punches for home button and camera etc. It does not. It  is actually smaller than the screen protector I  replaced.  I paid more for this screen protector than the others on Amazon because the picture indicated full overlay. The fact is it  smaller than cheaper competitors.
"Nice case for the price, works great"
Perfect wall charger for iphones!  Would buy again.
LOVE MY NEW BLU PHONE..
Very poor quality!
Great product
Excellent protection for my phone. Trident makes one of the toughest cases on the planet.
Bought as a gift for my son-he loves it
"Charges device(s) quickly and efficiently, would buy again."
"Junk, lasted about four hours. Won't turn back on, hopefully they'll send me a new one, or money back"
It would not line up to snap together - very cheaply made.
Love it!
"it was advertised as being for an I phone 5c, not true"
love the colors
some time it does not work to connect the iPhone 6 to the PC.
Great product
Perfect. Just like the one I paid $30 at the T-Mobile store - just less expensive
By far the EASIEST screen protector to put on! It comes with everything--the wet wipe and microfiber cloth AND sticker duster helps make adhesion easy and quick with NO bubbles. Protects the screen and still makes it easy to swipe and touch as if nothing were on it at all.
Hanging on my Emma Fox bag as jewelry.So cute .Very sparkly.His little tail wiggles.Love him.
I needed a thin-tip stylus pen to highlight eTextbook lines in my Fire HD 6 and these work very well!
work really well in Haiti...charging all I need
I bought a second one of these as a gift.  It has all the features I like.
"I ordered my watch band and was very pleased! Although, I did not read the reviews ahead of time and the screw for my adapter fell out. I was unable to find it. I work at the Apple Store in Raleigh and when your $500 watch falls on the floor in the middle of the store with 300 people it's hard to find a screw that small... It would be helpful if I could find the size for the screw so I could replace it. If anyone knows, it would be a great help."
Arrived fast. I gave it four stars because it don't always turn the phone off when shutting case you still need to shut it off manually.
Bought it as a gift and my parents love it.
Just like apples
Wife loved it a stylish but suttle replacement for the OEM option.  Ordered second one for other family member.<br /><br />Same sizes and quality as original band.
"This  was a great fit, but the cover started peeling off."
"Case fit and worked but did not notice a change in the battery life, also every time I dropped my phone the case fell apart and all of my batteries came out"
Love it! Well made and I have the matching ipad case in pink!<br />Many compliments. I highly recommend it!
He loves it!
My phone has a new life!
"I love this case, it's very durable and spunky! Seller was amazing also!!"
Works great
Product arrived on time and I'm very happy with the quality of the case fits securely on my One+1
excellent
I have no complaints.
"The second I used this screen protector, it cracks, very low quality and waste of money, try use the money to buy a better one. Luckily this time the phone did not damaged, but it is really the worst one I had ever use."
"A good to have peripheral for emergency charging. Love the cable which came with it although a bit short. One con is that it is not very portable to carry on road (you cannot carry it in the pocket). However, at this price I'd take that any day."
works great
"Unfortunately, the battery wouldn't charge - it was DOA.  The shelf life must have expired.  Would like a replacement.  Thank you."
Love that this came fully charged!! Perfect size to throw in your purse for those days that you need it in an emergency. Fast delivery- nicely made charger!
Niece loves it
Had it 2 months and it completely separated at the plug.
"This is a really great phone case. It really does protect it from accidental drops..which is something I definitely need!<br /><br />The design is also very nice. I love the vibrant pink color, and the slim design is very attractive.<br /><br />Note: I got this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
Dont fit tight enough and wont charge unless sitting idle on a flat surface - pointless to have a 10' cord if you cant move or use your phone - TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY- already in the trash!
Excellent product
doesnt do a great job. my screen cracked.
Broke on the first day i got it.. i needed it for a concert and i couldn't use it. Wanted to love it tho color was awesome
Did not fit phone. Waste of money.
So far i love this product!!! Love just setting it down and having it charge!
very fast phone
"Product arrived on time, but failed to mention it only works for specific phone systems. Also the microphone had no capable function of working as it was defective"
It didn't work after the first use. The battery power bank just heated up to the point that I thought it would burn my hand when I touched it.  For $5 I figured it was worth a try.
"Great alternative to those who have an older model vehicle, works great when you find the right station. Thanks"
my mistake for choosing this product. I did not realize that it is intended for pilots and yacht owners. I hike and bike and this device is not optimized for this. It did  not last even a week.
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this. I tried a different, $12, vent gripper model that claimed it was big enough for Nexus 6, but it broke in the first 7 minutes of use with my nexus in its case (not a very thick case, but that may have been the critical factor). I was worried this one wouldn't stick to my curved dash (haven't tried it on a textured area yet) but it holds TIGHT! Took it on a road trip and it did a great job. I live in a high heat area (100 F is normal right now) and it has had NO slippage/falling off of the dash. Great product for a great price. Def a go-to item for any Nexus 6 owners."
Great for Run
Great.
Durable case on construction site!
"***Ok, it's now a couple of months after the installation and I'm upgrading this little unit to 5 stars. It's dialed in, set to my preferences, and now all I have to do is the occasional tweak to the remote knob on the dash depending on the track / genre that's playing through the head unit. There's a respectable amount of bass, it's clean, it's got a good punch and I'm not abusing it at all, just using it to fill in the bottom end. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat if I needed a sub for another vehicle, and I've recommended it to several friends / family that are upgrading their systems as well. Still haven't covered up the blue LED, but it's situated on the dash so when I'm driving, the steering wheel blocks that LED from my eyes... I'm ok with that.**  Had it professionally installed in a '94 Chevy C1500 regular cab under the passenger seat, out of sight. It's paired up to a Pioneer head unit using RCA plugs, and filling in the bottom end for the Pioneer 2 way 4x6 dash speakers and factory 4x6 pillar speakers (pillar speakers soon to be replaced).  First, I bought this on the strength of the reviews I read here on Amazon. I'm happy to say, this sub seems to live up to those reviews. It's only been in the truck for 2 days now, so I'm still dialing it in, but it rocks. Even the installer (who had never seen the LOPRO8 before) was surprised in a very good way as to how nice it sounds and has said he'll be recommending it to his customers looking for something to fit in a small space. No, it won't rattle neighbor's windows 3 doors down the street, and no, it won't vibrate the mirrors on the car next to me at the stoplight, but I'm 53 years old and WAY past that stage. It fills my truck cab VERY nicely without overpowering the rest of the music, which is all I need or want. I spend an hour each way in my truck back and forth to work, and this will make the trip quite enjoyable. I predominately listen to rock, blues, classical and jazz, and so far from Rimsky-Korsakovto Metallica to Al DiMeola to BB King, this sub seems to perform extremely well and I am VERY happy with it.  My only issue is the brightness of the blue LED for the remote knob. Yeah, that'll be covered with something very soon - it's WAY too bright and very distracting."
This is very much worth the money. This case seems like it should be about $50. One heck of a deal. Mind only took about 3 and a half days to come and came with no problems. The design is good and feels great. The screen protector is not so good but are very cheap to buy the good kinds. I highly recommend this case to everyone.
good
GOOD BUY
Great value. No problems
Great product
"It took weeks for the Chargers to arrive. Then, none of them work! Cheap for a reason."
Didn't work. Got not compatible message and it didn't charge. Had to get one from service provider!
It's fine
Works perfect
Works better then I thought! The voice offers so many tip durning the directs
Not working
Super cute! A little big so it slides around a bit but not annoyingly so. Still love it!
"LOVE THIS!!!! If you hate charging your phone and always being attached to a wall, this is perfect. The quality of the batteries is the same quality as the battery that originally came with my phone. I'm on my phone a lot so that used to mean I had to charge my phone a lot as well, but now when my battery is low, I just switch it out and recharge the other battery. I've had the batteries and charger for 6 months now and I'm still impressed. I definitely recommend this product!"
Great Case for my phone :)
Perfect! It's exactly what I needed. Product looks great and built well. I highly recommend!
"Great case.  The only thing I wish it had had was something silicone to get a better grip of the surface, and a slightly raised front face so when you lay the phone down the screen down't touch the surface of whatever it is on.  Other than that, great case.  Very cute."
I love it.....just what I wanted!
The grip units on the back and side make it easy to hang onto.  Fits phone perfectly without adding to much to the overall size.
Really sturdy case!
awesome rugged case--great buy
"great, you can hear crystal clear."
A lot more durable than the original apple lightning cable. Amazon's warranty is also great. My cable messed up within a year and they sent me a full refund to purchase another one.
"fast delivery, totally satisfied"
"Within less than 3 weeks the print was fading and the card holder slots were ripping apart. It held the phone nice but as for the case itself, its a certified POS. I'm already having to order a new case. Definitely not going with this on again"
BUENO
not easy to install. if you get one spec of dust on the side that sticks to the tablet it is impossible to get it cleaned.  You would need a 'clean room' to install these.
Very cheap and falls apart easily
The heat inside the car made the item fall apart. The magnet wont stick to the car either. The audio always has a hissing sound when connected to a device. This was a complete waste of money!
"I use up battery on my phone like no other. I love having a couple of backups. Batteries work fine and charger works great too. No issues. I have charged the Anker batteries in my Samsung charger, and charged the samsung battery in the Anker charger. It is awesome to have a spare battery and backup charger all the time. Super pleased with this product."
So far so good.  Had it mounted to my dashboard & it worked great. Did not leave any marks when removed.  Currently have it attached to a weighted sandbag mount that allows me to move it from car to car.  Holds great.  Doesn't lose it's grip on hot days in the sun like the typical suction cup mount.
It is a good product
"Works great and it will keep my S3 useful for another year or 2, saves me from buying another phone. And for the price, can't beat it"
Great
Love having protection for my cell phone screen.  Easy to install and clean
"I tried my Galaxy S4 in partial sun (cloudy) today. Started at 91%. Went out to check it 20 minutes later and was at 100%. I was happy about that. The reason I only gave it 4 stars, is Amazon and the companies advertising on Amazon shows 2.4 amps output for each USB port, but the manual that came with it reads 2.1 amps output for each port. I specifically purchased this unit for the higher capacity current capability.<br />Can XDragon chime in on this?<br /><br />I will be glad to receive my USB Detector to test it in full sun."
Exactly as advertised
Great product at an unbeatable price! Would buy again.
This is amazing for the price.so many features takes a while to get use to excellent subwoofer control and seperate output for mids amp.equalizer is great and bluetooth
This is NO way shape or form fits the Galaxy S6 phone!!  Waste of time and money
"Good quality item. Reliable, great sound for the price"
Love the wireless transmission after years of wired setups.
"Perfect screen protector! Same, if not better quality than the ones you pay $50 for in cell phone stores."
Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
Didn't realize it has an internal fan.  Pretty noisy.  Embarrassing to use in conference room with others.
Fit my Samsung Galaxy S4 perfectly. Comfortable and soft.
"Works well, very happy."
"I purchased this as a gift for my mom. She's used it every day for a few months and loves it. There is enough space for cash, a drivers licence and maybe 2 more cards. She doesn't normally pay with credit or debit cards so that works fine for her. If you have lots of cards this might not be for you. It fits the phone well and she doesn't find it hard to use with the case on. The included stylus is ok, she doesn't use it. I think this case is a great value! Locally these same cases are sold for twice or three times what you pay here on Amazon. So don't think that you always get what you pay for because at your mall you might be paying more for the same stuff."
"I ordered a 2 pack, but they sent me a 4 pack. No complaints here! My wife's phone is buggy and doesn't work with the cheaper cables, but these cables work great! I won't buy from any other source. These cables are a great price and feel sturdy."
Stopped working after a couple of weeks
I bought this because I've recently started working on a building site and didn't want my phone getting clogged up with dust and dirt. But I also work in a bar and decided to test the ruggedness of the waterproofness(?). So I decided to put some paper in it and put the case through the dishwasher there and the case came out unscathed and the paper as dry as it should be. I am perfectly happy with this case
The glass bubbled between both of the iphones and screen. We were not able to seal it or reset the glass.
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
"I just received this product, however the screw that came with didnt fit inside. It is really disappointing."
Very durable case
"I am a regular shopper of Amazon, and never leave reviews.  But this is worth a review since it has none prior to mine.  I ordered two other cases before this one, and they weren't to the level of this one.  The phone case fits very nice around the phone and has a soft leather feel to the back.  It has strong magnets that keeps it in place in the wallet, but still makes it easy to remove when you want to use just the phone for pics etc. without having the bulk of the wallet.  This was what I was looking for in a case the most...a wallet that still allowed for the phone to be easily removed if needed.  The card holder having 9 slots and snaping together so that your personal info isn't viewable when you are using or checking your phone is wonderful and surprisingly hard to find in other cases.  Having the card slot designed this way also prevents the cards from scratching your screen.  The only thing I would change about the case would be to make the strap that holds the entire case together a snap instead of a magnet.  I haven't had any issues with the magnet, but it would feel more secure if it was a snap.  I would recommend this case to anyone that has the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus."
"Good casing i like it. good quality and it fits my iphone 6. the casing is good quality and I am glad i got this product. I really like it. I really recommend the product and it is money worth it. Good condition, good packaging. I Got this with a good price discount during promotional product in exchange of unbiased and honest reiews."
Great
works just fine in AT&T hot spot and a lot cheaper than most others want for the same thing with a different number. I'm not sure it will take or hold as large of a charge but it makes a wonderful backup when your on the road and you forgot or just didn't bring your charger.
Worked once. Was hoping I could rate it with no stars.
Good stock replacement - They are okay.
"Great Quality Product. Case fits like a glove. Not bulky like those Fisher Price looking Otter Box Cases! If you don't work in construction or jump out planes,then this case is for you.  It's very  similar to my Spigen Neo Hybrid Case for my Samsung Note 3! Note: Spigen Cases are nice cases as well. VERUS design Lab you have just won yourself a loyal customer. Really like the attention to detail, great craftsmanship, superb work! Nice snug fit, doesn't make my phone feel bulky at all. Thank you VERUS design Labs!  👍👍 😉👊"
"Beatifull, I love it!"
Solar panels don't actually charge the battery. Set it out in the sun all day and no charge is accrued. Only charges if you plug it in.
"Amazing customer service, I have the one for My iPhone 5s and now that i'm getting a 6s plus I couldn't not buy this! Looking forward to putting it on when i get it!"
My friend's phone is as good as new.  This repair isn't for the timid but if you're not afraid of small parts and you're careful about keeping track of what screw goes where this is an easy way to make someone very happy.<br /><br />I just wish it were cheaper.  The part for a comparable-age iPhone is less than half as much.
Disappointed. Making due but doesn't really fit my vent. My phone flops down.
At first I was skeptical but this product was Perfect! My phone never got wet.
I bought it and took on vacation to Europe and this Power Bank performed great. We not only able to charge two devices at the same time but charge at much higher speed than standard charger.  It was a pleasant bonus I was not aware about it. It was also very convenient to charge it “on the road” when you are driving. Overall greatly deserved 5 stars
The add said of high quality and said it would incudle all mounting parts. I'm high dissatisfied
"Pretty cool, simple solution to minimizing your wallet. Do be careful about your phone size, though, because I had a Lifeproof case on my Galaxy S4 with this band on it and I had to be cautious taking it out of my pocket as sometimes the band would slip off the corners and dump my essentials on the floor."
This screen protector had a horrible &#34;halo&#34; all around the screen. I would not recommend.
"Very good, work as well as the more expensive bluetooth headset. I am very pleased"
I have a thin case on my phone and this is a hit and miss when trying to charge it.
"I like it, only issue is that the borders are somewhat annoying when swiping pages, but I guess there is nothing that can be done as the edge of the iphone 6 is curved and the screen protector surface is flat and can not reach the curved part..."
Diodes were in good conditions and functioned.
Worked perfectly!
The product description  intimated that the closure was secured by velcro.  I bought this product because I didn't want a magnet to close and secure the ipod case.  As it turns out the case is secured by a magnet.  Bummer
I love this case. Easy to hold. Buttons easy access and the gold matches perfectly. I'd buy it again.
Very poor quality. It does not work. I threw away packaging. So I am not sure how to return it
does the job I expected
"Looks nice, not too bulky"
It worked great on a trip out of the country - allowed recharges during the day while on buses or at lunch.
My husband loves these.  Just wish the charge lasted longer.
"Works well, has guide lines."
It works.
I bought my Jawbone Up Move at Costco. I went back to buy another for a friend And 2 for my daughters! So obviously I want more to share this awesome little device with peoe I love.  Love that I don't need to charge it. My fit bit was a pain in the butt to charge and wasn't accurate when the battery was low. I also love the app for reminders and advice. Don't LOVE the food tracker but I am truly using this for the activity monitor. Keeps you aware of just how active we really are - and you can also move more if you see you are low for a days goal.
I purchased this for semi shallow scuba dives less than 20' deep it does in fact keep the phone dry however you can't operate the phone while at depth I shure if it's the case or the phone
"In my 2003 BMW Z4, this product didn't work as expected. It plugged in and fit just fine to the back of the factory radio, but no AUX functionality. After cutting it apart, I noticed that it is missing the 1x 300kOhm resistor and 2x 0.022uF capacitors. If you wire the capacitors in series with the L and R wires, and the resistor in parallel in between, then your factory radio will work to recognize the AUX input.<br /><br />Overall, 2 stars because it didn't work out of the box and required a lot of modification to work properly. Price was cheap though."
I am Ble to always have a few business cards on hand!!
Just exactly what I needed.  So glad I could find this cell phone holder.
ok
My girlfriend loves her case
"I gave the unit five stars because it did what it claimed to do with one charge on this battery  I charged a cell phone with a 3200 mAh battery and a speaker and I did not deplete the battery, battery pack after the two charges had 62% charge remaining. The only comment I want to make is that the unit has an LED light but there are no instuctions on how to turn the light on, I found if you deprtess the power button twice the light turns on and off. I was sold the unit at a reduced cost for my feed back and if the unit did not live up to its expectation I would not have given it aa good review, however an un it with a battery of this size sells for three times as much in a cell phone store or other electronics retailer."
Loveeeeeeee it
I replaced the boston acoustic in my camaro with these and it has been a different world.  Def way better.
Car charger and wall charger work well.  The usb one is not the same size as the others and does not fit the phone.
Good glass amazing deal I love it
All is good with new case and price was excellent.
excellent product only bad thing is the camera resolution
"I got mine really fast. Its not what i expected it to be, it does not covers the top and the bottom fully, i mean it does not covers the headset jack or the microphone neither the USB connector, it is only covers the left and right side of the phone, and on the right side it covers around the power and volume buttons."
Definitely worth the money!  I haven't really pushed it to the limit but it charged my phone pretty quickly!
Favorite case I have used .Wish they made one for my new phone .
The screen did not stick to the entire phone causing unremovable air bubbles in the top corners and because the top did not stick all the way it got caught on my pocket and bent the entire top down.
"The headline says it all. Don't buy this watch if you are expecting to use the GPS, as it does not work. Search the internet and you will see that this is a known issue and that Sony will do nothing to resolve it (Refund? ha! Warranty repair? Ha!).  What a waste of $200."
"Perfect for charging 2 kindles, my Bose rechargeable headphones and my MP3 player simultaneously"
"What can I say, I wanted to connect my old monitor, and this item works for that purpose. Seems well made."
"Poor, feel apart after first use"
It's my favorite case right now it's slim it's nice and it keeps my iPhone protected at all time.
"Cute case. Can hold ID and a couple cards, but not cash and cards and ID because then it won't close. But overall, exactly what I wanted. Perfect for nights out on the town. Love the wristlet attached to keep hold of it!"
It does not attach correctly.. It looked nice but the case was loose and the plug wouldn't connect to the phone.
Excellent all-around product with great pricing and shipping time frame actions.
Made out of strong material.  Great protection for your phone.
Doesn't fit properly
2 of the 4 corners did not stick. This is a 2 pack and same thing happen with both. I still wore my watch with the screen protector on and dust got under the 2 corners and caused them to lift more and it just didn't last.
Everything was as promised.  Thanks!
fits like a glove
This is what I need. It looks small but fit the charger. White color very pretty. Thanks.
Excellent product.
"Works great with my iPad Mini. Would give it a 5 star except the dang thing doesn't stay put on the top on the mini. Not a major problem, a piece of Double stick foam tape and a rubber band solved the problem. I like it and I use it and would buy again for this price.<br />For the design engineers reading this ... if you had put a small &#34;dummy&#34; tab that fit into the contact slot on the top next to where this plugs in ... it would be perfect and not move about."
"It worked perfectly. Have had no issues with it, continues to charge with out fail."
Great product
Very pleased with the product. Good quality. Ordered and received in a timely manner.
Sound is good but doesnt go nearly as far as they claim.
Works as stated.
i love it
Works great for my android phone (galaxy s5). Full mirror screen projection to my big screen tv.
Love this speaker. Bought it to go paddle boarding and it works great. Can't believe the great sound coming from this little speaker. Very happy with my purchase. Just wish it came in more colors:-)
"This is stylish and this is sleek.  Importantly, it's truly heavy duty.  Yes, it's bulky, and that's fine with me.  Otterbox has rightly become a leader in protective cases.  If you value your Samsung Galaxy S6, Getting this rightly called &#34;defender&#34; is a step in the right direction.  Very highly recommended."
Saved a lot of money! Almost purchased a new one at a store for $40.00! Free shipping! Can't beat that!
"This car mount is great to use. It is a little heavier and bulkier than I like, but over all great quality and works wonderful. I would recommend this product to anyone. It is a nice feeling as well and doesn't scratch your stuff."
"Works exactly as the original...contacted SanDisk first, and they gave me the run a round trying to get a replacement...buying this was much easier than dealing with SanDisk."
"I like this because it does not show fingerprints easily.  I bought a different one before this, but didn't like it at all.  This one is high quality."
Works so good just ordered one for my desk . One thing tho you do need a 2 amp charger. it comes with a usb wire but no charger.
Works like advertised.  Convenient with the cup holder thing.  It was a liitle small for the cup holders in a Chevy van but one of those foam can insulators made it fit like a charm.
Decent headset for the price
it broke within a week of purchasing.  Total garbage!
Great product.
Great item my customers love the results from repairs using your product thanks
"Update 05/06/17: Piece of junk. Skips recording. Almost every time I need video of an incident it is missing. It will have video before or video after, but not what I need. DO NOT waste your money on this camera.<br />Update 10/27/15: Have started having problems with KDLINKS X1. The camera reboots continuously for about three minutes every time I cut my vehicle off. I have been in touch with the seller and was told it is probably a battery issue. They asked me to charge the unit with a phone charger for several hours, which I am currently doing, and see if that fixes the problem.<br /><br />After doing my research on dash cams I purchased the KDLinks X1 Full- HD camera along with a (Panorama S 2015 edition updated Sony Exmor IMX322 Sensor CMOS DashCam PowerUCC Panorama 2S / S International Model) and installed both in my truck side by side. Both cameras had the best reviews for the cost on several forums. Both cameras have performed well. Even though both manufactures recommend taking the camera out of the vehicle on hot days, I have not. I have left both on my windshield all summer in a black truck with the windows up and plenty of 100 degree plus days without a problem. The picture quality on both cameras is excellent both day and night. The KDLinks ships with a GPS module and software that will display your speed and location on google maps when played back and it was $20 cheaper than the Panorama. The KDLinks cord was also much longer. The Panorama S can handle larger storage cards. The reason for four stars instead of five is the mount. The suction cup is built well and holds good but the swivel/disconnect that goes between the camera and suction cup is very weak. So flimsy that they include an extra one with the adhesive mount. If they fix this they will have a perfect setup. The mount on the Panorama is rock solid but it cost $20 more and does not come standard with GPS."
"Looks great with a Apple watch, IPhone 6 plus, and a full sized iPad 4 with smart cover on.  Holds everything great, looks clean and organized, and the magnetic watch charger does a good job at holding the watch securely in place.  The wood has a really good look to it.  I'm impressed"
An ultimate band
Great product works fine
"I am very disappointed in this product.  Prior to installing this on my wife's Note 4, I installed one of their tempered glass protectors on my LG G4 and was quite pleased.  The one for my G4 covered my phone screen completely, with just a very small hazy bubble on the bottom section that is barely noticeable.  With this in mind, I thought that the one for my wife's Note 4 would have a similar fit and finish.  As you can see from the pictures, this was not the case at all.  First, it only covers the active screen portion, and leaves a 1-2 mm gap all the way around.  In addition to this, there is an air gap about the same 1-2 mm from the edge of the screen protector from where the glass just doesn't sit down all the way.  I'll be looking for other glass screen protectors in the future."
"So far I've been very happy with this adapter.  I have used all of the different USB variants that this cable provides and have been very happy with it.  I've not tested the charge speed since typically I am just leaving the units overnight so I can't speak to that.  I assume that when you are charging multiple devices at the same time, the charge rate will decrease.<br /><br />About the only think I can complain about is the length of the adapter.  It is extremely short and so I had to buy a little 6&#34; or 1' extension just to get it from the plug to our counter top.  Would buy again!"
I have had this phone a little over a year and it will not hold a charge.  Junk!
"The cover is chique, but lacks the dimple.  It fits like a glove and gives a very good grip.<br />The screenprotector is difficult to use combined with the case...the screenprotector should be a little bit smaller.  The edge of the cover 'picks' on the screenprotector making it come loose in at least one corner.<br />Never the less 5 stars because I bought a nice case and got the protector for free."
It was what I expected and as described by the seller
Just what I was looking for
Didn't even work :/
good product at a great price
"I went to the Bahamas for vacation and participated in Pat & Tina's Snorkel Adventure in Freeport, Bahamas. I read about the FRIEQ Waterproof case prior to ordering based on customer reviews. I was ecstatic about this item since I'm a photographer in my own right take many pictures and selfies within a days time. I. really wanted to capture the essence of photos on and under water without damage to my smartphone. Well I must say I highly recommend this product it is all that and then some. Very easy storage and use of the smart phone while in the case. I snorkeled with the case around my neck connected to the lanyard and all I had to do was click away. My photos on my Samsung Galaxy were clear as a bell. The video recording was authentic underwater when recording. The only thing I had a problem with while underwater...when I pressed the button to record, it didn't recognize the command underwater, so I just pushed the button above water and recording was in process while I proceeded to go under."
"This is a really simple case and was exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />I swapped out my Work BlackBerry for an iPhone 5c and I swear the iPhone is made of Teflon. I needed something to counter the extreme slickness and this Caseology case does the trick while not greatly increasing they size of the phone.<br /><br />If the iPhone esthetics are critically important to you, you can still see the original phone through the clear backing. It manages to be &#34;gripable&#34; without pulling everything in your pocket out with it like some cases I have seen. The corner bumpers look like they will provide enough protection for modest drops and all of the switches are still easily usable.<br /><br />A great value."
This is the best android phone shield I had bought. It is made well. Installation is simple and easy. Make sure to follow the instruction. With a little skill I was able to install it perfectly.
"GARBAGE, Absolute garbage!  Charging a premium price for a piece of junk like this is shameful. Tip completely separated from cable after second use.  I have no reason to believe this is a counterfeit, it's Belkin making a junk product.  A counterfeit might actually work better."
"This kit does not come with the saddle clamps so if your speakers do not have the clamps to connect the speaker to the mount, then you will need to contact customer service at bazooka to get the clamps.  Otherwise, this is a high-quality product at a great price."
"I bought this for a Nexus 6. I love the black bezels on this tempered glass screen protector, it makes the phone look as if there isn't a screen protector on. Installation was easy, but you have to be careful not to cover the front camera lens."
So far so good. Just wish it had included a newer iPhone connector.
Clip broke within 2-3 weeks of having it
Great case.
This cover saved my phone for over two years. I dropped it many times without a scratch.
"I bought two of these since the price was right.  I figured that at least one of them would die fairly quickly, and that would leave me with one good one to depend on.  They have both been flawless to date, and I have had no trouble with them whatsoever,  The size and shape make them easy to pack and store while your not using them, but still gives a good feel in the hand while you are plugging things in.  The only possible drawback is that with it's enormous storage capacity, it takes a while to fully charge, but I can only curse physics for that."
Soft case no protection here and a sloppy fit around the edges And whatever you do  DONT GET THE WHITE.After an hour in my soft case I wear on my belt it came out stained with black scuff marks.and they don't come clean up.
I really love this case. It gives great protection. I think the screen protector that came with it is a bit on the cheap side but that didn't matter to me at all. I love the quality of the phone case. It was a bit hard for me to get it off when I wanted to change my cases though.
Granddaughter loves her case
excellent product!
"This is the best power adapter I ever used for my iPhone. I bought one 8month ago and never had any problems. This time I bought another one for my work place. This change the iPhone so first! This is real, great product!"
a
Works great. Very little sound distortion with higher volumes. Would recommend.
Nice set
This works great. No one can  look over your shoulder and see what you're doing!
"Everything & more, better than otterbox which I had prior."
"It's big, bulky, and overpriced. A half dozen little country-specific adapters would cost less and take up less space in your luggage; but my daughter liked the simplicity of this item and continues to use it to charge her phone even when not traveling. At least it's lightweight.<br /><br />And yes, even if you put black tape over the light, it still glows."
"Not bad, but it is not the best. However, considering the price, it could be a good bargain."
I love this case it's very cute
"Good quality blutooth headset ,It can pair with my Iphone very well and fast ."
Very cute and I've used it for a long time. It protects the screen and is easy to open and close and I like that I can throw an ID & debit card in it when I don't want to carry my purse.
Used for iPod.  Works fine.  Makes taking a selfie easy.  Not complicated to figure out.
it is great
excellent product!
great
"Seller Contacted me twice and offered to assist me in any way. The cover would not stayed closed and looked very inexpensive on the expensive watch! I gave them 4 stars as they were willing to assist me in any way, but the product I would not buy again."
"secure fit, very well made"
"I bought this from the DeYoung website because it is the only place I could find it for the Galaxy S5.  The case is hard,  it does have a little bit of a lip to help protect the screen. It is extremely beautiful,  the colors are vibrant, and I get compliments on it all the time!"
"Excellent battery pack, huge life. built very well and feel solid. I picked it up as a lightning deal for $14 and have used it for almost a year now."
"Best phone case, rugged and hard wearing, fits my iPhone 6 Plus perfect, port covers in the right place, worth the cost."
Works great!!
"This thing is awesome. Easy to apply and extremely solid, yet somehow not too thick..."
Great swimming gear.
My order was missing the stylus.
"Great product, has just about everything you need to get the job done!"
"This case is pretty cool I must say. I took it out of the packaging and it feels sturdy and extremely durable. I love the pink on pink color combo with the white accent. I have a white iPhone 6 plus so it looks just like the picture. I would not recommend it if you had a black iphone 6 plus. it'll look funny. The other thing is for some reason my iPhone fingerprint does not work with the case because the case edges are kind of lifted to protect the corners a bit more than other cases. Not sure if it is a good thing or bad thing. I also have long nails so maybe those 2 clash. I just took off my passcode and fingerprint so I can get into my phone if I need to. Other than that, super cute, and great price! I received this at discount in exchange for my honest review."
I'm very please my new phone case
It looked solid when I assembled it but head mount started to drop. You have to constantly tight it .
The cable is too short😞
This phone only lasted 1 mo. Then couln't get a refund or credit. Very disappointing!
PERFECT!!  Fits iphone 6 plus and more. Streamline design and super cute!
easy to use. clear for me and the other person.
goob seller A+
It last for five hrs. Come with a wire to CHARGE  your earphones. For those who are new to bluetooth earphones.
It messed up my photos they came out looking like a big white ball
"Wonderful to use within U. S., esp. for overseas travellers.<br />The setup to use data is somewhat difficult, but after it is setup properly, you have data access within U. So."
Fun little case. Sling on your shoulder and go.
"Have not used it much yet, but appears to be a very handy power supply."
Received Jam Box<br />Coupled with Bluetooth without issue<br />Sound is awesome!!
It only lasted 2 months and now it doesn't work at all. It doesn't charge or anything. :(
Love it
excelente
Cheap price great quality!
Love these cords - quick charge - long and convenient - I have ordered more since the first order.
Just right.  Arrived quickly.  Definitely very durable; I had the same brand case for an iPhone 4.  And you can't beat the price!
"Second time buying this item! Dropped my phone at work and happened to catch the ONE screw in my whole computer office that I did not pick up, thus cracking the protective screen. I reordered this on amazon and got a new one in the mail next day.When putting on the new screen there was a little bubble defect in the one corner. After calling Luvvitt they promptly, no questions asked, sent me a new screen two days after request was put in. The new screen went on just fine and my phone is once again protected. I would recommend this product to ANYONE looking for a screen cover. My co-woker has a $40 screen protector and honestly I could not tell the difference between mine and hers (I am VERY picky and detailed). She tried to explain &#34;well hers comes with lifetime replacement warranty and all she has to do is pay $15 for replacement now.... I paid $12 and free replacement when the screen had a bubble.... Beat that!"
Love it
"Love this thing. It stays put! If in doubt, get this one. You won't be sorry."
Was as described and works great!! Boyfriend loved it!
"We have several avid bikers in the family and all of them have used the clamp-and-cradle type phone holders that  mount on the handlebar and keep your phone where you can see it at all times.  They're handy, but what do you do if it rains?<br /><br />We live in an area with high annual rainfall.  Particularly in some seasons and particularly if you're riding in the mountains, a day-long ride is very likely to include some rain.  You can take your phone out of the phone holder and put it in your backpack or waist pack, but that kind of defeats the purpose, doesn't it?<br /><br />This innovative holder has a universal adjustable clamp that attaches easily to any bike.  Once it's in place. you can rotate the holder so that your phone is horozontal or vertical.  You can also push the red button and detach the holder from the mount.  Handy if you want to take your phone inside without removing it from the waterproof envelope and exposing it to moisture.<br /><br />The holder itself is a heavy-duty waterproof nylon.  The back is heavily reinforced and the velcro that keeps it closed  does the job.  The thick plastic &#34;window&#34; allows you access to your phone while protecting it from rain.  It's roomy enough to handle even the new larger phones and phones that are in a case.<br /><br />***** I was given a free sample of this product.  The seller offered nothing but the sample and asked for nothing but an honest opinion.*****  Everyone who's seen this (and some of them are experienced bikers) has been impressed.  All of them commented that the price is right and that it looks like it will stand up to a LOT of hard use - which is what a bike-mount phone holder gets.  The seller must agree, since they offer a full year's warranty. The design is good and both the materials and the workmanship are excellent.  If you ride in the rain, you should consider it."
Sound quality is very poor compared to the 730. If you like listening to load music that sound great. Then get the 730. If you just like using them for talking then buy the 750.
Broke after 2 weeks.
Don't have a friend kick the cord sending it sideways from the plugged in phone and it works great. The end snapped off in my iphone charging dock at about the time my friend was learning if the consequences.
"Awesome case! Hardly notice it compared to my old one. I love my rugged i-Blason case as well, but this is a nice touch when I don't want the bulk."
great
"The summary on the product said these are supposed to be noise cancelling headphones, they are not. They arent that comfortable either they fit like childrens library computer headphones. They dont get very loud. They arent noise cancelling at all. :("
Works just fine.
Broke within a week. Don't recommend
"Awsome case while it lasted, to bad it was only 2 weeks."
"Multiple people, multiple products, everyone happy.  iFlash 4-port USB car charger is a life saver.<br /> No more fighting over who gets to charge their phones or ipads.  I have regular cords and two 6 foot cords so that people in the back can charge at the same time.  This is a must!!<br />I have not noticed any charging concerns. Everyones phones and ipads charged at regular rates.<br />https://www.amazon.com/review/RSK4FZJ5TIIEQ/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm"
"I tried this for the first time today.  First, it is impossible to access the screen in any useful way when using this.  That is because it goes on the side of your arm where most people can't see clearly.  Second, the plastic cover continuously hit different parts of the screen and kept launching apps and changing screens unintended.  It was a huge disappointment.  On my way out of the gym today I threw this thing in the trash.  It's useless.  Pockets work better."
"I like it so far, there are a few things I want to monitor regarding performance before I can say I'm actually having problems. It was a good price compared to retail and some Amazon ones. After all this time it still is working, but one of the ear buds cable stopped working properly."
"Looked great when I got it, but it was difficult to put on the phone. I cracked it once while trying to install it, then it cracked again on the side a few days later. I hadn't dropped it or anything, so I'm not sure why that happened... After about a week of using this case I'm not very happy. Getting a completely different case to replace this one ASAP. Bummer."
Very good
"works as expected with Ipad and iphone. I do like the braided cable, since I have broken 3 of my previous cable due to intensive cabling...."
Great phone for the price
It works really good!👍🏽
"Does it's job well....I have owned it for about 2 weeks now. Has been charging my smartphone well. Charges from about 50% to full in about 2.15 hrs, which is pretty good. I connect my cell phone on the 1 amp port. It was shipped from China, had to clean off the dust, but other than that, no complaints!"
Good
Great product liked it very much.  Would order again.
"I'm giving this product a 2 because it looks great and my son loved it, but it broke in 3-days.....😏 i guess a part on the side cracked & kept getting caught going in and out his pocket!  So not a good buy😔😢 toobad because we luv the Giants!!"
"Very discreet--the most visibly subtle Bluetooth headset I have seen--James Bond will be buying one of these. I can hear well, and the person I speak to also said they can hear me clearly. I just received it, so I will continue to test on more phone calls. I will update my review if anything changes."
Best price and good quality
Good quality phone case.
"My first bluetooth, and I love it. Why did I not do this a long time ago? Who knows."
this is a great case for the money. It has a good design and fits well on my phone. It prevents any dust/dirt accumulation and is relatively water resistance. It provides protection without addidng significant size.  I give it 5 Stars. Additionally the ability to change colors of the case is a nice addition
It works!  My phone fell onto the pavement as I was getting out of my car and it caused a dent and broken glass appearance. I freaked out a little until I peeled off this screen protector and there was absolutely no damage to the phone itself. All of the damage was absorbed by the screen protector! Happy!
"Your submitted review: Packaging was nice. Screen protector had blue stickers on both sides so it came super clean. Also, it comes with a wipe to clean out any extra dust that may have gotten in. The install was straight forward and simple. Clean phone, case, insert phone and snap in. Put rubber cover on and press into place.  Choose the color you want and press into back. Swapping is easy to. I received this case to review it from New Trent. Happy with it."
"Wish the connector plug was three inches longer, as it sits behind the TV and is impossible to hit the sync button unless I move the TV.  Other than that, am pleased."
I bought this for my s4 and an otterbox commuter case for my husband 1 year ago. We both accidentally dropped our phones on the ground a few times. Now he's looking for a new case while mine still works perfectly and only has some scratches on the back.
The Worst thing I've ever purchased. Did not fit my phone at all. Entirely too small and not properly aligned i have a Galexy 6edge and couldn't use the edge featured with the cover
Love my phone case. It's just what I wanted.
"This Liger XS400 is very manageable to use especially when you are driving and wants to talk using your phone hands-free. It is very lightweight and can be rotated depending on your comfort level. You can use it for either left or right ear and the earpiece doesn't hurt your ear. I have tried it using my iPhone 6, iPad table and Samsung Galaxy tab and all works perfectly fine as long as you can connect it to a bluetooth. I did not have any problem with the sound and speech volume. This only come in one piece so don't get frustrated if you only see one, the purpose is to make use of the device at a portable state. I got this at a promotional rate to give honest feedback on the product and it has served its purpose well."
as expected
World's great
so far so good!
Purchased for co-worker.  They were very pleased with case.
"If your looking for a cheap touch screen and don't care about Bluetooth then this is your unit!! Installation was a breeze all wires are colored as they should be, unit performs all tasks flawlessly very impressed for an 85 dollar unit!"
I was very dissappointed in this product it didn't work the directions couldn't really read it.
It is my first time to have a case from Spigen and I like the  sleek design of the case. It really protected my cellphone.
"This was a gift for my daughter due her frequent traveling.  Its a very significant piece of equipment but she is enjoying, plus she likes being able to help her friends by charging their devices as well.  This is long lasting even after most portable chargers are dead this one is still going."
Absolutely LOVE it
"Good quality, works well.  I would have given 5 stars except it does not work if you have a case on your iPhone.  Small inconvenience for the savings vs buying a genuine Apple product.  Tip is slightly larger than necessary thus you can't plug into phone portal with case on phone."
"I read the reviews before I purchased this case because I wanted to make sure that it'll protect my phone if I accidentally dropped it. I thought it looked really sturdy and well built based on the reviews, description and pictures but the whole case is made out of plastic. I was surprised by the material because I thought that the cover was going to be made out of rubber. The &#34;rubber&#34; part of the case feels like plastic. I got the silver case because it looked so nice on the pictures but mine already had some scratches and was a bit of a dull color. This case did not protect my phone from damages when it accidentally fell about 3 feet of the wooden floor and ended up breaking the screen. I paid for this product alongside a screen protector which I believe is from a different company and ended up wasting almost $40 and my time. I wish I just bought the otter box instead of being thrifty."
smaller than I'm expected
"The graphics could've been better, it was nice tho!! 😍"
Very nice as described
I love it!
"I like it very much. It has room for an Ionizer (smoker) to get rid of bad smells, a 1A USB charger port for my new Bluetooth Sunglasses for listening to music from my iPhone and answering/calling, a 2A USB charger port for charging my iPad. Did not get a full score as I was unable to find a cigarette lighter that fitted without removing the outer part of the lighter and I have to hold it in to make it work/get power. Reason for missing start: It seems the metal sleeve in the charger is a bit too tight, but I have had trouble with a couple of other double-plug chargers as well, but it might be me that is unable to find one that fits and no problem with the dimension of the charger. If so, please correct me and it will get a full score. The adjustable angle will make it fit in just about all cars: A nice feature."
So far so good!. I like the little multiple adapters it comes with!.
broke within the first couple of days
"Selfie I love taking pictures wherever I go and I’m glad that I got this selfie stick from Kengadget. There are a lot of selfie sticks out there but for me, by far this product stands out.  It looks more modern and sleek and also it is very well made. I have an Android phone and I did not have any problems pairing my Bluetooth with it. It’s lightweight and so convenient to use. You just have to turn it on, connect your phone with it, flash your perfect smile and click the button to take a picture. I love that it holds up your phone securely and also it has a wrist strap just to secure it in your wrist if you are clumsy like me.  You can extend it just enough to get a perfect group picture or even a nice view. Now I’m looking forward to our next vacation because this selfie stick will surely help in capturing every nice moment perfectly. Disclaimer: I received this as a complimentary product in exchange of my fair feedback."
This is the best case for the S5 in my opinion.
"This case works great. It stays in place while I am jogging and doing zumba. My iPhone 6 was able to fit in it no problem with my slim phone case on. Compared to my current armband case this one has a larger adjust-ability range. I was able to have it fit on my forearm as well as my bicep and it fit on my husband's bicep as well and his are much larger than mine. The strap and the back of the case isn't quite as cushy as my other one, but it is still fairly cushy. Overall this case is very good and very function-able.<br /><br />I did receive this item either at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.<br />All thoughts and opinions are my own."
"I love this player as a great accompaniment to my Nokia Lumia 1020. It charges perfectly, connects easy, and has great sound. Definite fan of this product for sure."
The best Bluetooth on the market
As expected
Better than I had hoped for.
This was perfect for my 4 month old to stay occupied during our road trip! It was a life saver!
Even the dealer was envious of this item.
got this for my daughter's birthday looks and feels awesome. will buy another one soon for my phone
"I've had used different devices from iPhones to Galaxy Notes, iPads and BlackBerrys but boy I'm glad I took a leap and went to BlackBerry! This is the best phone ever. It runs Android apps so you won't miss those productivity apps you have on your previous device(s).<br /><br />Somebody had a great review here so I won't even try to convince you. I will just say, get the device, use the device and then give your verdict. It's awesome!"
Exactly as described.  The camera hole sets this protector in a class by itself.
Really cute and fun design. Love it
"These don't fit properly, but did protect while on there."
"The first set of cables I got had problems but Anker support helped me out. The replacement cables work well and can accommodate a thick case, though mine is very thin. Used the cables daily at work for a year and never had a problem with the pins getting weak."
"This is a great product if you have multiple USB-powered devices. Feels very substantial. The bright blue LED makes it a bit distracting for a nightstand. My main disappointment was that it will not charge my Asus Transformer Prime tablet, but then again I have been unable to find anything other than the original charger that came with it that can."
"Fast and easy to install with no bubble,it was so clear. I would buy another one once needed."
"I have gone through plenty of cables during my tenure with iPhones. Most are flimsy and poorly built and do not last long. I purchased this cable after buying other Tech Armor products and seeing that they are quality built and designed to last and do what their designed to do, PROTECT! I have used this cable for about 2 days now and you can feel the quality in the cable braid and the ends. I feel this cable is going to be with me for some time but if it ever fails, Tech Armor has a lifetime warranty. I have already had to use the warranty with my glass protection which absorbed the blow from a remote control that was thrown towards me but landed right on my phone. It took the blow and saved my screen!! There warranty is truly hassle free! You can't go wrong with Tech Armor!!<br />(Update) 9/7/15 After using this now for over a week I wanted to add that my charging time on my iPhone 6plus has decreased dramatically. It takes about 20 mins to go from 15% to 97% using my iPad mini charging block. I attribute this to the high quality materials used."
very good
"I debated with myself on whether I should do a 3 star review or a 1 star review, settling on 2 stars.  This phone is essentially great. It arrived in great condition, everything works and with an octa core, great sound, a nice design similar to the Galaxy S5, this phone seems like a great deal at 1/5 the price of the S5. There's only one flaw,  but it's so horrid that or makes this purchase not worth it.  It's 16 GB (or maybe 8?) with my own 32 GB micro SD and only 1 GB can be used for applications on your phone.  This is not enough for the apps you need, much less all your favorite apps. A lot of apps require being on your internal memory and you can't change how much of your internal memory you use for apps, unless you wanted to root your phone with a CHANCE of it working.  I returned it promptly and just got a Galaxy S5. The phones are close to the same size,  but due to slight differences, an S5 case will not work well with this phone."
Handy....nice you can put a couple of cards along with your ID in it
meets my needs
I love these guys. They are great products at terrific prices.
My son loves it!
"Brand new, without any scratch or whatever. Sincerely, much more that what I expected. Thank you"
A very solid case. Offers comprehensive protection of the device. Match all the colors by exchangeable back.
The best phone case I've ever had!!!
I purchased this for my grandson's phone. He loves it. Very sturdy and protects the phone.
"I bought 10 of these 10 ft. cables because I like to charge two or three devices where I use them when they need it, sometimes in the bedroom. living room and office, and don't want to unplug the cord and drag it with me.  I had problems with the original order in that they quickly began to lose their &#34;staying connectedness&#34;.  What I mean is that the small port would lose the ability to stay in the device, it would fall out if I didn't loop the cord around my hand to release any tension on the plug or it would fall out.  Then I had to start putting something under the plug where it connected to keep it in the right place so the interior part would make the connection and charge.  Finally my tablet just wouldn't charge on these cords, my phone and Kindle would, but not the tablet.  So I called Anker and they said send them back for replacement.  Before I could find them and a box to ship them in Anker had sent me one cable, thinking that's all I was having a problem with.  I re-called them and explained that no, it was all of them and I was still looking for all of them, that I'd only found 7 so far (some had been relegated to a dead electronics coffin somewhere).  Anker said they'd go ahead and replace the other 6 then, and I would ship back the 7.  I had shipped the 7 back by this time, my 7 had crossed their 1 in the mail, and that I was not happy that not only had I had the problem with all the cables, but that they had gotten the replacement shipping wrong also (I had followed both calls up with an email explaining the problem and that it happened with 10, and the order number to show I had originally ordered 10.  I asked for overnight shipping because I was having to make due with one Anker cable and one cheapie Walmart one that I had from the old days and it was very inconvenient.  They not only shipped out the originally asked for 9 additional (adding up to the 10 in the order) but did it Fed Ex Express (it was Friday when I called, nearly at the endof the day, so that was as close as they could get to overnight).  I've waited a couple of weeks to write this review to make sure the new cables stay secure and they do.  I also wanted to point out that Anker provides excellent customer service and, in my opinion, goes above and beyond what any company I've dealt with in the last 20 years will do.  They provide what customer service used to be &#34;in the old days&#34; when companies really wanted the customer to be happy and would go to whatever lengths it took to make that happen.  I would totally recommend them for any of their products, feeling comfortable that the company has the customers best interests at heart and will resolve any issues."
Great product.
"Display is as good as the original. I own more than one of these model phones so can make a side-by side comparison. The display is just as clear, bright and colorful as the original. Touch response is identical.<br /><br />Just find and follow a You Tube guide, take your time and don't forget to remove and reuse the speaker from the old screen. I heated my speaker a little with a hair dryer and pushed it from the front and it came out with no problems.<br /><br />The tool kit is pretty cheap, but good enough to perform the replacement operation the one time you will need it. If you plan to do this type of work for a hobby or a living, you should just buy a better grade of tools.<br /><br />Start to finish, 30 minutes."
Its excellent and looks like the original gold color of the phone. The touch screen works cery good
"Wasn't satisfactory at all. It quickt o freeze, no front camera & at certain point it will nust go blend"
"Buttons don't work properly, at all. Don't buy it. The only thing it is truly useful at is being car charger."
Fosmon MATT Series Rubberized Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 met my expectations.
Good quality at a fair price.
I ordered the galaxy design and received a rustic American flag design.
"Nice case, love the color."
"I received a promo code to give a fair review of this product. The case is fairly strong, and it does protect my phone without adding bulkiness. Overall I am pleased with this protection case. I would recommend this item."
Has worked flawlessly for over year then i ended up droping it and breaking it again. for the price you cant beat it though! would of bought another but it was time to upgrade from the 3gs
It is functional and protect my kid's iPhone well very. I like the wallet feature. The case is not as tight-fitting as I like.
This little gadget really reminds me to not forget my cell phone before leaving the house.  Great for me.
"DEVICE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE STYLUS, CLEARLY NOT AUTHENTIC BECAUSE OF THIS"
it didn't seem to work so we are not using it. ;-(
"I love it when technology comes together and makes my life so much easier!!! Celtronix was on point with their Multi-Port Quad USB 4 Port Wall Charger! I do own another adapter that is similar to this that I keep at home; this one will be utilized at work amongst my coworkers and I.<br /><br />My coworkers love to see what new gadgets I get and was very pleased to see that I had something for all of us to use!! We are not allowed, well, not supposed to, use the computers at work to charge our phones for fear of viruses and what not. So we no longer have that issue!<br /><br />At work, we literally have one power outlet for all of us to share. I brought this nice Quad USB Wall Charger in and one would have thought we hit the lottery! They were so pleased all 3 of us got to use the wall outlet at the same time with the use of this handy piece of equipment.<br /><br />Prior to using this USB Wall Charger at work, I tested it at home. I made sure to check for warmness or any hot feelings to touch to the USB charge, wall outlet, and cable cords. My findings were a tad bit of warmness. The charger did not over heat nor did I find any problems to my charging cord.<br /><br />We are pleased with this device and have not complaints. It is compact, lightweight, easy to use, store, and travel with.<br /><br />I was chosen to review this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
"Fantasic charger.<br /><br />Charged iphone 6 and galaxy s6 simultaneously from 0 - 100 in about one hour.<br /><br />Also, it's really small and sleek. Love it."
"Do not buy from this company. I just relieved my iPhone case and it is complete junk. First if all, it says it's a speck case. It most definitely is not. The word 'speck' is just screen printed on the cheap plastic cover.  The picture shows impact rubber along the edges. False.  It doesn't have any.  It's literally the cheapest, flimsiest case I have seen. Do not waste your money."
I like it.
Great
it's sweet!  so much juice. it's large size
Battery did not work. Would not take charge after waiting almost 4 weeks for it. Very disappointing.
Nice!
"Couldn't believe how cheap this was. Too good to be true? Yes! Warned me it might take 4-5 weeks to arrive from China, actually arrived in 2 weeks! Now the bad news: BATTERY IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS! Doesn't work. The battery light on my phone is red when the battery is almost dead, yellow when it is very weak and green when it is charged or charging. My phone's battery light now shows an exclamation mark (!). Battery does not hold a charge, does not even begin to charge. I took a chance...I got burned!"
I ordered a iPhone 6 Case & received a iPhone 5 case. 👿
"easy to use for seniors, even for fat fingers.  SOS button works well (my 2 year old accidentally used it!)"
Case is well made and fit perfectly
Great. Besides when talking on phone others can't hear you very good
My son loves it!
This phone gets so hot that my daughter has to hold it with a towel.
Very fast shipping. Quality of the product is great. Would recommend this to someone who just wants a simple transmitter without all the fanciness
Excellent
"It is the thinnest I've ever seen,love it!"
Returned this product. Not a good fit.
"Easy Installation and Love it!  Sound quality is perfect.  HOWEVER, I have experienced the unit locking up on numerous occasion since installed less than a week ago.  It will randomly stop responding to controls.  The music continues to play and change tracks, however, I'm unable to change tracks from the handlebar controls and if it switch to another source [i.e. FM, AM] and try to switch back to CD - it won't.  Its like my radio doesn't see the unit plugged into it anymore.  If i turn the key switch to Off and then back on, I am then able to switch to CD and control the unit again.  Anyone else experience this?"
A shattered phone is never fun - this case protects very well reducing the chance of glass breakage.
"Had the watch for a couple of weeks now and it is a must have for me. Works well with my Samsung Galaxy S3. Did have to change my messenger service to Google's to read the full texts. Easy to respond to a text via voice. Controls my music and the display is nice. I just wish the battery life was better and there were more covers for this watch. Overall, I'm pleased with my watch."
Excellent Thank You..
I love it when it works. Finally switched to another brand after my second one broke. Love that it cannot be seen. Love that it fits in my ear nice and tight even when working out hard. The range and battery are pretty good. The down side is that it is much too delicate. Breaks at the seams where you twist it to turn it on and the top most seam where the volume button is. Great concept. Needs major work to get it right. Will buy again with improvements guaranteed.
good all around
"Great product, price and service!"
The case is slippery - about as slippery as the iPhone 6 itself.
"My husband has two devices that he carries with him at all times his iPhone and his portable speaker. He was always getting the two charging cables tangled up in his car so this ended up working perfect for him. When he needs the micro USB charger he can just use it on this one and when he needs to switch to the Lightning adapter he can as well with no issue.<br /><br />The cord itself is flat and holds up well to being slammed in between the arm rest and the little compartment. It hasn't bent or torn so far.<br /><br />He also loves how the cord is black and the metal is tinted dark on it, he says it matches his car :)<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
"Love the ability to change wristband colors to coordinate with my workout outfits. However, the clasps require a bit of work to make sure do they stay fastened."
Very heavy and bulky (it's about the same size as my note 4) but it charges very quickly and is compatible with the samsung wireless replacement back for a note 4. The powerbank is made of pretty nice materials so it feels good to hold.
Awesome!!!!!!! Holds a lot of cards and the magnetic cell holder is brilliant.  I use this everyday so that I don't have to lug my wallet.  Everyone one that sees it wants one.
Having owned the original gear this is a great upgrade. I find it to be extremely well made and for me it's a must in my daily life.
great......
Did not receive the right case .received a iPhone 6 case needed a note 4
"Absolute garbage. Switches between charging and not charging every second or so, doesn't matter what position the phone is placed, and does this on three different types of phones."
love it :)
Now when I'm out I don't have to look for a place to charge my phone is the best thing we came out with I love it so much
This is a great case! It doesn't add a lot of bulk and has room for a card and a little cash (I ditched the mirror). The only challenge is that it it slightly too big for the docking station I bought.
"Works great, like it supposed to, would definitely recommend."
It's great.
Holds a charge great
"Edit:  Seller contacted me and apologized for the inconvenience.  Also sent a replacement unit, which also arrived really fast and is working perfectly.  Overall very satisfied with not only the actual working product, but also the seller as well.  Wonderful customer service, and definitely will be who I look at when in need of another one.<br />Original Review: Product arrived really fast.  This review is more of a 2.5 but I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Overall it's a great product and gets the job done, only issue I had with it is that one of the ports wouldn't work for me.  I bought this specifically because it had the 3rd port for an upcoming long road trip.  One for my phone, one for my ipod and one for my girlfriend to charge her phone.  Not really a big deal but it would've been nice to not have to switch the wires around while on the road."
Nice and very fast delivery
Love it! Great color and easy to fit on phone.
These things broke within 2 weeks or were not compatible with my IPhone 6.
"I did not want to pay the price for Samsungs wireless charger. I found this one and gave it a try. It may not charge as fast as Samsungs, but it definitely gets the job done. The blue light looks good as its charging. Just an FYI if you use this by your bed at night, it will definitely light up the room. As it charges the blue light turns on and off. When it is charged the blue lignt turns solid. Overall its great and I would recommend it."
I was not happy with it. Only be cause I thought it was a hard case not just a cover.
"Purchased for a colleague, he seems to be getting on fine with it"
Fits well and not impossible to put on the phone.
"The only reason I did not give the phone case 5 stars was the cut out for the on and off was much to small. I had to make it bigger.  It took a  quite a while  I needed to use a knife, scissors  and a nail clipper.  I finally got it big enough and now it is fine.  The case was  a great price and it arrived much quicker then they estimated."
"I've used this at a water park, amusement park, and the beach. The Velcro strap stay on my arm for all of the roller coasters and I was able to record the ride. I had it in the ocean completely submerged at some point and it worked! Some water got into the top plastic sealing part but that was it. It never got to my phone. Totally worth it!"
I'm just giving it one star for the COLOR .. I dropped my phone ONCE and the case cracked in three places and it wasn't even a deep fall .. not even a 2ft jump .. I literally just had my phone case for three days and it's already broken ..
Good
I've bought so far 3 of these for my mom & they have lasted for quite a long time (considering she stuffs them with cards she needs) very nice material too! So I'd definitely recommend them.
"My husband and I got this before a trip recently. It was so useful and we are so glad we had it! Whenever our phone batteries got low, we plugged them into this power bank and they charged right up. The unit has a lot of power and is perfect for airplanes or day trips when you don't have constant access to a charger. We didn't have to conserve our phone batteries and were able to use our phones as we normally would, taking pictures, checking email, etc.  It has a little pouch that it fits into which was convenient. It is kind of an awkward size and would be inconvenient to carry around if you don't have a bag or a purse, since you need to have charging cables as well. I always carry large purses, so this wasn't a problem for us.  I like that this power bank has a power switch as well, and it tells you how much battery remains. It has a flashlight on it as well, which I don't think we really have used, but I guess it would be nice for trying to plug in your phone in the dark. We charged this power bank every night (by plugging it into the wall) and always had enough power for 2 smart phones throughout the day. So convenient that you can plug 2 devices in at once.  If you can get this for a good price, I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this portable battery charger to anyone who uses their phone constantly!"
"I have a case but no phone. New phone would not work. Had to pay postage up front to get the phojne taken back..So, now I may be stuck with a case.. My son needed the phone but now I am not knowing about another phone by mail??? What if this happens again."
"This case is very beautiful and the highest quality you can get, if you treat your phone like a phone, you won't need any other case. It is exactly what I need and it is the EXACT color I love! Highly recommended to everyone.<br /><br />I got this product at discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Just what I was looking for. Great product for a great price!
"This really works!  Has been a lifesaver, especially during recent multiple day power outage in our area!  I bought one for me and my husband and we were able to charge our phones several times.  I just recommended it to a friend and he is going to buy one too!"
very nice case in a good price. Can't go wrong with anker products. Premium quality and slim design.
"Fast shipping. Easy easy install. Love that when u put it on its not full of bubbles, i only had one and was easy to smooth out. Im very happy with my purchase thanks!"
"Did not test if it is actually waterproof but this case is very flimsy. The door for the charger port snapped off and the plastic base cracked. I went through two of these in a month. For a better quality case, get an Otterbox. If you want to take pictures underwater, just get a waterproof camera. I wouldn't risk breaking a $600 phone but if you want to..."
Great conversation piece. It's not quite protective but it's pretty and crystals all around and the wine flows all over. It cracks me up personally. Looks just as pictured. I received this at a discount for my honest review.
excelente.
works great!
it good
worked as advertised
"Cables work really good, the different sizes that you get in this assorted pack are a plus. I earlier got a pack of smaller ones, but having several cables in different sizes works better."
"Don't waste your money buying this phone. I could use the phone only a year. its a total crap, no signal at all. I paid 165 dollars to fix broken screen. 4 month later I got trouble finding mobile signal and a week later no signal at all. After contacting customer care, they told me I again have to pay about 150 box to repair my phone signal problem. I'm so upset and thinking to buy another phone, absolutely not from LG."
I followed instructions unfortunately the fil didn'd adhere to the screen as it was supposed to. I tried twice to no avail.  I will never use this seller because the product is substandard and is not worth the price paid.
Ver y good
Excellent and very easy to setup and use.
I'm going to return it . It has problems
Works great for my ipad
Very good product
Son loves his case.
Great!!!!
"This case came fast and is very good quality. I'm using it for an Alcatel One Touch Icon Pop, as had read a couple of reviews saying it would fit ok. I easily cut out pieces over the volume and off/on switches on the right side, so it's easier to use those buttons now. The case is very good protection against damage, plus I've gotten compliments on how attractive it is."
We use it at work to connect Ipad to TV.  It works absolutely great.  We had to use it last week for a meeting.
Cases looked good and performed well - would suggest that the moulding to hold the phone be beefed up as the thinnest part breaks
The screen protector works great.
"I've only used it a couple of days, but so far so good. Long cord, fast charging, as long as it holds up, I'm happy with this product."
"happy to buy this one...more value than money. It holds my Garmin nuvi GPS and iphone (5S and 6) nicely without any issue. Also being on the dashboard means easy for visualization during driving. Other good thing is due to the weight, it stays nicely on top of the dashboard (even while driving on rough roads or on highways). I would recommend this."
"This is probably the 4th case for my S5 and by far my favorite. It doesn't even look like a case! The black is matte, and the gold trim is classy. I've had it for 3 months now and still looks brand new. No scratches on the black, no chipping on the gold. The openings are a perfect fit and can charge the phone with the case on. I haven't dropped it yet, so I can't speak to how well it protects the phone, but it's a pretty hard plastic so I can't imagine it's going to hold up if you're someone who drops your phone a lot. The text on the back looks identical to the Samsung OEM font so it looks pretty legit. I would 100% recommend."
broke 1st week !
Was working great but then stopped working after latest apple update. Iphones have technology to detect whether products are Apple certified. These don't work anymore as they are not Apple certified.
"Finally found something that is quick, convenient and not bulky. Highly recommemd."
"Good sound from both ends, does a great job!"
Nice and smooth~~
"Not much to say, doing its job well (Apple products)."
A solid choice to protect my S4. It makes the phone a bit bulkier than I would like but it is worth the trade off to avoid a damaged device. I don't use the belt clip as I find it too awkward. My only complaint is that I can't seem to get rid of a small amount of oil slick appearance caused by the integrated screen protector.
the small loop is too small -- the large loop is a fraction too big. guess i need to work on those biceps.<br />holds the phone and key securely and keeps both dry despite rain and profuse perspiration.
EXCELENT!!!!
Good
Fits perfectly and is very durable.
I couldn't get it to fit the wire size and as I compared it to my other terminals I noticed the hole was much smaller. But once I took the insulation off I realized it wasn't. The opening is the same size. Unfortunately the idiots that made the insulation made the hole smaller than the actual terminal so you cannot put as large a wire in it as which are used to. I am sending these back.
"I like these devices. I bought two last year at the full price and gave them as Christmas presents.<br />This one I bought for myself and is working great.<br />It comes with a USB cable for charging, but my cell phone adapter works fine.<br />Con - The suction cup works better on a tile or glass surface than on a fiberglass shower."
"Easy to apply,however, smudged too easily."
I love it 😍😍
It fits a need in great ways. It is sturdy and durable and should last for many years. Thank you for this product...
"I use these every time I run, and they have been fantastic. Light weight, and surprisingly good sound. I'd recommend these to any runner."
"Decent sound..easy to setup. Great sound (for a blue tooth earphone) the design is good for making sure the earphones stay in the ear during a work out, but usage does give you some fatigue (not the fit it forget it experience which I normally expect from ear phones)"
As described.  Easy to tune.
They work fantastic
It was so cheap I couldn't put it in my phone. Ordered something else
The is perfect for its big button for my father with macular degeneration<br /> Also not a complicated phone<br /> Had to get a different SIM card for it to work for ATT.<br />The signal goes from 2 bars to no service constantly and this is without moving. My parents would call someone and it would ring on the callers end but phone would lose signal at some point in ringing And my parents would have to keep trying. The call receiver would pick up phone but my parents weren't there since the phone not lose a signal
Exactly what i was looking for. fits right into my little home office and I can charge 2 kindles and cell phones as well. arrived on time in perfect condition.
"I like everything about it except for when I take pictures with flash. I thought something was wrong with my phone. When I take pictures with the flash while the case is on, my pictures have an orange hue to them. So I either have to be in a place with great lighting or deal with the orange hue."
"Really keeps things dry. However, the touch screen can be unresponsive under water."
"Perfect fit, as described and arrived early. Protects phone very well."
"After 5-hour long workouts....I can say that I am loving my experience with these.<br />I recommend them. Personally, I can not vouch for how they deal with running, but on a step climber and weight lifting, there are golden."
"As the headline states....<br />Pros:<br />- Small footprint<br />- Official Samsung product<br />- Cool futuristic-looking LED indicator lights<br />- Comes with 2 amp charger<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Positioning your device can be a bit tricky at first (not a big deal at all)<br />- Doesn't charge as fast as the cable (Galaxy Note 5 has wireless quick charging tech - so not applicable for Note5)<br />- It could be a tad bit larger... I was surprised as to how small it was (TWSS)<br /><br />This is the future, my friends... I can't imagine how I've charged my phone without it for all these years... 5 Stars."
"Fits the phone perfectly and doesn't make the phone super bulky.  I wasn't sure about spending the money for the case, but with the price of the phone I decided not to be a cheapskate.  I am and &#34;older&#34; person and am pretty careful/easy on my phone but boy am I glad I got this case. First drop --  My 18 month old granddaughter pulled  phone from my back pocket and it fell onto my concrete driveway -- I am happy to report no nicks, no scuffs, no damage!  Since then, there have been a number of other &#34;oops&#34; and everything still like new.  Good investment, looks nice, protects phone, doesn't impede any of the phone functions - what more could you ask for.  Recommended purchase."
I reviewed it in great time and it fits perfect!!! Thank you!!!
"They work, they look good, they're NOT a right angle (which I dislike, so that's a pro! Haha) and they're simply cheap. A 3 pack of things that just work. I gave one to two of my friend's because they're cheap and I didn't need 3. It's just an easy buy. (:"
Seems to keep up with my ipad
"My only suggestion to the manufacturer is that the support arm also have an up/down adjustment to accommodate cars with slanted dash boards (civics, etc.)"
Mom actually uses it.
"I bought this case for my husband's phone because he needs to carry his phone to work in a safe place, and this case does a very good job, it has a little stand in case you want to put the phone in the table and watch videos, the case is very resistant and He already dropped his phone several times and the phone is intact as the case too! Nice product!!!"
Awesome!!!! Love it in my cobalt
Really cheap and easy to install
Works Great. Just as advertised.
Love it. Work great with my Note 5. It say fast charging on the display when you plug it in. Take about 90 min to fill it up from 5-100%.
"As many have pointed out, this unit has some shortcomings but keep in mind, you cannot compare this low cost unit with a unit costing much, much more. Personally, I think the vx7020 is the best value out there when you compare the features to the cost. To me the radio quality seems as good as any other radio I've had but although I like to listen to the radio I am not an audiophile. I installed this to replace a dash top Garmin GPS and Jabra Tour hands free speaker, both excellent products. Like any all-in-one unit, I didn't expect this to do each function as well as the dedicated units but I was looking to reduce clutter and wires and this fit the bill perfectly.  After using it for a couple of weeks I am very happy with the purchase. Other than downloading the free map upgrade from naviextras.com (see below) I haven't found anything that I am not happy with. Like anything new it takes some getting used to but I like the nav software much better than the Garmin and haven't found any of the functions to be frustrating (like on the Garmin when I am an hour from Springfield, MA and do a search for the city 'Springfield' it comes back with a list of Springfields in Missouri, California, Texas, Montana..., and finally Massachusetts. No rhyme or reason to the order). In fact, the search and results are much better than the Garmin in my opinion. It's obviously using the same maps. There is a left turn at an intersection near my house that I take most every day. If I have set a route to follow the Garmin would tell me to go straight through the intersection, make a u-turn, then come back and take a right (like a left turn is not allowed). The vx7020 does the exact same thing.  If you are going from stand-alone units to an in-dash unit you are going to find some differences common to all in-dash units and the vx7020 is no different.. 1. Sun glare - When the sun is shining in a side window it is very difficult to see the screen. You cannot just change the angle like a dash-top unit 2. Updates -  You cannot just plug this into a USB port on your computer and run updates. As it turns out, there is a micro SD card plugged into this unit right next to the USB connection. For some reason it seems to be a big secret as it isn't highly documented. When updating the maps (free for the first time within 30 days of activating the unit) you need to remove the micro SD and use the navitools (crappy tool and worse support) to install the updates 3. Programming - If you are going to manually enter all your nav favorites, stations, etc. it is a pain to have to sit in the car rather than just taking a dash-top into your house. If you do a lot at once you are sure to end up with a sore neck from leaning over to see the screen. 4. Less clutter - The interior of your car is much cleaner without the clutter on your dash or stuck to your windshield and wires running to the power outlets 5. Integration - I love the sound integration when you get a call and it automatically cuts out the radio and announces the call. This is very comparable to units from the manufacturer costing thousands as an option in a new car.  For this Jensen vx7020 specifically: - The big problem with this unit is dealing with the naviextras.com site to get the free upgrade. What a bunch of bozos. I have Macbook and Linux computers, no Microsoft Windows. To get the upgrade you can only do it with a Windows computer using their tool. The website support and email support are extremely difficult to use due to language issues. Personally, I admire anyone who can communicate in more than one language as I only know English. But I can't believe it when a company offers tech support and doesn't care enough to hire someone fluent in the language to write a description or provide an explanation. On this site you'll find incomplete sentences, or incomplete thoughts, references to things that do not exist (&#34;See list below&#34; although there is no list below), etc. They obviously don't careabout customer support or at least not as much as saving money. That is my only rant with this product... - This is minor but frustrating - I cannot believe they do not include six to eight screws to attach support brackets if needed. Maybe the support brackets should include screws but Jensen knows the thread size required and really, would it seriously affect their bottom line if they included $.25 worth of screws?. As it is, when you get to the point of getting ready to install this you need to put everything on hold while you run down to the local hardware store for a few screws... This gives you an idea of how much I like this vx7020 when my big gripe is not getting a few cents worth of screws... - I was all set to rant that I couldn't turn off nav voice and leave the radio and phone volume on until I realized I just hadn't discovered the feature yet. Sometimes I use nav locally just to get an eta or know distances but I don't need or want the nav voice, especially with it interrupting the radio. As it turns out, you can mute just the nav through nav settings while keeping the radio on or using hands-free calling. There is also an easy 'mute all' by quickly pressing the volume knob. As it turns out, several things that I found to be lacking turned out to just need a little research to find out how to make it work. - The hands-free bluetooth has been flawless. The microphone works great and the sound comes through the speakers perfectly. - There is a frustratingly slow warning process when you start nav which basically says &#34;Don't be stupid and stare at the screen while driving&#34; which you need to acknowledge. The warning and acknowledgement only takes about 15 seconds but it happens whenever you start the nav which is any time you start your car. There is an easy fix for this though. By adding the lines below to the sys.txt file on the sd card: [debug] skip_eula=1 [interface] drive_carefully=0 This will bypass the warning and let the nav start right up.(Notice the part where drive_carefully=0=false). A big thank you to the person who included this in their review which I found along with information that an SD card exists, you saved me from a lot of frustration.  Things I'd like to see: 1. There is an option to have the screen time out and go blank if you are not on the navigation screen. It amazes me that the screen is completely blank. I would be great if a clock displayed. Every car radio I've ever seen displays the time whether the radio is on or off so I find myself looking over to the blank screen to get the time. I guess I'll get used to this but again, why not display the time, at least in a corner or something? 2. If you shut the radio off you turn off everything, including the Bluetooth speaker for the phone. My work around for this is to select a non-existent video input (to turn off the radio) and just let the screen go blank. I think it would be slicker to have the Bluetooth stay on (and display the time) when the unit is turned off. If I don't want to use the Bluetooth I can always just turn it off on my phone. 3. It would be nice to have a radio 'off' button. As it is now, if you want to turn the radio off you need to select something like 'Bluetooth' or an input that has no connection. I guess I'll get used to it but a on/off button for the radio would be a nice little feature. Obviously this would be partially taken care of by implementing my previous comment. 4. Again, you can't expect this vx7020 to have all the features of a stand-alone device but to me it is pretty basic to have the capability to use Siri or 'Hey Google' or whatever voice capability your phone has directly from the deck. In order to use Siri to dial I need to make sure my phone is handy so I can press the Siri button. It works fine through the system once Siri is awake but why not just have a button to push on the vx7020 screen to initiate Siri? Maybe I was just spoiled with this feature on the Jabra Tour. At the very least itshould accept voice commands to dial the phone hands-free. As it comes, the only way to dial your phone is to punch in the numbers on the screen or scroll through your phonebook to find it, neither one of which is a good idea to do while driving. 5. All the components are there, a microphone and speakers and nav unit. Why not make the leap and add voice commands to the unit for navigation and dialing?  Overall I think this is a great unit. When you consider the low cost it's an excellent value. It's not perfect but the deficiencies are minor. Even though there are some short-comings I'm going with a five-star rating because the cost is so low I have to overlook the few missing features.  After using this unit for over a year I wish I had spent the money to get a better unit and I've downgraded to 4 stars for the following reasons: 1. This unit is basically a computer. It runs on a Windows operating system and is frustratingly slow. Every time you start your car it takes a while for the unit to power up. I have to believe that if this was running on a Linux, OSX, IOS, android, chrome or most any other operating system it would be much faster. 2. Reason 1 would be minimized if there was an option for this to stay powered for say 30 minutes or an hour after turning off your car so that if you got out of your car for a few minutes you wouldn't have to wait for it to power back up again. If you are in a spot where you actually need the backup camera you need to sit and wait before it will come on. And the camera starts much faster than the radio or navigation. 3. There is a button on the main screen that says simply &#34;AS&#34;. The &#34;AS&#34; stands for auto search and if you hit the button it doesn't say &#34;Are you sure?&#34; or give any kind of warning, it just jumps right in and wipes out all your presets and sets them to the first stations it finds in a scan. Really? On the main screen? Not even one level down so that you wouldn't reach for your vent and accidentally wipe out all your stations??? You can be sure it wasn't a nuclear scientist that designed this 4. The navigation turns out to not be as good as Garmin or TomTom. The arrival time estimates are way off, given a choice it will pick the worse route to your destination, and like everything with this unit, it is slow - make a wrong turn and it's a frustrating wait for the route to be recalculated. 5. This has five groups or bands of presets. Two bands for AM and three for FM. If you switch from an AM station to an FM station you need to change bands. So say, just for example, you only listen to one AM station and one FM station. You are listening to your AM station and want to switch to your FM station. You need to change bands to AM2, then to FM1 and then select your station. To switch back to your AM station you need to change bands to FM2, then FM3, then AM1 and select your station. And guess what? It's a slow process to change bands. Any modern digital radio allows you to set presets to a combination of AM and FM in the same grouping.  I guess that's a lot of grips but I'll still give it four stars because it is a lower cost and I don't expect it to have the features of a higher priced unit by personally, I wish I had paid the extra money and got something that doesn't run on Windows or is better designed. It would have been a lot less frustration and more enjoyment."
"This clear case is great. I love that I can take a picture of my kids, cut it down & use it this case. I can use decorative papers as well. If you're a crafter, this case is a must. Never have the same case as anyone else, ever again. Silicone is flexible & durable.<br />I received this product for a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion, but does not constrict me to give a positive rating."
"Took me 30 seconds to install on my cell phone, so easy"
A great deal.  Some people tell me they hear a slight echo.
Very satisfied with this phone case..  Shipped promptly and was as described.
Great product
Great deal and saved me from paying for an insurance claim!
Nice screen protector
does a great job of keeping my phone mounted to the air vent. it has only once fell off after a large speed bump.
The long cable along with its illumination is just what I was looking for... Great product!
"I absolutely love these. I have really weird shaped ear canals apparently as essentially no ear bud will stay in my ears. These, however, do. And they're comfortable. Which is a definite first for me. I wear them while working out and never have to worry about adjusting them. Sound is awesome as well. And I LOVE the fact they're Bluetooth. No more forgetting your earphones are plugged into your phone and dancing around your kitchen and watching your precious piece of technology fall to the floor (not that I've ever DONE that...;) lol) even better, I can leave my phone plugged in in the living room and still listen to music while cooking. The ONLY thing I could possibly gripe about, and that's rather petty, I have a small head so the band on the back doesn't fit snug to my head. but once on I normally don't even notice it."
Great seller. Fast delivery. Product as described. Thank you!
I never would have imagined that something like this would be this fun!  The cat especially loves it.  I run it all over the room and the cat chases it like crazy.  The AR part of the sphero is especially awesome!
works as promised
"I bought this to plug into the USB port in my car so that two phones can charge at the same time.  I plugged it in, but then decided that I wanted it the other way around.  When I tried to pull it out, the red piece came apart from the silver piece (that plugs into the port).  I was able to push them back together, but it feels like it would come right back apart and won't stand up to being plugged and unplugged more than a couple of times.  Thankfully I don't need to move mine again, but it you're thinking about moving this around between different plugs, beware that it is cheaply made (I think made in China) and you might want to look elsewhere."
Nice!
"Excellent product. Holds my HTC phone well in both convertible and SUV. No problems with heat or vibration, phone and mount stays in place."
Works well and reliably. A basic dual USB wall charger.
Waste of money...tips don't  register on screen taps.
They do not work.... they suppose to be rapid but they are not
Stays put beautifully. A great way to safely hold your cell phone.
Work excellent
"If you want rigid and sturdy, these work for that."
"This has got to be the best portable power bank I have owned! I have owned a few of the &#34;lipstick&#34; style chargers/power banks, and all of the other power banks that I have owned don't hail in comparison to this one. It is much bigger and heavier (almost 9oz) than the other ones I had in the past, but it is still very portable. It feels like a cell phone when carrying it. This thing charges so fast and it charges very well also! I didn't receive the annoying &#34;slow charging&#34; message when I charged my Galaxy Note 3 like I did with my other power banks and chargers. I love that it stays cool with charging. There is also an LED indicator that tells you how much charge is left in the pack, but to see the indicator, you have to press the power button. It doesn't stay on. That's not a big deal for me. When I turn it on, I can know how much charge % is in the in the powerbank, so I don't need to see it the whole time the device is charging. I love that this charges anything USB! I was able to charge my phone, iPod, Bluetooth headphones, and camera with no issues. This is so convenient to have when on trips and wall outlets aren't always easily accessible. I can make sure I always have power on long car rides, when I am out and about sight-seeing, or when I can't find my product chargers. It does take a while to charge the actual power bank, but in all honesty, what would you expect from a charger with this capacity? I've needed a new one, so the opportunity presented its self to get one at a discount in exchange for a review. I couldn't pass it up! It truly is an amazing charger!"
It didn't work and I was disappointed.
Works as it should.  No problems.
not working now.. not sure where the issue is though.
Thankyou
Unit did not work (would not charge) out of the box.
Does not charge your iPod while plugged in the car. Rendered it worthless for me.
Great
I love this soooooo much!
Quality is excellent<br />very worth the price
"Very cheaply made, the first time I removed it the plastic area near the volume buttons broke."
Very suitable replacement for the original Samsung battery. Went from pulling barely 1 and 1/2 hours of screen on time back to upwards of 3 and 1/2 to 4 and 1/2 hours screen on time depending on usage.
I've used this maybe 10 times and it's started giving me problems!
Everything is alright. I like the phone and the back leather. Also nice camera
"It’s not smooth, I feel sticky while swiping. Need to buy another."
Great!
"This is a great phone case/clip. It's lasted me since Oct. 2014. I work as a manager in a quick-service restaurant, so the fact that it's lasted that long is a surprise to me. The case is still fine, but the holster is what broke when I ran into the side of a door casing. :-/<br /><br />The only negative that I could think of is that the holster does not hold the phone tight enough to have it held sideways. The phone sort of just drops into it. There is some retention, but not much.<br /><br />It's great in every other way, it's light, doesn't block anything on the phone, and doesn't add much to the phone as far as dimensions go."
Fit my iPhone 6 like a glove.
"I have been using this case while wade fishing on the Texas gulf coast for about three months and it is absolutely stellar. I am able to bring my phone to snap a quick fish picture so I can release fish but still have proof/ a nice memory of the moment. The silicone covering over the screen works surprisingly well wet or dry and there have been absolutely no leaks to date. The only thing you are missing with this case is access to the side buttons, but who cares.<br /><br />Very well-working product, get it."
I had this for only a month and the charging port just broke off inside my phone when i was taking my phone out of it. It has to be a defective device and now I can't return it. I expected this device to last longer.
"I had high hopes for this battery, after reading all the reviews. I received it 2 days earlier than expected, which was great. However, after it was installed, the battery came with a charge at 26% and would not charge anymore. I tried several chargers, but no luck. This product was a disappointment and a waste of time. Try at your own risk."
Works great attached to my tripod to take product pictures with my light box
Great leather case
The closure tab became frayed two and half months after purchase.
perfect fit.
Thank you
Very happy with it
So. so cute. I love them. I tie up all my phone wires/Kindle wires too. My favorite one is the pink piggie... LOL
"Great case, my daughter loves it!"
"Fits perfectly and is exactly like the original. You will need a very small screwdriver to install, like the kind used for eye glasses repair."
I am extremely pleased with the product!  An excellent accessory for my cell phone!
Great Product
"good phone case, thank you!"
"Cute, but does not fit the Samsung 6 edge!"
"Though it is good quality and charges your phone very good. The material is very sleek and easy to fall out of your hand. They should have put a grip on this. Other than that, no complaints. Charges fast, and lasts a very long time."
the waterproof case works underwater I did the test that it said to do that worked great but on my case the part that opens and closes for you to charge your phone broke just two weeks after I put it on my phone so now it's no longer waterproof  I think it hey need to fix that one part or make its just the that was sent to me all in all the case does it job
"Excellent battery replacement, worked very well."
"Kid had it for 7 days, dropped it from a height of about 2 feet and now the screen is dark. Tablet's Wi-Fi strength is pretty weak too."
"I've tried a few generic brand lightening cables and they all eventually break.  so far, this one works great out of the box.  I've been using it for about 3 months and have had no problems."
"Love it, works very good and charges fast"
"I don't feel that the clear case offers much protection but my daughter has a gold iPhone and refuses to use a case to protect it because she doesn't want to cover up the phone case, which makes sense but  this phone cost a lot of money.<br />I was glad to get this for review, it is perfect for her to protect the finish on the phone without covering up her 'beloved' gold case, it makes me worry a little less that i twill get scratched up or broken.<br />However, we also have the black case with card holder and this case is fantastic, looks sleek and very functional."
I still use the case amd headphones and stylus and i actually was glad i bought it or my ipod would be broke by now
Fits perfectly on my phone
"I bought this to take on a recent trip to Costa Rica. It protected my iPhone 6 just fine, but was a little snug with the case on. I recommend taking the case off of your phone before using this waterproof case. Very durable, seals out any sand and water that could damage the phone. The plastic is very high-quality and didn't interfere with the quality of pictures, which was my main concern. I would recommend this product to a friend."
I ordered my case and wasn't too sure about it because some of the comments but I LOVE IT!! Yes is so good got it right on time with two day shipping and in top of that that it comes with a screen protector and a pen for easy texting. I will recommend and it makes my iPhone more prettier.
Love the prodcut
"Screen protector is very different, but other than that it fits perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy s6 edge. I love how it protects the edges too."
"I was very disappointed with this watchI, I would not recommend anyone purchasing this product, I found it to be very difficult to program (usually I'm good at programming devices ) and in my opinion is very poorly made.  My plan was to see how I like it and then order a few more for my friends and relatives. Not only would I not order it for my friends and relatives I'm ready to throw this piece of crap in the trash. the only reason I gave it a one is because it wouldn't let me submit with 0 stars"
fast shipping and good quality
Great product use it every day
The three piece design is very functional and protects your phone too!  First your phone goes into a silicone sleeve then into a rubberized cover and slides into the belt clip holder.  I like it.
"Works great. I have an Incredible 4GLTE with a case on it. It fits very snug, but it fits. Seems to be made of pretty heavy material as well. Looking forward to see how long it lasts. The two belt clip options are very good too. Seems to be a well made product."
"Works better then I even hoped for.  Dealer wanted $450.00 to replace the the Bluetooth module on my 2006 Acura TL.  This cost me $50.00 and works perfectly, It's voice control and crystal clear.  The only negative but it is not the Jabra fault, before engaging the Jabra you will have to turn down your music yourself.  But saving $400.00 is well worth that one little drawback."
Works very well!
Works as promised.
"With the previous case, my daughter dropped her phone and cracked the screen; now we don't have to worry about that."
"After a few days, my ear started hurting. I have normal sized ears. Connectivity is good though. Also, only one piece is included."
"When it received a product, it was abandonment very much that a hook had been already broken."
Perfect
Great fit love the color. I'm hoping you guys come out with more feminine colors SOON! I love that the side buttons (volume/power) are all flush to the case and don't pop out. They work perfect. Definitely feel like it will protect my Galaxy Edge Plus. Loving the kick stand.  Thanks so much!
"Super cute, all the buttons are easy to use and the charger and earphones holes work perfectly. It fits perfect with my glass screen protector. The case goes over the sides for more protection and hugs my iPhone 5s tightly."
It works great and I received it very fast
Didn't stay in my phone
After seeing and using ours a friend asked that I get one for her as well - This is a great charger and a great buying experience.
"Awesome product! Plugged right in and started listening to music off my iPhone. Also realized there is an adapter to charge as well built into the device, bonus! My last one I purchased from Best Buy for $40. This one is a fraction of the price."
Its easy to use and usable.
These headphones are great! Got them as a gift and they're so much better than the iPhone ones I had been using!
I love these just bought my second one they really protect your phone from more than just scratches. no bubbles very smooth it's like it's not even there. Can't ask for a better price either most of these sell for $10
"good product it helps me a lot, when i'm driving just put it on my dash and will charge from the sun."
The wiring on this product was defective
Works and fits perfect.
Great and useful gadget.  I don't leave home without it and I never forget my iPhone at home anymore
Get many compliments
works perfect
"Fit and worked well, great price."
A Tom Tom will not fit in this model. I found out the hard way.
Love it and keeping it.
"Replaced my aging and unreliable GO PRO 2 with the Virb.  Didn't want to spend $400 on a new &#34;HERO&#34;.  Use it primarily for motorcycle track days.  It takes excellent video, and it is tough.  Unfortunately I crash tested it last month and it still works great.  Check out Youtube, type in<br /> creepy 847, and find JimC crash."
"Wireless connection with the ipad was an issue  and was resolved after contacting their company. However, even though &#34;Untangled Pro&#34; is recognized on Samsung 5, it doesn't work. I do love the wireless feature and think it is absolutely wonderful! My soon to be 4 year old is quite happy with it. It's a bit loose on her bc she's tiny for her age, but she makes do. Also love that it has the wire/plug option. Great headset! Awesome customer service!"
"I Love it, highly recommend had the case before phone arrived so it was ready. Once in the case which was a job but completely understood for what kind of impact it can take. I dropped my phone within 3 hours and was in shock cause it landed face down!!!!! But it was perfectly fine not a scratch or anything very happy with my new case Thank you"
Had for 2 days and it already broke. I have bought 2-3 of these clips already. Each have broke under normal/ light use. But the price is reasonable for something so cheaply made.
I stayed in NYC for little more than a month and for this purpose the card worked very well. The activation procedure was precisely described and everything worked as it was supposed to work.<br />When I go next time I would buy this card again if it is still available.
Doesn't fit 5S
"Product was received for free in exchange of my honest opinion. This product is special and different from the other iPhone 6 plus case not only because it is strong and of a very nice appearance but because has some extra value. It is very stylish and is built in Sliding Back for securely carry your Driving license, ID and Credit card. Slot will fit 2 cards and it is anti shock!"
Took it to our Europe vacation and loved it. It was sturdy enough for our SONY camera and worked great to take photos using the camera's self timer.
"The phone itself is great. The windows operating system is good but doesn't have all the apps you might find on android or apple. Most of the popular apps are there, but my schools app isn't available on it."
"I purchased these on June 10th, 2015. As of August 27th, 2015, they stopped working.  They were great until then. I got 20 uses out of them before they died. I had a replacement set sent to me, and now the audio will not work on the replacement set. I would say I've had close to 20 uses out of them again this time. I only charged this pair twice before having issues."
perfect
Totally perfect! Now I can charge 2 devices at once. Always useful especially on long trips
The adapter seems to work fine but the cable is garbage.  Seemed to be OK for a while but now unless I am physically pushing the connector into my phone it won't connect.  Several times I have plugged in my phone overnight only to have it uncharged in the morning.  I bought some different cables that seem to be connecting better for now.  If you buy this item I highly recommend you purchase some extra cables to have on hand when the one that comes in the package fails.
"It's pretty. It's light.  But it only charges my phone one and half times before dying.  If you want capacity, don't buy this."
"It works well, charging my i-phone 6 perfectly. I like its design and  gold color, too."
"Just like my headline says, this is a great product; Aukey Portable charger. Starting from the premium feel/look, to the vital function of it's Quick Charging capability, this product has charged my Samsung Galaxy S6 and my sister's iPhone 5 multiple times; $30 is a more than reasonable price-tag."
Great cover for my gen 4 IPOD. Easy install
Phone fits perfectly and it's really nice having my Drivers Licenses and Debit card with me at all times!
works as promised
It was nice
"This case is a good case. Lets get that clear. But, there are some glaring problems that they really need to solve before you buy this.<br />First, the biggest problem. The sides of the case are not tight, and the back came scratched. The scratches hide a little when you put a black custom back on it, but it really could come unscratched."
On a recent business trip to NY my coworker had one of these and was basically everyone's best friend. They charged up everybody! Had to have one of my own.
"I was very interested to try the F-Color iPhone 6 case in Gold color. The gold color was wonderful as it matched the phone very well. The case is a 2 piece design, where one piece cover the entire edge and the other piece covers the back of the phone. Th two pieces fit together beautifully and it is difficult to see the joints between them. It is so good that it can seem like it is not a case but a part of the phone. Very nice fit and look. There is a hole for the apple logo and the phone looks very good with the case.  I have purchased F-Color cables in the past and they are built to last... so it was not a surprise that this case is tight and strong.<br /><br />Now this case does not have soft rubber cushions and it is not designed for very rough treatment. Other cases may go after the abusive handling and trying to withstand falls from high altitudes. But this is an elegant case that will protect the phone for normal wear and tear. I am very pleased with the look, fit and feel of this case.<br /><br />However, there is a major problem that I encountered. I use 3rd party charger cables and I use F-Color charger cables. I have not had an F-Color cable fail on me yet. I have had to replace many other 3rd party cables as they seem to die to quickly. So it was a surprise to me when I could NOT get the F-Color charging cable to fit into the phone with the F-Color phone case. The F-Color cable has a plastic end that is slightly larger than the original iPhone charging cable. The iPhone cable will fit and function with the F-Color case. The F-Color cable would NOT fit with their own F-Color case. The hole in the F-Color case is just a little bit too small. I was shocked.<br /><br />So I took the phone out and reinstalled the F-Color case as I must have done something wrong. It still would not fit. It seems that the F-Color case is a little longer than the phone and the charger plug can not insert far enough into the case to connect. The hole in the case also needs to bea little larger.  There seemed to be no adjustment or positioning that enabled the charging cable to insert properly.  I am so amazed that their own F-Color case will not work with their own branded cables. My previous case can use the F-Color cables and they fit perfectly.<br /><br />This is the only problem I see with the case. If you only use the original iPhone charging cable then the case works fine. However if you use cables with the larger plastic ends, like I do, then the phone case will not allow the phone to be charged. So this is a major problem and this not acceptable for me. I have returned to my prior case where everything works perfectly. Sorry, but I want my case to work with 3rd party charging cables. The hole in the case should be slightly larger allowing ALL cables to work properly."
working perfect
Poorly made but I guess you get what you pay for.
Case is weakest performer. Rubber coating tends to come off with use. Charger works good. Have not used the clear film as screen protectors as mine are still good.
Great product
Very good
"Works well.  Fast shipping.  Some static experienced, but that is a result of driving in the city."
It had good reviews so I bought it.  I've tried to tighten it hard but it won't stay upright.  Little bumps make it move and I certainly can't use it on a mountain bike.
Was delivered early and tastes great! Works well for me since I have stopped smoking cigarettes!
Purchased for my wife and she love's it!!!
I like how case has covers for all the important areas like headphone jack and charger port... I especially like the belt clip holster... the only issue have is when I put on a screen protector the case always seems to make bubbles on the edges and it's difficult to correlate how to fit the screen protector on without the case messing up the smoothness of it... other than that I can't complain...
I'm very very disappointed. The rope in a sticker don't even think about buying this false advertisement.
A+
Cheap and works as it should.
Worked just as advertised
Arrived quickly and just as described
"This armband was way too big to fit my upper arm. I can't adjust the velcro small enough. I did manage to fit my phone in it, though it was a very tight fit. (I have a Motorola Photon Q with a case)."
"Awesome case,  just as good if not better then otter box."
"I really don't like the  types of mounts that attach to places like air vents, cigarette lighters, cd player slots, or use suction cups. I do like the custom mounts that attach behind a trim panel and are pre-bent to fit - but they are pretty expensive. If you're willing to tinker a bit to find the best place, this is a great solution and you can't beat the price. I used this with a Bracketron device holder which attaches to this mount easily using the Bracketron t-notch plate. I was able to use this without needing to screw it in anywhere on the vehicle - once I re-attached the dashboard trim panel it was snugged up tight. The three bendable prongs at the mounting end are great to get a custom fit. Very impressed with the quality and design for under $7!"
My iPhone 6 never fit into this case!
Very good iPad protect and good price too.
Just perfect! I recommend it!!!
Received a replacement from the seller and it is working very well.
Product did not work out for me but I was contacted by customer service and offered to try another product of my choice which worked perfectly for my needs.  I ordered a second one for my gf not only because I like the product but their customer service is outstanding.
Case doesn't stay together.
I love my phone case
"great for small arms, doesn't slip when I get sweaty like other armbands I've had."
"I was nervous about purchasing this item because of other reviews...but it's the best case I've ever had, and I've had a lot of iPhone cases. The buttons in particular are fantastic. It's like not having a case at all in terms of &#34;tactile feedback.&#34; I can't comment on the size of the holes with headphones etc compatibility since I use Bluetooth for everything, but my charger fits great, and I have no problems with reception.<br /><br />The only problem I had was that the buttons for volume have a piece of tape to hold them in place. That's fine, but the tape overlaps the edge a bit so that you can press the side of the case below the buttons and make the volume adjust. I trimmed the tape shorter and problem solved."
"When I got it, it was too small even when I made adjustments, make different sizes"
Solution for dead phone
love it
"I've tried many different bands and have had an allergic reaction to the metal on most of them, even Apple's $50 sport band.  And other leather bands aren't genuin leather because they crack as soon as you bend them.  This band is amazing!  No rash from the metal clasp and no cracks in the strap at all.  I bought the red and was so happy I went back to buy the black.  Only wish they offered more colors."
Fit great...went on easy and was better than half price compared to Verizon!
Fast shipping & great price<br />It's doing a great job protecting my iPod & my brother and sister haven't complain about it either :)
Always good to have a backup screen saver
I totally recommend this.
Exactly what I expected
"I have already tried several types of screen protector and all of them are a failure. A friend have used this and I thought I should try it. Im glad I did! It offers dust free screen, no marks and bubble free!"
"Wow! What a difference this battery case makes! Took it out of the package today and put it on my IPhone6. Ended up being in class for 8 hours (and we all know what you do in class). Came out of class and had a full charge! Will be great for trips, sporting events, and times when I can't plug in. It does make the phone a little heavier (obviously) but not so much that it would affect my decision to buy.  * I received a discount as a product reviewer but this has not affected the authenticity of my review."
This selfie stick was really weak kept turning my iphone 6 around couldn't return it because past the date I brought it so now I have tapped it. and ducktape still wont hold my phone steady!
Love it!
Didn't fit the phone at all! This thing would up sitting on the table until I threw it away!
Great durable case
Product as described.
Only received half of the case. Very angry! !
Excellent product for my new iPhone 6! Feels very protective and sturdy!
Love my new case!!
Great protection for iPhone 6+. Everyone loves seeing me talk on the phone!
"Not charge the phone, after a couple used"
Sucked didn't fit at all dont buy it!
Works perfectly with my 5s
I really like this case. It fit my phone really well and looks really cute too. I've already dropped it a couple of times and it helped keep my phone from getting scratched or breaking. Defiantly worth the money i paid.
Don't waste your money. It broke after few days of use. Not even a month.
Great item!
"The first one worked great for a few months, then wouldn't hold a full charge. They sent me a replacement right away and it's worked fine ever since. I would suggest they change the case to a softer material like silicone, but it sure is nice to have a battery that lasts several days!"
"Amazing. Great price, easy to put on. Will always be buying these from this seller."
I hate it. It looks good but while trying to put it on my phone it wants to reset my phone to factory settings or down load something that I don't even want or need. I can't get it on my phone completely without problems.
Nice product
"UPDATE: enviCAR reached out to me following my initial 1 Star review with genuine concern as to why I was unhappy. They have AMAZING customer support and honestly care about their product and keeping their customers and critics alike, happy. After returning the product and receiving a full refund, enviCAR followed up wanting to know more details as to why I was dissatisfied. As I mentioned in the my original review below, while the design and build quality are sound, they simply do not work with my vehicle. enviCAR generously offered a free mount (which they shipped to me VERY fast) in order to give as a gift to someone with a more favorable vent configuration. Well done enviCAR for truly earning my respect and this 4-Star review. Keep on keeping on.<br /><br />I have a 2013 Tucson and an iPhone 6 with no case for reference. Up front within reach of the driver there are two possible vents to use. When using the one to the left of the steering wheel, the phone sits awkwardly low and his partially obscured by the wheel. There is also no room to rotate the phone to landscape mode. When using the vent to the right of the wheel (which is rounded, not flat) the mount connects but is forced to tilt the face of the phone towards either the wheel or the passenger. The phone also blocks a portion of the ignition button and still does not have room to rotate to landscape mode. The construction and overall design of the mount is solid and packaged well, but it simply does not work with this vehicle. Also, with so few mounts up front, sacrificing a vent in cold weather months to avoid excess heat being applied to your device is not an option."
great
Do not buy this piece of garbage.  The item does not look anything like what you get. I am returning this item ASAP.  Don't bother with this product
Good product
i got the bluetooth earphone thank's.
This is not compatible with the edge. I made that mistake. But the quality of the product was nice.
Didn't work at all ? Never charged
Thanks
"did not fit phone, un usable...waste of money"
work very well
Cute and it's not bulky at all.
I've only own it one week and it's de threading already.
"Great case.. Smooth, clean, sleek n durable.. Yes u can get a 40$ or 50$ case n get the EXACT same thing but I like $1.99 much better.."
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Like these snug gloves.
"When it comes to easy to use, durable, and amazing phone mounts the Spigen Stealth is AMAZING! I use it every weekend when I drive for Lyft, and I get compliments at how sleek and out of the way it is compared to other phone mounts (and I have dead center in the car). I am able to mount and unmount the phone with a single hand, so there is never a sketchy moment where I am not holding the wheel (I never manipulate the phone while driving... SWEAR!!!). The only downside I have experienced is that some apps just don't have landscape mode, but Google Maps does... so yeah, this is a small downside."
"Works well but announces &#34;connected&#34; VERY loudly so be sure not to put in the ear buds until a couple minutes go by! I have had people tell me they can't hear me so well on these. However, other times, I have phoncalls without problems. Overall, recommend."
"I am impressed with the sound coming from this pair of Rio S earbuds:  Very nicely balanced; rich, yet lively sound; full and all-around sound like you are sitting right there in the same room as the performance.  Not an iota of sibilance to be heard.<br /><br />The longer you listen, the better they sound.  So give them their opportunity to break in.  Easy to listen to for hours, too--they are very comfortable.  For a budding audiophile, you absolutely cannot go wrong with these.<br /><br />The sound engineers have given the bass plenty of room to work its magic.  And vocals are very lifelike.  I hear much depth with solo singers, both male and female.  I hear that tiny touch of tinniness that I'm used to with a few of my favorite rock band vocals.<br /><br />Instruments sound really great:  Strings, guitar, reeds, accordion.  Horns are really wonderful.  Piano even more wonderful.<br /><br />Mic feature works fine.<br /><br />Comes with three sets of different sized ear tips, so you can get the perfect fit.  Fit is very important to your listening experience:  Don't be afraid to mix sizes.  Personally I need one large and one medium.  It would have been nice to see a set of Comply ear tips in this package.  If you are comparing this set to others in this price range, you will find some with an extra pair of Comply tips enclosed.  It is a plus.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the flat cable has a little too much memory and I can never get it to lose its waves.<br /><br />*I received a free sample product from Noontec."
Excellent product. ...
"I ordered one of these and the sliding door was impossible to open. I messaged the company to explain the problem, and they sent me a new one free of charge! The second case works perfectly--does exactly what it's intended to do!"
Works great.
"Perfect replacement! Unfortunately Callaway abandoned its line of range finders, orphaning the users. I have met a few who have taken umbrage with the company and are reciprocating the favor by not buying other Callaway products!"
I bought this piece completely assembled to repair my smartphone and after several months had problems lighting and image. it was reviewed by an authorized htc agent and confirm that this piece was not new and was assembled from different parts (recycled) has no integrated lighting of the menu buttons they are at the bottom of the telephone circuit. the back of the screen that I bought has features of being detached from other phone and placed the digital touch him.
AWESOME case! Really protects the phone and shows the aesthetics of the design of my 6 plus.
"No good, stop working after 3 weeks."
"In full disclosure, this is a review for a free product received.<br /><br />It often takes some time to appreciate if a product delivers on its promise. What looks great when you first receive it has to find a place in your routine as well as prove to be reliable. In those two respects, the Anker Powerport truly shines. After using this now for almost a year, I haven't returned to my original Samsung mobile phone or tablet chargers again. It's become part of my everyday procedure.<br /><br />The Powerport is a workhorse that hasn't failed yet and charging seems fast. (Turning off power saving on the mobile phone or tablet seems to help charging speed.) It usually charges devices faster than I expected, for example from very late one night to very early the next morning. However, occasionally, for no obvious reason I can discern, it does seem to take somewhat longer than I predicted. I noticed this as well with my Samsung chargers, so this may be an indication of some unreliability in Samsung's measurement of battery levels.<br /><br />Charging both mobile phone and tablet together has not resulted in any increase in the charging time necessary for either. That makes it extremely practical, not to mention well poised for the future with five USB slots, with more and more products featuring USB charging."
"I bought this mounting bracket for my Escort Passport 9500ix. It doesn't slide in smoothly into the radar, so every time I put in or take out my radar detector, it gives some trouble. Also the bracket looks like it's been painted recently, like it was a used bracket. Definitely not a recommendable OEM replacement mount. Still I manage to use it. At least it hasn't fallen off the windshield. I do sometimes have to press firmly against the suction cups because they loose some suction."
Not compatible with iphone 5s
Awesome
The case is beautiful.  Fit Right on my Moms phone with no problems and she loves it. I would so recommend this to my friends and family. One of the better cases I have bought (😊and I have a huge collection of cases).  I'm happy with this case.
Works great for my G37 and fast delivery too.
Excellent product. It doesn't slip on your arm and it fits perfectly.
"Works well ,not too bulky"
"Incredibly thin and cheap feeling, the image is awesome but there is NO protection at all. Also let the package air out a few days, the fumes coming off these has got to be toxic."
Ordered this product in purple came on time but the color purple was not as the picture it was more raspberry  returned  it!!!
its good
very bad product i can't use it as amirror
"this case for the price is amazing. Nice firm rubber, great color I feel its gonna hold up awhile. my only issue now is I need a belt clip for it."
I purchased the cables ~6 months ago. Half of the cables are not working anymore...I believe loose connections are causing the issues. I have other Micro USB cables (different brand) that I have used for many years without any issues.  Update 9/13/15: seller responded swiftly to my review and sent replacement cables right away. great customer service. i don't know if new cables are better...so far the cables are working fine. changed rating to 3 stars (from 1 star)...  Update 3/4/16: some of the new cables failed after less than 6 months ... wouldn't buy again
I have charged several iPhone and this pack never seems to lose a charge.
Unfortunately this battery did not wake my ipod back up like I had hoped.  Not sure if it was the battery's fault or if something else was wrong with the ipod.  My ipod keeps saying the battery is low so I thought changing it out would make it start working again...  Bummed out.  I ended up sending the battery back for  a refund--no problem with the return.
This was very pretty I love the BLING. It still lasts
Does not work with Samsung S5.
I love it. My phone keeps running out of battery and this is the only thing that keeps it alive!
This is a very nice screen protector.  It is smooth and glossy and very nice to the touch.  This protector included wing tabs for easy application.  The wing tabs were very helpful in applying the protector.  It kept your fingers off of the actually screen protector and it was very easy to line up.  Another nice feature of this product is that it went on very smoothly and pressing a credit card on it smoothed out just about every single bubble.  There were a few small ones left but that was a result of the one flaw.  This product came in a three pack and I used all of them before I got it right. The wing tabs are great for applying the product but once it is on it is difficult to pull the wing tabs off.  They are very sticky and on the first try pulled the protector back off of the phone so you have to re apply the top and bottom.  It also left a lot of glue residue behind on the product which was difficult to get off.  The second try did not leave as much residue but pulling off the tabs compromised the one corner and it did not fully adhere to the phone.  On the third try I put the protector on as before but this time I pulled the wing tabs off at the sticky part (had to &#34;pick at it&#34; with my fingernail) and that seemed to work best. No real residue left behind and the corner was not compromised.  There are some very small bubbles that I was not able to remove but it is not a problem for me.
This was a great case. Received in a timely manner in condition described. Happy with the quality of the product.
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
the left ear piece was extremely low..i would like to exchange it
Perfect. As described and shipping was quick.
"I have used C4 company model Q cases, and like them very much for holding business cards.  The SLITE model is cheap looking silicone, rather than textured faux leather. Also, the card slot is not wide enough to hold business cards- just credit card or ID."
"This cover fit my phone like a glove. It is slim, but not so thin that your phone would break if you dropped it. It is sleek but not slippery. I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion"
Good
This is a great wireless speaker. I purchased it for my flowershop. I liked the durability of it and knew it would last. The sound is really awesome and it is compact so it fits any where.
I've had no issues with this whatsoever. In his chores my son's iPhone five and my iPhone 6. I actually came to buy another one and cannot believe the negative reviews.
they are not what i felt they were going to be do to the feedback on them the sound were just ok and plus by turning them all the way up they are not loud at all. i'm sorry i have to give them a 2 star.
great product
Seems to be just fine but it is not a true Apple cord.
Been using for a long time super great product 😏👌🏾
"Definitely recommend it, the battery last long, clear conversation."
Purchased for my daughter who wanted to show off the actual phone.  She loves it.
"Very handy, works great for a multiphone family."
Not to many BLU case uptions available. For the money this is a great case with useful stand. My grandson dropped my phone a few days ago and phone is still in good condition. I am happy with this case.
Cute and well made
Love it
Cute!
This case is horrible I just received it yesterday and it is already coming apart this is complete bull s***
Magical lights and stuff!
Love it<br />Works great for my needs
Love these amazing price great quality super fast shipping .
"I loved this product when I got it, the look, the leather, and the color.  However, after two months the leather began to shred around the edges and the magnet for the closure fell out.  Needless to say, I have to order another case.  I would only recommend using this case if you will not use it to hold our credit cards or cash.  I think that the more items you put in the billfold part, the less sturdy the case becomes.  I am giving it four stars because it was good while it lasted!"
Got it a few years ago and still holds at least three phone charges. Not sure how effective the solar panel is though.
"Ever since the very first Android “smart phone” many years ago, I’ve owned more phones (and tablets) than I can recall. Looking at a few recent phones, I’ve owned Galaxy Note 3 & 4, Galaxy S 4 & 5, LG G2/G3/G4, Nokia 1520, Xperia Z Ultra (6.45”), and my current daily driver, the Google Nexus 6 (5.96”). Needless to say, I’m familiar with many models, big & small. :) So let’s take that experience and see how the latest low budget phone from Blu fares.  PROS:  + Excellent value as a phone and/or tablet + Nice looking 7” IPS Display + Very bright screen + Nearly stock Android Lollipop 5.0 + Great Battery Life + Smooth UI Performance + Expandable Storage + Decent build quality + Comfortable to hold, despite it’s size + Looks more expensive than it is + Factory Unlocked for GSM  CONS:  - Low resolution cameras & no flash - Mediocre sounding single speaker & voice quality - Display only 600x1024 (169 ppi) - Limited band support (i.e. no LTE) - Some light bleed - Loose Power/Volume Buttons - No accessories at launch  SPECS:  Since this listing excludes a few important details, I’ll note them here:  * 7” IPS+ 600x1024 (169 ppi) Display * 1.3GHz MediaTek MT8382 Quad-Core CPU w/ MALI 400 GPU * 8GB Internal memory / 1GB RAM / MicroSD storage expandable up to 64GB * 5MP Front & VGA Rear Camera (No Flash) * HSPA + 21Mbps / 3G (aka 4G) Band Support Only- No LTE anywhere * 3450mAh Non-Removable Battery * Full-Size SIM Required for GSM Voice/Data (i.e. T-Mobile/AT&T) * NOT compatible with CDMA Carriers (i.e. Sprint/Verizon) * Includes Headphones, Screen Protector, 2 Amp Charger, and 3ft Cable  DESIGN  For the first time, I’m almost comfortable using the word “phablet” to describe this device. It’s got the screen of a traditional tablet, yet has full voice/data functionality in a slimmed down package. I’m going to just call it a big phone.  First, let’s briefly talk about it’s size. This is a big phone, easily dwarfing my 6” Nexus 6. But it’salso a really small tablet. Compared to a Nexus 7, it’s noticeably smaller in every dimension. While you won’t be doing a lot of one-handed use, it’s still compact enough to fit in the pockets of my less-tight fitting pants. That's as far I'll on about size; it is what it is!  The phone has a mostly plastic construction, with bezels that look like they are higher quality than they are. The back has a nice rubberized texture that makes for a nice place to hold. You’ve got a front ear piece that doubles as the single mono speaker. Interestingly, the headphone and mico-USB port are on the top.  Power and volume rocker switch are on the right side, towards the top. They feel a bit loose and have some play to them. And the micro-SD and Full-Size SIM card slot are covered by a door that requires a tiny flat-head screwdriver to remove. Tool included. And yes, I did say good ‘ol Full Size SIM card. You can buy adapters.  While the textures and coloring won’t fool you into thinking this phone is made of high quality metals, it still looks nice. And the phone has a good solid feel. If you give it a firm twist, there is some expected flex. But no noises… yet.  PERFORMANCE  As you can see from the specs, this phone has a MediaTek SoC with Mali 400 GPU. This CPU is based on the ARM A7 architecture, most commonly associated with the Snapdragon 400, and used with some Octa Core variants. So yes, this is rather dated technology, except do note this is a Quad Core CPU. Not dual core as the original A7’s. It also has the benefit of running cool and being thrifty with power usage. We’ll discuss more on battery life later.  That’s all great, but how does it perform? Thanks to a nearly stock Lollipop 5.0 OS, it runs pretty darn good. Within the UI, things are smooth, fluid, and little-to-no lag/stutter is noticeable there. However, when you start opening/switching apps, the slower CPU & limited memory will make itself known. That’s simply unavoidable with these specs. With that said, it’s still relatively minor, and overall, runs better than expected.  BENCHMARKS & GAMING  While I prefer to focus on real-world performance and don’t usually put much weight behind synthetic benchmarks, here are a few anyways:  3DMark Ice Storm Extreme: 1922 AnTuTu Benchmark v5.7.1: 19590 Geekbench 3 - Single Core: 363 / Multi-Core: 1196  Not the best numbers, but how do games run? So far, they’ve all run just fine. Most games will lower details and resolution to keep them running smooth. As a result, you may see some grainy video or more pixels than you’re used to for high-end titles. Also, because this is a “less common” MediaTek processor, you could run into issues where a game isn’t compatible (i.e. SimCity BuildIt).  Temple Run, for example, ran great. Noticed some grainy images at the title screen, but that’s it. Asphalt 8 also ran smooth & was easy to control, but it’s much more obvious the details have been pushed way down.  OS & FEATURES  As noted above, we are looking at a nearly stock Android 5.0 Lollipop OS. It’s currently still only 5.0, it says it’s upgradable, but no word on when that will actually happen. Of course, just being 5.0 is good enough for now. In particular as there is very little bloatware installed.  You’ve got some Amazon stuff you’ll need to hide, they’ve got Opera, an FM Radio, Google Apps, BLU Help app, and not much else. The OS provides some audio profiles, reboot/airplane mode when pressing the power button, and you can even scheduled power on/off via the Settings menu.  They do include the TouchPal keyboard as default. This one is somewhat new to me, although I’m already finding it’s auto-correct to be surprisingly aggressive and incorrect many times. No worries though. It’s easy to disable.  DISPLAY  After using so many Quad HD IPS and OLED displays, it’s a bit noticeable when jumping down to a lower resolution display. In particular, this 7” IPS+ 600x1024 screen. However, it’s not as bad as it sounds. First, this is an IPS display. The colors are nice and vibrant. Black levels won’t blow you away, but they’re pretty good.  As with many LCD’s these day, the white balance is way on the cool side, which can appear as a light blue tint. Light bleed, while minor, is certainly noticeable. In particular when watching movies with a black background, in a darker room. Viewing angles are acceptable. Very little color shift; you’re mostly going to deal with notable dimming as you view off center.  Brightness is way up there. Indoors I rarely needed to go past 30-40%. Which is actual brightness, since there is no pesky ambient light sensor that I need to turn off. Although I do wish it got dimmer. In a completely dark room, sometimes I found it to be a little brighter than I’d like even at the lowest setting.  Back to the low resolution. How does it really look? In daily use, it actually looks just fine. The only situation it’s really an issue is when you try to look at a full desktop website in portrait mode. It’s here where tiny text and some images can look a blurry. You can of course zoom in, switch to landscape, or stick with mobile versions of websites.  Otherwise reading documents, flipboard, & e-books all look great and are quite pleasant to read on a larger screen.  CAMERA  We’ll keep this one short. It’s a 5MP rear camera and VGA (640x480) on the front. There is no flash. Basically, quality isn’t great for either one of these. Even with good lighting, the images will appear soft, grainy, and noticeably low detail. Clearly this was one area that took the biggest hit to keep the cost so low.  BATTERY  For a large 7” phone, a 3450mAh battery sounds like it would be on the small side. And if this had a ton of pixels and super fast SoC to push, it would be. But a low resolution screen combined with a very energy efficient CPU, and it’s really not that at all. So there’s your upside to low specs!   In my testing, I was able to achieve 7 hours 22 minutes of Screen-On Time, with about 12% battery life remaining. That was with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS all enabled. Screen at about 40%, which could have gone lower for indoor use, but I decided to keep it bright.  There was lots of web surfing, reading flipboard, and well over an hour of video playback with both YouTube and MXPlayer, each. Charging was also quick, getting up to nearly half capacity within about an hour or so.  Once again, your results will absolutely vary.  SOUND & VOICE  Interestingly, this phone shares the ear-piece for main speaker use. That speaker grill you see on the front/top of the phone is the only speaker on this device. Yes, it’s the same one used for voice calls. The mic is way at the bottom.  The speaker sadly doesn’t get very loud, sounds tiny at higher volumes, and doesn’t have much detail. It’s simply adequate. Given it’s movie watching aspirations, I really do wish it had another speaker at the bottom for stereo.  The microphone also isn’t the best quality. Test calls resulted in the same mediocre ear-piece sound quality and on the other end, my voice was slightly distorted or muffled at times. Even if I got closer to the microphone, it didn’t change all that much. Although both parties were still able to hear each other and carry on a conversation.  MISSING HARDWARE & BAND SUPPORT  You’re already expecting a few things to get cut when trying to hit a low price point on a big phone. So what are some notable items I haven’t already discussed? First, there is only 802.11n 2.4GHz support for WiFi. No 5Ghz or AC support. It’s still plenty fast, hitting over 40mbps on my router; it won’t break any records.  No NFC. But we do still have GPS & Bluetooth of course. No notification light. No camera flash. With only 8GB of internal storage & 1GB of RAM, you could run into some limitations. Although for memory, that usually just means apps won't stay cached in memory as long, and may take longer to open than usual. And with low storage you'll want to keep as much on the MicroSD card as you can. You've already lost around 2.5GB in system data alone. Most apps are getting updated to support SD card installation. Plus, there is an option in Settings to change the &#34;default&#34; storage location. Once again, up to the app to cooperate.  And as noted in specs, there are only a few GSM bands for HSPA+ 21 / 3G. Also commonly referred to as 4G by some carriers. That’s also the slower HSPA+ connection. Which on AT&T in the Austin, TX area, meant around 4Mbps down & a little over 1Mpbs up. Your results will vary. It’s not blazing, but it will do for most internet tasks.  To clarify, there is no LTE support on either the Global or US (my phone) variant. And will only work with a GSM carrier, such as AT&T or T-Mobile.  CONCLUSION  The Blu Studio 7.0 II fits into what may seem like an odd category for many folks, in certain regions. But for others, it makes perfect sense to combine your tablet & phone needs into one cost effective gadget. If you’re able to comfortably carry around such a large phone and don’t have a need for high-end (or mid-range) specs, I think you’ll be very satisfied with this one.  Bottom line, it has most of the important features needed to keep it useful and they didn’t get too carried away on the budget cutting board. Although with that said, I’d love to see what Blu could do in a higher-end category. If they even simply upgraded to a 1080p display, faster SoC, decent stereo speakers, and keep a fair price, it would be impressive.  In either case, all things considered, this one is definitely recommended."
"This is a great little stand for my iPhone and Apple Watch.  The stand is bamboo and is very light.  Even though it is lightweight, it holds my phone perfectly.  My phone has a protective case on it and it still fits.  The watch loops over this holder and charges well.  The cable comes in from behind the stand and the extra cable stores in the bottom of the holder. There are 4 rubber feet on the bottom that prevent the stand from slipping.  The front of the holder has a small indent in it so that you can still push the home button while the phone is in the holder.  I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
worked great.
This works perfect with both my Nokia Lumia and my wife's Samsung Note 5. So I bought another and it also works perfect.
"Terrible design, the on/off button is on the side which is easily pushed on with a slight bump.. Very hard to carry in purse or pocket. Charge drains frequently w/ode because of this."
"Piece of junk.  Apps crash.  Bad photos.  Can't send a text with a photo.  The first version was 100% better,  Big disappointment, I won't be keeping this long."
Excelent
Impossible to perform a hard reset by myself. Had to send it back because it is impossible to remove the battery and no procedure for hard resetting otherwise.
Fast Shipping.  Great product.
It is good product and good services. I like this Zagg always!
Product works great with my phone.  I'm a little disappointed with the stand capability. I have to lean it against something to keep it in the correct position.
Good fit.
No they gave out the second day
Worked for about two months then the cord started to pop out of the nylon and broke from there.
"Bought it on Prime Day. It worked great the first couple of weeks but then all of a sudden it quit working. I charged it via the wall socket and also tried charging it through my computer, both times the green light indicator was full but as soon as I took it off charge it died."
Great!! Able to use all my old 4s cords with this!😉👍🏾👌🏾
"Best device I ever bought beyond my exceptions and more,  Would recommend this to all my Friends"
Broke within 2 months. Garbage
Cheap and  convenient
No
It looks great at first but was broke soon within a month. What is the use of it if it breaks without dropping the phone? I did not even carry it everyday so I was very disappointed by the poor quality. Don't buy it. It's a waste of money.
best case i ever owned
Incorrect product - label is correct BUT does not fit. Check before ordering or else you'll end up returning like me. No fun.
"Very nice case. The rim sticks out past the front of the case a little, so your screen is protected if you place it face-down on a table. Fits snugly and never falls off, yet easy to remove if you need to access the battery, sim, or SD. Liked it so much, my mom just bought one (although she had to get a different pattern, since this particular one is now out of stock). I highly recommend this case, as well as all other colors and patterns of the same mode."
This should be rated zero stars. Worst electronics purchase I have made in years. This thing is absolutely terrible. I travel a lot for work in the car and in and out of noisy airports each week. The sound suppression not only suppressed background noise but my voice cut in and out. Tried different placements of the mic and found if I smashed it against my face you could understand me on the other end. To hear anyone when driving or in a noisy environment I had to smash the earpiece into my ear and hold it with my hand. Not at all practical or comfortable. I either received a very defective product or the fact this thing is on the market is damn near criminal. I threw it out the window while driving it was so frustrating to try and rely on as a business person trying to conduct business in our mobile world. Epic failure of a product.
I am giving these 2 stars because they aren't very versatile. The bar pins were too wide for a couple bands I had and one of the adapters broke while installing it and the middle button that snaps into place broke. I wouldn't recommend.
Good product
Perfect fit! Exactly what I was expecting!!
Awesome and easy!
"Very thin case, main use is for looks"
Tiny but great for the price . definitely worth the money
"I installed the replacement parts as instructed but once I turned on the screen, I noticed that the color looked washed out and that the phone's temperature monitor no longer worked. For me, these were minor inconveniences that I could live with since this is not a genuine Samsung replacement part, but rather one designed and produced by a third party. You can tell because the word &#34;Samsung&#34; is covered by tape when you get the replacement unit and there are minor differences in terms of the size of the home button, top speaker, etc. between the original Samsung and this unit. It worked like this until a few days ago when the home button and the back button ceased functioning and the screen would turn on randomly by itself. This started happening less than a month after I installed the replacement unit. I have also called the company several times and they have never picked up the call. Every time I am put on hold for several minutes until I just gave up and tried calling back later to no avail. I suggest STEERING CLEAR of this product and buying a cheaper cellphone to tide you over until you can get your cellphone replaced/upgraded.  This is not a cheap replacement and I wish I would have used the money to buy a cheaper cellphone rather than buying this unit to fix my screen."
"I found the sleeve to fit me just fine, with room to adjust to larger/smaller arm size.  The key holder and &#34;snug-feel&#34; for my phone is what makes this a good product."
i hate it
I'm looking to buy 3 more blue family and for is asking for this blu because they are doing fantastic
Great Case bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it. Took a bit to ship but it was well worth it for the price!
Very neat case. fits perfectly.
"These are Excellent Wireless Bluetooth in Ear Headset! They lay comfortably around my neck. The rubberish material easily conforms to anyone's neck and shoulder size. They are extremely lightweight. I love the magnetic pieces that hold the ear buds so when they're not in your ear they automatically go back to &#34;their home&#34; securely. The controls are incredibly user friendly. All the buttons are easily accessible and clearly marked. This set is by far the easiest set I have ever used to pair. You don't have to hold down a button or series of buttons for a certain amount to pair like my previous ones which I love! The sound is extremely clear and consistent whether im listening to music, taking a call, or watching tv on my tablet. They have a decent reach roughly 2 to 3 rooms away from the device they are paired to. The battery life is very good. They charge fast and last even longer. Overall I love them I wish they reached further but all the other features definitely make up for that. I also like that the charging port has a cover so dust and other elements are getting into the interior of the headset. I did recieve mine at a discounted price in order to offer my unbiased and honest review. I hope my personal experiences help you get the most out of yours. Happy Connecting!"
amazing product. gives a good backup of 3 full charges to my galaxy s4.
This is great!  Just the right length!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given a discount on this item in exchange for testing and giving my unbiased and honest review.
Works very well...
case is slightly to small hard to get phone in and out. i've only had this about a month and the case is already ripping. not very happy
"These were pretty good at first. I spent some time getting them to fit right, and they have stayed in my ears reliably for several-mile runs. To me, the sound is acceptable, the cord noise isn't horrible, and the battery life has been more than adequate.<br /><br />But today I started a run after forgetting to charge them. After a couple miles I heard the low-battery message, followed a few minutes later by a series of tones when the earphones disconnected from my phone. The music-less run was my fault, but now they won't charge.<br /><br />The red light stayed on after the battery died, and plugging them in to charge did not change that. Nor did holding down any one button or any combination of the buttons. I'm going to try to let them sit for a few days to drain fully with the red light still on...maybe that will reset them.<br /><br />I guess you get what you pay for, but a rechargeable device should be able to shut down and recharge after a low battery."
"clear and sharp, compact for easy mounting"
just what I wanted
Having the place to keep debit/credit card and ID makes life so much easier. Love this case.
iFlash has knocked it out of the park again. I have purchased a lot of iFlash items and they are always quality products. This one in particular has made my life a lot easier. I have a lot of devices that I carry with me and I use them all a lot. So when I am driving from point A to point B. I like to be able to charge all my devices. This one has two USB charging ports which make it really useful. I plug it into my car charging port and bam three things charging all at once. I am now able to charge my tablet and cellphone at once.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review.
Not very impressed. Wouldn't line up well and didn't stick for long.
"The only reason i bought this band was because it was &#34;Red&#34;. Its not red, its a pink salmon color. It also collects animal hair and dust like crazy. However, considering its $40 less than the Apple brand ones its decent quality. You get what you pay for."
"Absolutely perfect. Inexpensive yet it works! Simple to apply; not bulky; affordable. You can apply this with probably any case, since the cover is recessed by about 1-2 mm from the edge."
"Solid construction. Had a problem sliding the case open to use the phone in hot weather - very difficult to slide.<br />As a result, I purchased another case of a different type."
Works 100% as promised in the product description.  Would recomend.
"Fits perfectly.  You don't have to struggle to fit your phone into the case - it slides right in.  Covers the volume keys which actually makes them easier to access.  It also keeps you from accidentally hitting the &#34;silence&#34; button.  Haven't dropped it yet so I don't know how well it protects from shock. This is my first iPhone and I wasn't going to get a case, but this actually makes it easier to handle."
front camera DOES NOT work. really really annoying considering i waited 2 weeks for it and i use my front camera more than anything. paid $75 for a malfunctioning screen i don't recommend. my boyfriend replaced the screen and it took multiple time of unhooking the connectors and reattaching them for them to finally work and for the lines to go away on the screen.
"its not sturdy at all.... it did not meet any of my expectations... It's not worth it for me to send back.... so maybe I can find someone that can use it.<br /><br />the design is flawed.... the grip for the mounting area doesn't grab to much, you're limited to what it will grab... and then even if you do find a FLAT surface to get it attached to..... it can easily SLIP off when adjusting the phone or the angle.<br /><br />I'm thinking about taking off the mount it came with and using a much stronger grip from like Hone Depot and modify the mount..... if the mount was more universal and STRONG... then the movement, bouncing up n down of the phone would be lessened.<br /><br />unfortunately, I know there may be a few consumers out there that may not be too Technically inclined enough to modify their own.... and Kudos to those that made this thing work for them.... you must be sitting or standing REALLY STILL right about now."
"Only reason that I couldn't rate it lower is because there isn't any option for fractional stars. The battery is junk, was worse than the last junk batter that I got sold. It is from 2013, so I presume its repackaged junk?<br /><br />It also had identifying information &#34;redacted&#34; with a metallic paint pen."
WAS VERY NICE. BUT I ORDERED WRONG ONE AND RETURNED THIS.
"Complete waste of money. Took forever to ship, opened the package and it was thin, flimsy, and bent out of shape. (There was no way an iPhone would stay in there, but what should I expect I guess)<br />On top of that there was a tear in it! I contacted them to return it, and they said they needed a picture, I sent it. Did I hear a response?NOPE! Don't waste your money please! You worked too hard for that dollar!"
"Easy to use, simple set up."
"If you have one accessory outlet and a spouse, you need this. I used to get frustrated and angry when my wife and I both wanted to charge our phones on a road trip. The driver needs navigation running and the passenger wants to get some screen in, but both of us want our phones charged when we get it if the car. Thanks to this dual-usb charger, it's a non-issue!<br /><br />I got the black one. And it's the best looking one by far, IMO. The 2.1 amp charger charges quite fast, but the 1 amp charger is good enough to allow use with some battery charging. The whole thing stays fairly hidden from sight which is just how it should be.<br /><br />I received a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Said estimated delivery date was a month away. Received it in 5 days! Very pleased with product.
"I was a little concerned about the quality of this band after reading the reviews.  So far, the band is great.  I installed perfectly and the quality of the leather and buckle are nice.  I was a little worried about the length of the band, wondering whether I'd have enough band to tuck into the loop when buckled.  I was using the 3rd hole from the end of the sport band that came with the watch.  Turns out the new leather band is plenty long and I'm using the 5th hole from the end, so there is a good 1.5&#34; of band to tuck into the loop.  I'd definitely give this product a try, especially given the price compared to the Apple band."
Great product!
Review should have stated not compatible with cases. I'm not going to take my phone out of it's case and put it back each time I work out.
"*Updated Review* We had an FM transmitter I loved, but had to use an adapter and I was tired of it. We purchased this because of all the great reviews and I am shocked. There is constant static and sound when using this. I have literally tried every station from 88-107 and never found a clear station. I'm back to using my old one with an adapter. I know it can't be where I live, as my other one is crystal clear. I'm not sure why this one didn't work for us. ________ I was contacted by the manufacturer based on my review above. They asked if I would be willing to try a different product to see if it made a difference. I was impressed by their customer service--they came to me, I didn't even complain to them directly. I received the new unit yesterday and it is a completely different experience--nice, clear transmission. Also, I am impressed with a company that cared so much about my individual experience that they did so much at their expense to give me a better experience. Well done!"
"Excellent product ,  I am very satisfied with its performance.  It's the second one I have purchased.  With one exception:  they do not furnish a printed user's manual, only a PDF file you can download and print yourself ( it's 120 pages long! )"
had no glue to stick sucks dont buy
I love my selfie stick. We have tons of fun with it. It is super easy to use.
"I would recommend  buying the whole bracket with the screen in it.  It wasn't fun replacing  for the cheap glass to Crack,  in  less than a week after the install.  And the tools pictured were not with the package."
love my stylus pens.. great deal
I bought 2 of these for Christmas presents for this coming year. My daughter bought me one last year. Mine is a 15000mAh RavPower and I love mine so I wanted to get my daughters one too. I keep mine in my purse and if my cell phone needs charging I don't have to figure out where I'm going to charge it if I'm out shopping. They are also strong enough to charge a tablet as well. It is kind of heavy but so worth having around.
So happy I bought this when I did.  I bought this right before we left for a trip to New York City.  Works great charging our devices.  My only complaint is that it is a little on the heavy side but other then that love it.
Prefect
"[[VIDEOID:337a5584853242682937739abbe38f92]] I was sent this case by G-Hub UK for my honest opinion on this case.<br /><br />I am really impressed with this case, it's worth every penny.<br />It's really light weight, a great style with high quality production, the cut outs are great and the grip is second to none.<br />Great value for money, would definitely recommend it to all!<br /><br />Check out the video review on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPBFj113Tzo"
"I love it, is everything I expected...  :)"
"This case is the bomb! I never had one of these leather wallet cases. I thought they were to big and bulky, especially for the iPhone 6 plus. Let me just say, packaging was awesome (this brand specifically, has nice retail looking packaging. The 3 slits on the side are for single credit cards. I saw some people were sticking 6 credit cards and had some money in the wallet case, and were expecting it to close. Um, no that will not close.<br /><br />For the record, all you really need is 2-3 credit cards on the daily and maybe a $20 bill. No one needs to stuff this case with 6+ credit cards and tons of money. This case is for people on the go. Personally I love it and will probably end up buying the pink one since I have a white iPhone. The leather and overall craftsmanship is great quality. I would purchase this again and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a leather wallet stand case.<br /><br />I received this at discount in exchange for my honest review."
Excelent
Works really well and did not slip on my shower wall at all like my previous one I bought for 10 dollars more. I really like this product! My showers are extremely better without having to worry about getting my phone water damage.
Made a great gift.
I was very impressed when I got this case. It is made really well and fit my phone like a glove. It fits my buttons on my phone and I have no problem using them which I really like. The case itself protects my phone from being damaged. Nice pink and purple colors. This case is two parts and they are a harder plastic type material. I have to use a screen protector with this case to protect my screen and the case helps to protect my phone from being damaged.I would recommend this Iphone 5C case from MagicMobile. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.
"I have really liked this case. I love not having to carry a wallet and my phone. I wish it could hold more cards. I tried to put a few more in and it pushed too hard on the screen. You definitely have to keep it to a minimum. I read a lot of reviews saying it seemed cheap, but I thought it was pretty nice. I am kind of hard on phones and my kids like to use them too and this has held up great for me. I have had it for a while and I have had nothing fall apart or break.  I can access all of the buttons easily. I have dropped my phone a few times and it seemed to have protected it pretty well....no cracked screens yet."
"Great product, GREAT experience!"
Great sound and great support
"Had an excellent transaction with vendor. Item exactly as described. But, on to the actual case itself. It's a very snug fit, all the buttons and holes are perfectly aligned. Within minutes of putting the case on for my wife, she dropped the phone on our hardwood kitchen floor, not a scratch or even a mark. The only thing is the lack of directions, which should definitely be looked up before putting on the screen protector.<br />I was never a fan of 2 piece cases, but this one looks nice, has done a great job protecting the phone so far, and was an excellent value.<br />When I upgrade my phone(or my wife's), this is the first place I'll look for a case for it."
Great!
Bought it for my daughter and she likes it
never works
It broke the second day
This are nice headphones but my lgs have a better quality sound. .
"Love the case, highly recommend it ☺very good quality for the price 👌"
Have had install on my boat all spring/summer (about 100 hours water time). So far so good (better than expected and would recommend. Especially for the price.
good
"Selfie stick is built very strong, constructed like I would build it. Highly recommend the item as a great buy, it is truly what a professional would have nearby. Remote shutter control over Bluetooth performs flawlessly, easy to set up on my Samsung android cell phone. I would have no reservations recommending it to a friend. Engineering and materials could not have been mated any better. My hat is off to Fugetek, you knocked it out of the park with this item."
Terrific!
"I do not like this item. The elephant is discolored, and this case does not protect my phone at all. Why is this one plastic and the case for the 4s is rubber? I liked this case for the 4s a lot more, and I don't know why they changed it."
"I have the thinnest shock-protect case for my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, and it did not fit in the cradle even if I remove the plastic &#34;cover mate&#34; like they show in the picture.  FYI - With my case on the phone, it measures  3 5/16&#34; across.  Returned it for a refund."
Nice quality but as others mentioned the top of the clip digs into your side and is uncomfortable. I find myself not using it because of this.
"Works good, the ends are way too bright and the cord lights you can barely see. For the price, love it but had to put a small piece of black tape over the end smiley faces because it was so bright."
loved this case! I didn't like the flap at the bottom that covered the charger port. But other than that it was great
Great
Came on time!! The case in very light and works perfectly.
The original broke after about a month. I emailed Anker and they sent out a brand new one no questions asked within two days of our conversation. This is why i love Anker and always stick with them!
"Not perfect, but a phenomenal deal at the price."
"It dont work good , coudnt see a movie or netflix or youtube."
"My Samsung Galaxy S3 has a terrible battery life regardless of all of the apps that I close after using.  I try to diligently make sure extra apps are not running and still I get short battery life - nothing near 24 hours.<br /><br />The Mogix was wonderful in allowing me to recharge my phone while on the go during the day, particularly when I was out nearly the entire day on my recent vacation.<br /><br />I am extremely happy with the battery charger."
"The pro charge power inverter is the perfect accessory to have when traveling. I usually let my husband drive so that I can read or catch up on work. I ordered the pro charge inverter to charge my laptop in the car. The inverter is easy to use. All you need to do is plug the cord in your cigarette plug. It can charge up to four devices at once, two using the USB port and two with the AC ports. I have no problem charging my phone, my husbands and my laptop all at once. The cord is 36 inches long and will reach the backseat of our car. This device is perfect for my family. I received this item in exchange for my honest review."
Could not be happier. The repeater at Scout Camp was down and these antennas work so that we didn't need to fix the repeater the whole Camp session
Very clear sound.
Make the fire phone too heavy
Perfect! My tablet is alive again!
Love it!!!!!.
It didn't fit like it was suppose to
After having these for a year. They work the same then as they do now. I got two and wired them for 2 ohm. Oh also got a ported box sounds much bigger than they are.
I ordered these batteries as replacements for my wife's phone. A month outside of the eligible return window one of the batteries swelled and stopped functioning. Hopefully I can find a more reliable vendor to order a replacement for the defective battery they sent me that won't nearly pop inside her phone.
"Arrived on time, looked like the picture shown on amazon. No issues"
Great protection and an invisible finish.
"DO NOT BUY THIS CASE. I bought it early June because I was going to the beach for a week with some friends and needed to keep my phone charged. It worked great over the summer and my phone was always charged. However, last month the charger for the case got annoying and I had to situate my phone a certain way to charge it - got annoying. And last week, my phone started to randomly power off then signal that I needed to charge my phone, so I would turn on my charging case, and my phone would turn back on but be at 50% or higher (it never really needed the charging but it just said I did). And last night, my phone completely turned off and did not turn back on. The only screens I could see where the charging signal when I plugged it in, the apple logo would flash, and then a black screen. Today, I went to Verizon after numerous phone calls with Apple and Verizon, and after putting my iPhone in recovery mode on iTunes. Verizon told me my battery had probably died, so I went to a local computer store to ask for more help and they told me that my battery and circuit board were FRIED. Why? Because of this case. Non-apple chargers will DESTROY your phone. My phone did not like that charger, and so after these months it ruined my phone. My 5S (that I've only had for a year) is trash now - all because of this case. I suggest not buying this case or ANY off brand chargers because your iPhone will NOT like it. If you do buy this case, only charge when needed. Not everyday. I had to end up buying a iPhone 6 (taking my dad's upgrade) and it was NOT worth it. I am warning you - DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
Radio lasted 2 days and volume control was lost. Radio would be all the way up or all the way down no in between.
These products work for a bit then stop working. The seller is also not responsive to feedback. Do not buy!!!
"Very pleased with the Benuo iPhone case.  Good quality leather, well made and just what I wanted."
Fits great! Arrived on time. Thank you!
"Excellent to charge 2 simultaneous devices like smartphones, tablets and laptops while traveling in a car."
Great product. it fit and was easy to install
I bought this for my fiancé. She absolutely loved it. As soon as I showed her this little surprise she immediately put it on the phone:) great price btw. I'm super happy with the product.
So so very happy with this screen protector! It was the second brand I ordered because the first one I got was terrible and was promptly sent back.  This protector was the easiest one I have ever applied and it looks great! Thank you!
I wish this case was made better! Both layers are a hard plastic that does not work well with each other. Me and my husband got this same case for different phones in different colors and we both had the same problem. Our phones kept popping out the case. Whether it was a corner or one of the sides for some reason it wouldn't stay put. I honestly think its because the case is 2 hard plastics together vs. the alt silicone/gel base and hard plastic cover. We loved the idea of having the kick stand and the cool look but being functional is always top priority! I mean what's the use of added features to a car that doesn't drive??
"Great gadget to have. I was able to take pictures of 4 of us, husband and 2 kids all together. I usually the one missing in action, the &#34;photographer&#34;. All the pictures of vacations and fun times as a family, it was always my hubby and kids. Now I can join in. it folds small and fits in my purse, backpack. Sturdy and great quality for the price."
covers mouth area so it's hard for the other person to hear you
This cable was exactly as described. I've been using it for nearly a month and have no complaints. It charged my Note 3 at the same rate the factory cable once did (before I bent the cable constantly over a year until it weakened). This 3 foot cable is actually much more convenient than the 6 foot one that came with the Note 3 for my needs.
[[VIDEOID:b135924d8428172912fc2f7a7fb3739]] This mount held my phone without any problems while I was driving down a dirt road at high speed.
"fits perfect, looks nice too, very classic and outstanding."
Functions as advertised.
"Yes. Yes. Yes. I've had this on my phone for almost an entire year!!! It definitely is great quality, put it on myself and no air bubbles and if you do get bubbles you can easily get them out. Not like most protectors!"
"The armband is uncomfortable, difficult to adjust and strap is beginning to fall apart within 1 month of regular use. I will return this item and purchase something else."
"Phone case was packaged well, looks very nice and is proving to be durable. Great purchase"
Works very well!! Much much cheaper and SAME quality as ones you pay for at the big retail cell phone stores!
"I love purchasing items from Anker, they have products that always work and their customer service is nothing but World Class"
Good but feels cheap. Also phone only stays in wallet by cheap magnet. The phone falls put easily
Charges the phone just fine.  Have not had any problems.  Will try some more when on camping and fishing trips...
"Good speaker, very easy to use. Super loud for indoors or a small outdoor space. I was looking for something louder for a large indoor space.<br />But good, solid speaker.<br />Seller was great!!!"
Nice case. Fit like a glove!
Great product and cheap price. Nice protection.
Great case for being cheap. Plastic is weak and broke in the thin spots within the first week. Looks very slick tho.
"Great case, love the design."
I love this battery. It works great holding a charge longer then the original battery. Gives me more time to play games on my phone. This would also be a great back up battery incase you run out of power on the go. Using this as the primary battery in my Galaxy S III for 9 months so far and have only ran out of power a couple of days. A few times forgot to charge my phone at night or I was playing games on my phone between classes and drained my battery.
Received product and it was exactly as described. The charger is well made and very easy to use. I am very pleased with my purchase. This is one of my 3 Ravpower products. I have never been disappointed with how well they work.
Product as described
Arrived on time. Came in a small package with the lens that were in the advertisement. works great with my iPhone.
"This was the first Quick Charge 2.0 Portable battery I found available, and it does not disappoint.<br /><br />I don't even use my older chargers anymore, as Quick Charge charges my phones (that are Quick Charge compliant) so much faster (hours faster). This works perfect when you need a quick burst of extra power for your music, phone calls, gps, etc.<br /><br />The price is also competitive. Thanks Aukey!"
"Nice, and easy installation. I have been using this for almost a month directly connected to my car's fuse box a permanent charging solution for my iPhone. Has been working great so far!"
Love this case - one of my favorites
Bought for my Dad who loves the ease of use-
"these protect the watch perfectly, love them!"
"[[VIDEOID:8943003c9d2daf0b517bd419f9f13144]]This is a fantastic multi cable , this is a must for everyone .This is the ultimate charging cable , for multiple devices .<br />This offers you a:<br />- micro USB<br />- Lightning compatible<br />- Apple 30 pin<br />- 8 Pin compatible<br />- kindle<br />This works amazing with all our different devices , it doesn't give any error messages .The ends fit nice and tight for a secure charge .<br />I love this because I don't have to have a bunch of cables , you can have everything neat and tidy with just this one awesome cable .<br />This is so versatile and useful , saving money on lost cables and time looking for cables .<br />I love everything about this amazing cable and I can guarantee you will love it as much as I do.<br /><br />I highly recommend this awesome multi cable ,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
love the texture of the material so much better than most of the products in market
Works wonderfully!!!
Great deal
excellent product!
Exact item needed and received.....<br />Quick shipping and inexpensive!
My daughter loves this case
what is this!
Do not get fooled; it's not working with Nokia Lumia ( Icon or 930 ) as advertized
"FINALLY -- a long cable that works well with a Dell Venue 11 Pro.  I tried at least 6 other cables until finding this one, and it's the ONLY one I've tried (other than the ridiculously short Dell cable)) that will allow my DV11P to charge while in use.  This is not the cheapest cable out there, but I probably would have saved money in the long run if I'd just bought this first instead of wasting time trying all the others.  The green connector actually makes it easy to quickly spot the right cable in my bag, which is an unexpected plus."
I love it.
"Terrible, not supported by iPhone 6 or iPad 2. Amazon was great though and issued a full refund.m"
Perfect!  Thank you!
best back up battery I have owned!! this will charge my Iphone several times before I have to charge it. Love that it also charges my Ipad. Highly recommend.
Really nice charging cable. Feels thicker than my apple one that came with my iPod touch and it has metal connectors so it should last.
Good product!
Excellent product that works exactly as advertised. I wish the cord was a bit longer as the AC receptacle in the car that I am currently driving is located in the center console away from the dashboard but it's only a minor quibble as it still stretches sufficiently for my needs. Product arrived much faster (12 days) than was estimated. This cord is much better than the stock cord that came with my 265W so I would highly recommend this product to any Garmin users stuck with a bad power cord as I was.
My LG g3 look gorgeous I love........
Love it.
"Seems to work fine for a few weeks but......<br />As time goes by 1,2 have stop working.  I was hoping the new and improved cords would be better.  I have burn marks near the connector.  And smells of burning plastic"
"Best investment I made in recent trip to Scotland. It gave me a single point to recharge our phones, pads, reader, and toothbrush! A real life saver."
I got a lot of compliments
"I had so hoped these would be great, but they weren't.  Out of five I had two that worked occasionally.  You would plug it in it would say it was charging, look at it five minutes later and it would say not charging. Kept trying them for a few days, but pattern continued. Finally gave up and bought some cords that aren't  pretty, but they do work."
I love this case. It is such a two-for
Got three of these cases they are really great would buy again !
Great product. Works well.
It is big no doubt but the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired.
Junk. It won't hold the bluetooth connection continuously even with the band on your neck and the phone on your hip.
The product arrived as promised and is working wonderfully! Thank you!
"iCarez has always made the best screen protectors.  I've been using their products since the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and every time I have to install a screen protector it's a very simple task.<br /><br />This time was no different, very great product by iCarez"
It is such a nice case.  It looks like a wallet.  I love it.  It is a pleasure to hold.
Excellent
Fit good. Came with everything I needed to replace the screen
"Great little holder. It's meant for your car, but I also use it on my night stand to watch videos when I'm going to bed. It grips my phone really well. The only downside is the vent clip doesn't work that well in my truck."
"Thank you for such a well functional product. Meets all the expectations! Simple,easy to use! Well put together. Really nice. Will highly recommend it to others! Good work, good product, great service!!! Thanks again!"
Flawless delivery<br />Well made and sleek<br />I love the way it snaps in place<br />I'm ordering a few more
Great fit and finish.  Charges very well....haven't tested how many charges yet for my iPhone
Did not fit my iPhone 5 as it said. Would not purchase
Great product and at just about the right price.
"Amazing piece of equipment. I installed in a Polaris Ranger to drive two Pioneer TS-MR2040 8&#34; marine speakers, in bridge mode. It is a perfect match! It could fit in the glove box of a car or even a center console. It is the size of two beer cans and puts out the power of a 12 pack. The only downside is that there are no adjustments on the amp but at this point I don't know I would even use them. The blue tooth pairing was beyond simple. It took me about 45 seconds from the time it powered on to the point I had music blaring."
"How have I ever lived without this?!  After 2 days of having it, my mom ended up getting one it white!  One of my top 3 purchases of 2015!"
"Hate this device now!  Was working well, but with the last two updates of the Garmin Connect app, I can no longer sync.  Tech support advised uninstall and reinstall, which didn't resolve the issue.  No further help available.  If it doesn't sync, what's the point?!?"
My phone keeps coming out of the case...iPhone 5c
"Fits perfectly into the S5 with very little work needed. Wonky delivery system, but still arrived quickly. If my friend broke her charging port cover for a third or more time, I'd buy this again."
Pleased with this case.
Using it to hold my iPhone 6 with silicone casing on a BMW R Nine T handlebar.<br />Easy to mount and versatile when it comes to orientation: can use the iPhone as GPS or action cam both in portrait and landscape modes. Easy to set even with riding gloves.<br />Holds iPhone 6 perfectly up to legal speeds including on highways.
Love that it has a front piece and not just the back. My phone feels safe having the rubber internal cover and feels good to hold.
This is great for guitar players who use pedals. I am glad I bought this. Saves $$$$.<br /><br />Steve
Appears to be a great case.  Hard plastic with rubber edging.  Also like the screen protector that is included.  Have no problems using the touch screen with it.  I just wish the colors wouldn't have been more pastel.  There was a  darker purple one from someone else I liked better but didn't have the touch screen protector this one did.  So white is a good substitute.
Works great!
adorable! i WANT MORE!
I purchased this because I wanted a wall charger for some 26650 batteries.  It is unreasonably difficult to insert batteries of size 26650 into the charger.  plus they don't appear to seat correctly.  I returned this for this reason as well as the fact that it arrived damaged.  Smaller batteries will most likely fit much better.
"Just for the record, I am a HAM, I have 2 other UV-5R radios, there was no user error involved in this product.<br /><br />Out of the box this radio had no RX audio. The speaker works, cause I could hear the Chinese woman yelling at me, but there was exactly ZERO receive audio, even in simplex. Also, the transmit signal was weak with low audio, and would not hold a repeater what I had line of sight with (the 97 machine located in Paxton MA). Additionally, the antenna and radio began to overheat with probably 3 min of light use, while monitoring on another UV-5R.<br /><br />Bottom line: The radio I received was a total dud. Will re-review if this can be returned and replaced w/o issue."
I love it
Really love work perfect for my i phone and Lg G3 will order again
This is the last case you'll ever buy!!! Dog & Bone cases are the real deal and are superior to Lifeproof cases. I say this because a threw my Lifeproof in the garbage and took the chance on the Dog & Bone case. With this case I get the same protection without the muffled sound which is what sold me. Plus the case is far more pleasant to look at. Also their customer service is A++ they responded to my emails within minutes. Overall you can't go wrong with this case or company they are awesome.
Not what I expected
Perfect. Magnet is good and can hold samsung s5 and iphone 6.
Very well made case! I love it
"I have never used a monopod or &#34;selfie stick&#34; before so I wasn't entirely certain what to expect. I am a historic preservationist by profession and frequently in old buildings you need details you can't easily access or photos of crawlspaces that are too narrow to navigate so I thought that this might help take photos in such circumstances. Although I've been in the market for one for a while, I had not settled on one until I saw this one which seemed complete yet simple enough to use for a first-timer.<br /><br />Since I received it, I have done nothing but play with it! It fits my digital cameras, my phones, and the clasp piece which holds all of them can be adjusted so that it can turn into a mount for my regular camera. Even better, the clasp comes off to reveal a screw that can accommodate a camera directly! It's got a long reach. It's sturdy. The rubber handle is ridged for a good grip. It also has a strap at the end so it can be kept on a wrist for ease of use. I am so much happier with it than I had anticipated. Perhaps the best feature though is that you can snap pictures from the button on the handle! That's incredible!<br /><br />I received this for free in exchange for a genuine critique"
Works great
"This is a great product. Or it would be. However, it claims to work with apple products but when I called tech support for connection issues with my macbook pro, they said it isn't actually made for apple products but for android, and they are working on updates for the iphone 6. Box clearly states it to be compatible with apple. They offered to take it back but we now know how to fiddle around with it to get it to connect with the macbook. So we just kept it as we like the product, and we keep manually reconnecting it. UPDATE- even with fiddling around, it doesn't consistently connect. We've been speaking on the computer phone on speaker, which is highly unprofessional and unpleasant."
Kind of a loose fit but otherwise ok.
Awesome...love it
The old battery would not hold a charge but this new one has worked great .
"Very cheap, I ended up not evening using it."
Did the job
We have 2 polaroid 9&quot; tablets. We have bought a lot of silicones and they didn't fit...but these fit like a glove and everything lines up perfectly!
"I love this case . It fits perfectly the new Moto G 3 . It looks elegant , i got the black one , nice smooth  leather , no smell , magnet closes fine . It doesn't have sleep/wake function , but I don't like that function because it interferes in the on/off of the phone itself  . Good protection , the leather borders are a little bigger than the rubber case inside in a way that if phone falls it will hit the leather corner first. It has space for cards , but i don't use either not to add volum , plus , i don't want to use a phone as a wallet . Perfect case . I will use it until it lasts ."
"Sturdy, basic and subtle.  A great cell phone protector."
Great product very happy
I didn't even work for 24 hours. I returned it for a refund.
The application for it does not work and the watch does not connect to the phone properly. I tested it on a Samsung Galaxy S4 and a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active. Only call notification works but the contact name doesn't show on the watch. I will be returning the phone because of false advertising of functionality by the seller. The watch looks nice which is why I gave it 2 stars.
Purchased it for a friend and they loved it.
"Had an issue with my first shipped item and messaged the sender. With no hesitation they sent me a replacement and it works perfectly, my phone charges great and it was a very easy install. Highly suggest buying this product!"
"Seems to really do the job, only time will tell."
I love t
Strap broke and starting coming apart. Didn't even use it that long either.
"So far so good.  For running you defiantly don't want to leave the chord bouncing on your neck.  It makes a loud thud sound every step.  BUT... what I do is either tuck it around my ears so the rest of the chord fits tight behind my head, or just wear the chord on top of my head.  The ear pieces with the right inner ear hook fits sooooo good.  I love this technique, rather than an outer ear hook.  Super conformable and really solid.  Defiantly wont fall out. I've had the blue tooth discount a couple of times.  Might be because the blue tooth receiver is on the right side.  I moved the phone to my right arm and it's been working pretty good.  My amazon blue tooth for my garage speakers always takes over and kicks the Mpow Swift off my phone.  So I have to leave my house before I connect it.  For the price I think it's a good deal.  But I've only used it twice on 4 mile runs."
"It is very adorable, the only thing is, I have to be careful, or my phone will slip out."
This case is durable and sturdy my friend threw it at the wall.....it left a dent in the wall but the phone and case is perfectly un harmed I love this case
"Music starts cutting out when I put my phone in my pocket. You would think with my phone only being 4 ft away from the earbuds, that this wouldn't be an issue. I will be returning them."
I like the case but the clip is not  as sturdy as they claim. On my first case the clip broke the same day. The clip was replaced and lasted almost a month and it broke again.
"our of memory every single day, even though I have over 8gb in extra free space on the microsd card."
Great cables. Do their job and the right angle connectors are a plus.
"Awesome Case! Fits Well And I Love It, 5 Stars!"
I have had this now for several months.  It arrived on time and has done everything the manufacturer promised it would do.  It has been especially helpful in tracking my sleep patterns so that I can make necessary adjustments.  I love the info it gives me and I feel great!
Excellent
"This is the perfect size for my Samsung Note 4 - It slips into one of the front compartments under the Velcro-fastened front flap.  It's very lightweight but sturdy ripstop nylon material that already sheds water unless it's pouring.  It'll be even better when I spray it with water proofing.  The front slot is a good size for cards such as Driver's license and credit cards.  The zippered compartment is a decent size for a shorter pen, a notebook, coin purse, flash drives, candy, whatever you want  The loop for the belt is double stitched and will accommodate larger belts.  I especially like the extra slot in the belt loop for a carabiner (a small one is in it) and use that most of the time.  It does flop around if I walk fast, but if I put it on a belt, that wouldn't happen.  I received just the right amount of info from the company and it arrived well packaged and earlier than expected.  I've had such a hard time finding anything to carry my Note 4 in that isn't heavy leather and black or brown, this was an especially perfect find.  Mine is a shade more navy than the photo here, but I like that."
Works as advertised. Happy customer here.
Great case for our son's first phone. We're not worried about accidental drops!
Smudge proof. I haven't had a single problem. I can't see scratches either. I'm very pleased with this screen protector.
Worked as it should
This is my 2nd elago case because I like the design and cute colors available.
No problems. Works well and the blue light is cool. Packaging was great.
This cable doesn't charge my iPhone or let me control my music from the car like it's supposed to do.
I love the case but the first time I put it on my phone piece cracked on the side.
Does not work on my iPhone 6
Great phone for the price
The reason I gave it two stars is unlike the original cable it only charge on one side.
Love it and keeping it.
"Great, Great, Great"
no issues
DONT BUY.  VERY POORLY MADE. WORKED WELL AFTER 30 day WINDOW. WEAK. POOR RECEPTION.
Love it
Didnt fit right
Great
It doesn't let my phone receive good signal.
Works great
Love the case! Took a little while to get here - but it was a good price!
Perfecto
Great price.Good case.
My daughter really liked her iPhone case!!!! Perfect fit!!!!
Fits perfect. Fast shipping
worked great great price
Very nice
Bought this for my wife and she loves it! The glitter doesn't come off like other cases and it holds up very nicely.
"Had trouble pairing with Samsung Galaxy because the instructions are misleading. When you hold the power button down as they specify you get a blinking light, but that isn't the pairing mode. You have to hold it down longer until  you get a much brighter flashing red and blue light to enter pairing mode.    Once you get them working you will want to know that you no longer have to hold a cell phone to your ear with one hand, but instead you have to use both hands to hold the ear buds in order to keep them from falling on the floor. Maximum volume is barely sufficient and the quality is just ok for phone but volume and quality not very good for music, and besides who can listen to music having to keep spitting on your ear buds to get them to stay in your ears for at least another 15 seconds?   Truly a piece of garbage."
"Very nice, good quality"
"Works very well, let's see if it lasts."
"Just as cute in person as in the picture, and has protected my phone just fine!"
"When I read some of the other reviews, I was worried that the firmware updates might cause some issues for me.  I bought four of these to control the outside lights on my house, and they have been working great for more than a month now.  I think that Belkin has resolved the firmware issues other reviewers talked about, and I have even had them go through a second update (after the initial one that ran at installation) without any issues.  I have had to restart a few of the switches in order to make them reconnect to my router after I changed some settings, but otherwise they have worked very well.  If you are looking for a solid system to begin connecting you lights to your network, these are a great choice.  The added bonus is they are very easy to set up with Amazon Echo.  I simply logged into my Echo app, and built a group with all of my outside lights.  I can easily turn them on or off as a group from my iPhone or by asking Alexa to take care of it for me.  Definitely a step into the future!"
it protects my nexus 6
"This was purchased to provide 'off grid' charging for my iPhone, iPad etc.... and it has been awesome. It can charge cycle my phone 3 or 4 times easily on one main unit charge. It takes care of my iPad too. I have been very impressed with its ability to hold its charge and how long it can efficiently charge my electronics without dying.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it!"
"I love this product. It is so much better than the &#34;film,&#34; products."
I really like this case.  I bought it for my Samsung Galaxy Note 4.  My husband wanted the Otter Box Defender for his phone but I found that to be way to bulky for my needs.  This case meets my expectations.
"I had high expectations for this power bank, considering the price, and so far it's lived up to those expectations 100%. It's every bit as sturdy and tough as the description makes it out to be -- and yes, I've tested its waterproof-ness. I've charged an iPhone 6 twice and an iPad Air 2 once so far and it still shows half charge -- awesome! I'm thinking I'll be able to charge the iPhone at least 4 more times before actually having to charge this power bank.<br /><br />As for size -- it's definitely on the hefty side (length, width, and weight). But, you're not buying this to slide in your pocket -- you're buying it to keep you going in the great outdoors where anything is possible.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is one that rings true for almost all these power banks -- only one port is 2.1A for fast charging and the other is 1.5A, which is fairly slow for the larger capacity batteries on the new Galaxy phones, Sony phones, and any tablet. Other than that, which isn't a huge deal, I have zero complaints. I'm giving it 5 stars and would recommend it for preppers, hikers, backpackers, campers, and anybody else who loves to spend life outside.<br /><br />** I received this for a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This is my unbiased review. If I thought it was junk, I'd be using this space to tell you to avoid it. **"
Excellent product
"Unlike some other car stereos listed on Amazon, this one actually works, and works reasonably well. Once you get used to the buttons arrangement it's a breeze to operate. I would have preferred a unit wit a remote control but one can't have everything for a reasonable price these days. My only concern is that the unit was made in china and my experience with their goods is that they are largely kraap and have the lasting power of a tissue in a bonfire. We'll see. All of that notwithstanding, the volume is reasonable, the sound adequate, the radio sensitivity marginally acceptable and the ergonomics decent. I give this radio four stars because it didn't smoke out or detonate in 3 nanoseconds."
Exelent
When it states wireless i was expecting something you charge and use to  charge your phone. Still needs a wire
I love this phone great screen and sound quality you can install all the apps you could possibly want with 32gb onboard storage i only wish you could update to lollipop i got this phone to replace my lg g3 that was stolen from me and i must say i am not disappointed.
"Stylish, lightweight with a nice lean to position for horizontal reading."
"Sound great over factory speakers for a Chevy Blazer. Much more bass yet no amp added.<br /><br />6 month update on the Kenwood KFC-1665S 6.5 inch 2 way speakers:<br />We have now been listening to these Kenwood speakers in our Chevrolet Blazer for the past six months. The speakers have gone through extreme temperatures from hot to frigged cold, and I mean frigged as in minus 35 degrees, during these past 6 months. And the speakers have came through like champs. There has been no distortion from the Kenwood speakers that were installed to replace the factory GM paper speakers that came with the truck. We have no noise, crackling or even whine from these Kenwood speakers. The sound is good, rich, crisp and will give you some thump. These are not bass speakers so do not assume you will rock the house down. But they can get plenty loud enough that two people sitting side by side have to scream at the top of the lungs to be heard.<br /><br />This is not our first pair of these Kenwood speakers, as I have purchased them in the past (maybe slightly different model numbers) for some of the other Chevrolet Blazers that we have owned before. I have always came back to these Kenwood speakers as they fit well in the factory opening with no alterations. They are not paper coned so no need for any liquids that might be spilled on them through the door speaker grill. And for the fact they sound so good for such a small price!<br /><br />If you are not trying to build a sound studio in your vehicle, and are just looking for a good upgrade to the cheap factory speakers that are found in most vehicles. I would recommended trying out these Kenwood speakers in your vehicle. You will easily see a difference between the factory speakers to the Kenwood speakers. Even the daughter enjoys them and you know how the young generation likes to turn their music up. We plan on buying more of these to put into our Honda as well. I would easily recommended these Kenwood speakers to friends and family and to anyone who is seeking good, basic sound from a basic quality speaker.<br /><br />We were not paid nor discounted in any way, shape or form for giving our honest opinion here of this product as a review to assist others.

"These are good quality; I like the Bluetooth capability. I like how they can be used wirh music and phone calls.  Sometimes, though, they do fall out of my ears. That causes an inconvenience. I would recommend these for use."
Yeah it broke so this sucks
I have this stuck to my vans console and it is nearly vertical. My phone sticks to it with no problem.
"I was really excited about these when they arrived! They are very long. Right off the bat one didn't work, but I was so happy with the other two, I didn't complain. Shortly after I started using them another quit working, followed by the third. Don't waste your money on these!"
"Fit my Note5 perfectly. Craftsmanship of case is on part with cases from Incipio, Belkin, and other name brand."
I love this case!  It fits perfectly and it looks great!
"Absolutely the best bang for buck ive ever had, they were my answer when i used to have kicker vr's then i had kenwood and boss and sundown sa 8's and none compare to qpower, when i first  saw them i was like the extra surround couldnt possibly do anything good but my god does it hit hard and hit low, i currently have one 15 and two tens in my car all qpower, and its the best combo ever!!!! Btw the pic is when i put them in my boxes in my room before they were put into my car."
"This case is great, easy to get things in and stays put.  I was surprised I could get as many cards, at least 4.  A must have if you need to carry license, cc, room key, and some cash."
"I have updated my review for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.  The foam pads were impossible to re-apply, and the side pieces don't create enough grip to hold an iPhone 6s plus.<br /><br />2.  The bottom feet do not stay in place, and as they're the primary load-bearer, it's no longer a good unit for me to have.  I got my year's worth out of it, and if you're okay with buying a new one every year, that's cool.<br /><br />##### Original review follows #####<br /><br />I'm very happy with the unit so far. I previously used a dash-mount unit from MPOW, and I was very happy with it until an Alabama summer made short work of the glue holding the foam pads in place. This unit uses the same design, which is why this gets just four stars. I'm ready to use a stronger adhesive when the time comes.<br /><br />For value, this mount is hard to beat! Having the phone much closer is very, very nice."
"Works well, had no problems setting up."
They stopped working the first day I got them even after I charged them they still wouldn't work
"Started to come apart, separate shortly after putting on phone. silicone sides was coming apart from clear backing"
"This is a Great cell phone holder. first the most impressive. it actually HOLDS on to a textured dash. if you move it often all it takes is a little water to clean it and make it stick again. it has so few moving parts no gears or flimsy plastic pieces that eventually break with repeated use. it is slightly awkward to put a phone in one handed but can be done with a little practice. one con, its so short that if you keep your phone vertical and not near the edge of your dash getting a power cord in. well worth it."
"arrived quickly, great device"
Great fit. Best case for g stylo on the market:) if you use your phone very often ( for work) this is the right case for you;) it doesn't make your phone bulky and it fits perfect
Works great for my mom's phone.
Everybody thinks it is a book! I love how solid it is around my Surface Pro. I also like how it hides the fact that I am caring a computer.
Already broken in same place as the other 2 i have had awful product
Charges the phone but doesn't transfer music
"Simple, feels good in hand and made up of good quality"
Thanks!
Screen is good! As advertised
"First off Not 3 way,its 2 way but i knew that after i read all the reviews before i purchased these so im not complaining at all....Shipped really fast, hooked up and fit perfect in my 93 chevy blazer, and it sounds really good!"
Very good
Nice case feels good it's just that the magnet will make the gps go crazy.
"This was a great 1st time purchase experience with Amazon. this is an awesome product, from the price to the shipping time."
Very pleased with this item!
Great product and fairly simple to put together. Looks good but be ready to purchase another cable since its pretty much there once you set it up! Highly recommended if ill end up being a charging station in your desk or something!
"Quality and super fast shipping. Product is plain black which is fine with me figured I could decorate it my own way then. Very good quality with a nice fit, doesn't slip around at all. A little bulky but not bad at all and you will get that with any phone cover. I am so pleased with my order. Definitely would order from this company again without hesitation."
poor fit compared to the schoche. Makes the head unit sit too far back
Product deliverey was excellent and case is a excellent fit. Its been 1 days but no complaints. Thanks for great service!😄
Soooooo Cute
I have never been so impressed with a smartphone then the new moto G third generation it is light years ahead of the HTC One mini that it replaced. Great camera great battery life very fast and fluid no bloatware front carrier will never own another smartphone then a Motorola best smartphone for the money by far.
Love it is. Very easy to use.
Works very well with decent range.
"► Pros:<br />✓ 20,000 mAh, thats a lot of charging between devices<br />✓ The big daddy of the portable charger world, holding about 2-3 times more charge<br />✓ Dual charging ports, so you can keep two devices charged up<br />✓ Battery life indication, so you know how soon till you need to give it a charge or how long you can keep charging your own device(s)<br />✓ Has more mAh than my old laptop battery!<br />✓ They didnt add a useless flashlight into it.<br /><br />► Cons:<br />⊗ It's a tad long<br /><br />► Conclusions and final thoughts:<br />For this amount of mAh (this is the amp hours your device will last, more is better) it has to be long, tall, or wide. If you don't wear skinny jeans you can drop this into any of your pockets, even the side leg pocket for carpenter pants (think thats designed for the handle of a hammer). We only have two cellphones in the house and from max charge (owned this for about 10 days), i havent been able to kill the battery. So, it's done its job, more over than any other portable charger i've owned to date.<br />If you have a power hungry device, going on a trip, this might be the single go to device you should get."
Great screen protector
Good product but the paint seems to ware off with time. For the price its still worth it.
"Love the battery pack. Anker is absolutely one of the best. It does not come with a charger itself, so you have to use the charged supplied with your phone or tablet. It also didn't come with a cable/adapter to fit the charger I have. Aside from that...no comlaints, just wish it came with these needed accessories."
"Great looking ,durable case. I bought one for myself then a second for my daughter after really liking mine.<br />Fast service.<br />Would do business with them again."
"Finally got to use this on our family beach vacation and it was PERFECT! It struck the interest of both my mom and my aunt (who live near beaches), it worked so well I'm going to buy them each one as a gift :-)"
It's simple enough and works .
This is a fantastic charger. We used it on a family camping trip to recharge several iPhones and it was amazing.
This is a great product. Easy to use and I love that it repels water.
Real handy to charge multiple phones when travelling as a family. Functional and appealing design
Did exactly what it said it would. Note 4 charges under &#34;fast charging&#34;. Loved this product. Got it for $8 too with special code.
"1 inlet port and 2 outlet ports keep this 11200mAh Portable Charger External Battery Power Bank simple and easy to use. Included in the package is a USB charging cord. This device has 2 ports to charge your phone, tablet, or other devices. 1 Port is rated at 1 amp and the second port is rated at 2 amps of charging capacity. This Charge Pack has a lot of muscle when you need it most. Fully charged this power bank should charge a iPhone 6 four to five times. Priced right and simple to use, get one today and stay connected.<br /><br />Disclaimer: this item was purchased at a discounted price for reviewing purposes."
Exactly what I needed.
"We bought the protector for Iphone 6 plus. The screen still broke, even though the protector was on it, so its hardly of any use. I would not recommend this product.."
"* I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. *<br /><br />I've had several different versions of backup chargers, but unfortunately I often forget to recharge them after use, so without a power source (which of course would illiminate the need for the backup in the first place) they become temporarily useless. I love the idea of this solar powered power bank. I camp a lot and I think this would be perfect for keeping my phone charged in case of emergency. I also like the idea of keeping it in my car. In order to charge the unit for the first time, I actually left they unit on my dashboard for an afternoon while I was driving around doing errands. At about 75% full according to the LED lights, I hooked up my phone (a Samsung Galaxy s5) and it charged easily and pretty quick. I did check a couple of notifications while it was charging the phone, but it still gave me about 20% additional charge. Not ideal testing circumstances, but still plenty to buy me some time with, or I imagine in an emergency, it would allow for at least a phone call or a few. Of course, I also like the environmental aspect of having a solar charger, I hope that the technology continues to improve so more products like this become more widely available. The carabiner that came with it for attaching to a bag or for hanging is a great idea, but I found the one included was too small to fit or hang well on the actual unit. It also doesn't feel very strong, so I'd be afraid it might bend or break. I plan to add my own larger one so that I can keep this clipped or otherwise easily accessible. Great idea, and an easy to use alternative option to standard back up chargers."
"DO NOT BUY.<br />I'll try to be short.<br />Was biking, had phone and key in arm band.<br />Velcro is terrible, comes loose while biking.<br />Key falls somewhere in the woods.<br />Samsung falls and front facing camera breaks.<br />Think about all of the injustices in the world.<br /><br />IXCC, IF YOU GO BANKRUPT AND NEVER SELL ANYTHING AGAIN IT WON'T BE ENOUGH TO PAY ME FOR THIS INJUSTICE."
"Love this cable! Durable, no tangles, just the right size. Couldn't ask for anything more!"
Works great
"This product went beyond my expectations. I don't leave reviews but when I got an e-mail requesting to do so, I jumped right on it. You won't be disappointed by investing in this case."
GOOD.
"I like this item well enough. For the price it is decent, but it's not the most sturdy thing ever. It's a really flexible plastic. At least it doesn't add extra &#34;bulk&#34; to my phone though!"
Arrived in 2 days I was so excited and this case is perfect! The camo on the back is so smooth and doesn't peal off worth the 8 bucks!! Would definatly recommend and would buy again!!
"The wall charger advertises a capacity of 600mAh. I thought this would be great for giving my smartphone a small boost after the wall charger is unplugged. However, there is no 600mAh inside the charger - it is just a plain wall charger with no capacity reserve. Disappointing and not as described."
"If you follow directions, it's quite easy to install.  Very clear, and works great!"
This case has already saved my poor phone from what could have been several catastrophes. I am very pleased with this product.
Looks Great and works like it is suppose too. Great value for the price!
These cases are awesome...
"HANDS DOWN, BEST CELLPHONE CASE I HAVE EVER BOOT. Thanks!"
This product came in on time and was exactly what I was expecting
"i bought this because i travel alot by car and i use waze,this i bought it for my brother"
"Awesome. Recharges my phone 4 or 5 times, my tablet almost 3 times and fits in my purse"
Awesome Product! I never write reviews but I love this screen protector. It was super easy to place on my iPhone! It's the first time I didn't get dust or bubbles under my screen! Highly recommend this product.
i purchased this unit through another site it did not do well at all i hooked it up to 3-160 watt solar panels for a total of 480 watts theyre wired in parallel at first it put out about 150 watts in full sun i got that reading using my killawatt meter about 2 minutes later it tripped my GFI plug but continued to show wattage on the killawatt meter meaning it was still running so the anti island feature was not working i had already pulled the plug so it should have turned off but it did not finally a few seconds later it went up in smoke it was throwing lots of smoke out of the vents. i do have another brand of inverter that ive been running for several months without issues so I'm just not sure on the quality of this brand.
Item has a weird black border and is not very appealing
Excellent product
"I own both sizes but didn't buy on amazon, due to they were not carried at the time.  I just bought my 12 oz.  I can say from using these since December, I couldn't be happier.  I take it on the boat in Ga summer,  the stainless steel is hot to touch on outside of cup but I have ice and my tea isn't watered down.<br />My husband sits my coffee next to my bed around 5am.  When I get up at 7 or 8 I still have hot coffee.<br />Also he will fix my 16 oz with tea and sit next to my bed in morning's and I drink it most of the day.  At night a cup is fixed for me snd in the morning I still have a drink thats not watered down. My coke doesn't get watered down quick either.<br />Yes, these do keep your coffee Hot but don't expect.it to be streaming hot in 4 hour's.  But I will say. It will keep your ice (there will be some melting its not a freezer) to 24 hours depending on where your using it at.  No problem with leaking in any of them.<br />Do not have the stainless steel taste,  I have another bubba that is stainless steel.  Do not like that one and took it back.<br />This has to be a good product for me to write this long of a review.<br /><br />Too bad Amazon doesn't have a seller on here that sells them for reasonable prices 19.99 and down, which us what I've paid at other stores"
Good item
Nice. My granddaughter like it. I received it sooner than expected. Thank you so much.
Great item
"will not work on my ipad air. Did not know Apple put a chip in so you would have to buy their product, am very disappointed cause I need a longer cable. I wish you had added iphone etc on page when I ordered."
"Image is sturdy, buy it hold dirt."
GOOD.
its great
So far so good. It works great and hasn't conked out like other car chargers I have purchased in the past
Great case!!
Excellent. Still works years later
"I purchased his case for my 11 year daughter. She tends to be a bit rough with her electronics so this case was perfect for her. It's quite sturdy however, it came with a clip back to it and the phone in the case doesn't even fit in it. I'm not sure if it was randomly thrown into my order or not but it's rather useless-hence the 4 star."
Nice product.... Works well
Awesome case!!
"Functions perfectly, although sometimes hearing it becomes difficult becuase the sound is not clear enough it should have more volume"
"Obviously being Samsung original equipment, the fit is excellent. The front cover with the see-thru panel is nice. But that's where the good things end. Although this is an obvious flaw, you obviously can't take pictures or video by just flipping the front cover all the way around since there is no hole for the lens to protrude through. So the front cover just kind of swings awkwardly while you film. Second, it's Fingerprint City. I think most can tolerate this on the back, but with this cover, even the front panel gets covered with them in a matter of minutes. Kind of unsightly. But by far the most horrific problem is the fact that there is no latch magnetic or otherwise that keeps the front cover closed in place. Not only is this awkward and irritating when you are handling it, were it to fall, the cover would simply fly open on the way down, so it really provides very little protection other than maybe from getting scratched in your pocket. Cool concept, terrible execution. It's being returned immediately."
Not too shabby.
"I received this product at a discount for my honest review.<br /><br />It's always a good idea to have an external charger handy when you're out and about and on the go. And believe me when I say, I am almost always out and about and on the go! I decided to give this portable charger a go.<br /><br />They describe the charger as:<br /><br />-ULTRA-HIGH CAPACITY 15000 mAh - No more hugging walls break free from the outlet! Tech Tribe's external charger offers enough power to charge an iPhone 6 (7 x`s), iPhone 6 plus (5 x`s), iPad Air (1.5`s)<br />-DUAL USB PORTS - 5v 1 amp & 5v 2.1 amp You can charge your smart phone and tablet at the same time or charge 2 smart phones. Very convenient when you are on the go. Never let your devices run out of juice again. You can even charge PSP, iPod, Kindle or any other device that is charged with a USB cable.<br />-AIRCRAFT GRADE ALUMINUM - If lightweight and portable weren't enough this top of the line charger is also ultra-durable. The case is made out of heavy duty aircraft grade aluminum for added strength and durability. Also it will not overheat like many chargers with plastic cases.<br />-LIFETIME WARRANTY - Make this the last charger you ever buy. If for any reason your Tech Tribe Razor is found faulty you qualify for a replacement under our warranty. We only require you to register the product within your first 30 days of purchase and you are covered for life.<br />-WHY SHOULD YOU BUY OUR CHARGER - Lets face it when you search amazon for a high capacity charger you will find many big brand names with great offerings. However, when we compared the competition we realized the quality for most of the chargers was very low, including the use of plastic cases in order to save on production cost. The plastic typically gets hot while you are charging your device. Also the internal components on most power banks were put together very crudely. We saw the opportunity and would like to introduce Tech Tribe Smart Boost, a high quality charger with aluminium casing and sleek design. Overall a great value!<br /><br />I have both Apple and Android products so having a device that charges both is necessary. The Tech Tribe handles all devices flawlessly and recharged them in good time. It did not overheat, which I find many devices do.<br /><br />The only downfalls to this charger are you have to carry the charging cords of your devices with you, the Apple ones especially. And they say it is lightweight but I found it to be a little on the heavy side.<br /><br />The long and short of it is it works just like they say it will. Don't go without power ever again! Pick up this external charger and your worries will end."
"I love this case. It has all the protection for my cell that the ad said it would. I dropped it on a cement floor three days ago and it still works perfectly. When I throw the case in my purse, I use the screen cover/belt clip to protect the screen and that's great, too. Buy it, you'll love it!"
The item works fine but is a little bulkier than I expected.
Install was straight forward and worked well out of the box.  Many good videos on YouTube
"Great lil' speaker. Sound is really good for the size and price. Works great on my back deck when streaming music thru my phone. No issues as of yet with the Bluetooth connectivity not working and it synced up in a snap. Actually like the fact the volume is controlled only by the phone, and it is plenty loud enough. Great product so far."
I wish i would have read the reviews before buying.  Signal strength is reduced significantly. I cannot return it since I drilled out the bottom so that i could fit a headphone jack.
Sturdy case.  My husband loves it.
"Works as advertised, though I'm afraid that it might break the vent louvers unless I'm careful."
I bought two of these chargers and both craped out in less than 2 months. why is it so hard to get good chargers? I a waiting  for an authorization to return them. I want a full refund at this point
it works very well
"I do own a few car charges; some I enjoy better than others but for the most part, they have done their jobs with no problems. I opted in for this 4 Port USB Car Charger by Celltronix because I own another one of their products and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />This 4 Port Charger arrived packaged well without any damages visible. It looked exactly as the advertised pictures so there were no unexpected surprises on my end.<br /><br />So what gives this 4 Port USB Car Charger a different look is the way the USB connection ports are placed!! Instead of a really long and bulky looking charger, the 4 ports are placed on both sides of the head. So I no longer have to worry about charger cords protruding from the top. That was an instant plus for me!<br /><br />I took this 4 Port USB Charger right away to my car and put it in use. The power indicator light showed up instantly when I turned the car on. Before I connected my iPhone and iPad, I connected my charger cables to be sure the product would not get hot during use. My results were negative so I proceeded to connect my iPhone and iPad with instant charging success.<br /><br />Overall as of now, I have had no problems with this device and I have no complaints. I think it is well designed and made. I really am looking forward to long-term use from it.<br /><br />I was selected to review this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
"I own several items by Cyverlandtron and they have all been great. So when I had the opportunity to test their dual (2.1 amps & 1 amps) port USB car adapter at a discount for my review I jumped on the opportunity. This adapter is made of plastic but are very well built and strong. I dropped mine on the concrete driveway and it did not break. They are also nice and small in size so it does not take but to much extra room.<br /><br />I tested the car adapters against my house charger to see how fast these thing really were. To my surprise the estimate charge time my phone (Samsung Galaxy 6) gave me was within a minute of the house hold charger that came with the phone. When I plugged a second phone in (iPhone 6) the estimated charge time only dropped by 1 minute. So the quick answer is these car adapters are just as good as charging in the house with the chargers that came with the phones. I like that they have a blue light that lets you know when they are plugged in and charging.<br /><br />Quick pros:<br />Fast charging times<br />Charge 2 devices at once<br />Blue light to let you know it is working<br />Strong, well built<br />Small in size<br />Will charge apple products<br /><br />I Recommend this car adapters."
"I used a few sticks before but there were always technical problems after a short time of using. I was sceptical during ordering this one but after one week of intensive using I am really satisfied. Good material, great connectivity with my iPhone 5s and those amazing tips in eBook? If you are planning to get a selfie stick I really recommend this one."
It fits perfectly and protects my phone while making it easy to access.
"This product is a must, it definitely protects your phone and great customer service!"
"For me it's the best camera ever, it allows me to capture every moment while having a good time."
This product doesn't work!! Don't waiste your money. They do not want to give me a refund. I asked for my money back two times.
"i received this product free for review and it works great. i love that i can still see my screen on teh front, but the back is still protected by this case! it was easy to put on and fits perfectly."
"I just purchased this item and it is already cracked. Prior to purchasing this, I read the reviews and wished the company was making a better product than other customers had stated. Believe it or not, those comments about a cheaply made product is correct. I dropped the case and the top portion completely came off and cracked. Fortunately, I have a shatter proof screen protector and me $900 iPhone wasn't damaged."
"[[VIDEOID:4a3c457c525011e8a0c9f3ed4929278]]I am extremely hard on my Iphone. If it's not being dropped on the ground it's being sat on! I am forever dropping my phone, always trying to carry to many things at once and my phone gets the grunt of it. So I NEED a good protective case ALL THE TIME. When this came up for review- yup- I wanted in. It arrived and I so loved my color choice. It comes in so many color choices that there's a perfect color choice for everyone. But the Lime Green and Grey is the BEST in my humble opinion. The case has multiple layers, a plastic protective screen cover, a silicone cover and a hard case. The combination of the three makes this a really durable case. I originally thought it would be bulky but I was proven wrong. It's nice and sleek. My wireless wasn't interfered with either and the case has what I call a kick stand. I can prop up my phone to watch movies or videos.  Talk about convenience! Overall I honestly like this case. I did drop my phone- Shock right? It bounced. My phone is still working just fine waiting to take all the future abuse poor lil `ole me can give it.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  #TQR"
"It's exactly what I need: Durable, sleek, and awesome to look at!"
"I have had it for a while now and couldn't love it more it hits great, gets deep, and has great build quality i don't care if it's built in China or not it is build better than my American made car"
Works great!  Such a great deal for the price!!
"Its working great so far its been a little over a month. few things i dont like are its too bulky, the phone gets EXTREMELY hot when charging, you cant charge with a normal iphone charger. but those are honestly all pretty minor issues the case works great, they raised the price recently which was upsetting i was gonna order another one but not anymore."
"The band looks good, but cannot be adjusted small enough for my wrist. I have an average women's size wrist for 5&#34;4&#34; and 125#"
Return item
"The screen cover was very well-packaged, had all the items in the box needed to do a good job, had clear instructions, was simple and easy to install, and so far is working very well."
Great product.  Handsome looking pens and handy for tablets.
love it
This is the best case I have ever had on my IPhone 6+.  It is good quality and durable. I love it
"I love the case, I think I made the right choice"
I love this!
Decent holder.  Easy to use.
chinese crap
"These are exactly the same as they are described, my only complaint is the little rubber tips. Don't seem to last long before they go flat. Atleast you do get 9 of them! Lol"
"sync, charge, do what ever the apple cable do with better quality and durability."
"Great case. I use it with a glass laminate to protect the touchscreen.  Love the orange color, makes it easy to find. I'm planning to order a spare for the time when this case gets worn out."
Charges my phone multiple times.
Great Product!<br />It holds my phone in place and it does not slip off or anything.<br />Definitely recommend.
Very satisfied with this purchase.
"Great product, and shipping by Amazon.  Currently charging the following with no issues:  Android phone, Android Tablet, Iphone 5, Ipad Air, Ipad Air2.  Works great, and the blue backlight are a plus at night, but mostly covered once you plug your cable into the usb jack."
Works as advertised.  No Issues.
"Very sturdy case, I got this for my son because he is always dropping his phone and of course it breaks but I have a feeling he wont break it again with this rugged case!! It fits his phone perfectly too."
i really liked it<br />but on the second day it broke<br />but i could still fix it so its ok
The unit does get very warm after a full charge.
Thank you!
Great product
"It was a terrible, cheaply made case. The fingerprint scan does not work. It's to bulky for the I phone 6 plus. You have to take out 12 screws to get the phone in or out. The protective cover over the home button is paper thin. Lasted about 10 minuets. I could go on more but I think you get the point. Absolutely the worst &#34;waterproof&#34; case ever made."
"The qi charger on this device is surprisingly quick. I use this for my note 5 before i head out to class and work. I use the qi charger when i have over 30 percent battery left because its much better for your battery life, not over charging it like you would when charging it directly. When you charge your phone using qi, the charging output drops when your phone reaches a certain percent. My phone charges from 50 percent to 100 in about 30 mins. Not a bad device at all. You could get about two to three full charge with it."
This case broke in less than a week. The only reason for giving it two stars was the team design on back was pretty cool.
works very very well !! love it !
Great speakers.
"Charger worked well while it lasted, after about a month of use it stops working and iPhone 6+ says the wire is not compatible with phone for charging..."
Came when it said it would. Inexpensive. Good product.
Fits as it should
This is by FAR the best charger i have ever purchased. it feels and is very sturdy. and i love how fast it charges my iphone. 5 Stars no doubt.
Its light and fits perfectly.
5 stars
I love it! No complaints here!
This was a gift. My husband says it charges his iPad very quickly.
"We used this on a road trip, worked great."
The &#34;rubberized coating&#34; peeled off within a week and I was left with a white case were the two interlocking pieces began unlocking and falling apart within 2 weeks. Not even worth the 2 dollars I spent.
Returning!<br />The cover causes a halo affect when you are using the self facing camera.
Great smart watch! Own the original Pebble and this is definitely a step forward! You won't be disappointed!
The case started cracking after only 2 weeks. It's cute but won't last.
Good. Very compact nd atttrctive.
"I purchased this for my wife's Galaxy Note 4. She wanted it to fit well (not too tight or too loose), and provide some protection from minor drops. The most important attribute that she was looking for was for the case to not add too much bulk to the phone. It's perfect, and the buttons are responsive with the case on. Well worth the few bucks. I was so impressed with it, that now I purchased the Galaxy Note 5 version for my phone."
Work well
This phone has lasted me for over a year and has maintained it's speed and responsiveness.  It even got the lollipop upgrade after which everything worked perfect.<br /><br />The battery life is fantastic and hasn't gone down much over my year of ownership.<br /><br />Iv'e dropped it a number of times and it only got a couple minor scrapes and scratches.  The screen is still perfect and great for reading articles and responding to emails.
Ordered this case for my husband and he absolutely loves it. It is very durable and fits his phone perfectly. Would definitely recommend this phone case to anyone;
The kickstand doesn't  work properly as offered.<br />The edges of the cover don't  let manipulate the edges app.
"Until ANdroid can treat SD storage in a much more integrated way, the phone has a huge issue with being full all the time. Other than that a perfect budget phone. Just don't download any apps!"
I love this case!
"The speaker is a little bit on the tinny side, but for the size and price of the radio one can't complain.  A couple of things I don't like about it is the default setting.  I bought it for the radio, and I have to hit the FM button after turning it on in order to get the radio to come on, and at this point often get blasted by sound or have to turn the volume up.  The volume control is too sensitive.  But all in all it does a great job."
"If you are debating, then just buy it. I have been using this for the past half year, it is so convenient to have this, and I hardly miss any messages with this sitting next to my ear."
Really enjoying my new case.
Fits great
i have to return this
"Bought it for my high school age student, he loves it."
Works great and that's what matters
"Was really happy with this case - very slim, unobtrusive, and I police the yellow color, but the it broke literally the next day. The thin piece of plastic between the volume controls and the screen snapped overnight. Pretty disappointing. I hadn't expected a cheap case to last too long, but at least 48 hours?"
Product as expected.
"Does the job, i.e. good protection, while remaining light and very thin. I just wish the material would let the color of the phone pass through some more."
"I bought this for my father as he is always leaving his phone places and losing it. He loves that it clips right on his belt and he can always find his phone when he needs it. I purchased the same one for his old phone, and it seemed to slide out of the holster a lot easier than this one does. This one tends to get stuck/take some muscle to slide it out. Also, the kickstand is not easy to pop out, especially for a man who does not have fingernails to dig in and pull it out. It is sturdy and functional, however."
It broke when I put it in and wouldn't let me put my phone case on
"They are really comfortable for running and the shape does give it more strength over the ear so it does work great for sports. The only thing Im not so sure about, is the shape of the earphone it self. It feels funny and doesnt really sit tightly inside my ears as I hope it would. This makes the sound kind of strange every once in a while, but you get used to it."
Love it color AWESOME  :) :) :)
"Love these cases. Had them for my s3, s5, and now iPhone 6. Very good price for a high quality case that's easy to grip and keeps my phone safe."
It worked great while I had it I recently upgraded to a different phone
"When this is fully charge, it will give about 2 full charges to my iPhone 5s. I had this abroad in Europe with me and was so helpful when travelling. Fully recommend for those travelling!"
Its easy to carry my phone and money at the same time
"Yes, it did meet my expectations."
This is such a great case! I expected a LOT less. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality case for a low price. I definitely know I got my money's worth.
"I liked everything about his product....the case, the color are all on point, but I noticed it did crack after I dropped it on the carpet.  Be careful..."
Very good quality!
Works great!
I was very pleased with the products and the fast delivery speed.
I bought these 2 pack a couple of months ago. When I received it only 1 was working good. Anker customer service being as Great as they are reimbursed me half for the inconvenience.<br /><br />I say it is a good product all around (compared to others on the market) Tho not the best.<br /><br />The 1 product is still working good no complaints. I would recommend this to others for the price.<br /><br />My rating is as follows:<br />5 stars for Anker customer service.<br />3 stars for the (1 working product I received)<br /><br />For an overall rating of 4 stars!!!
"Great fit, just like all the paat Spigen products I've ordered. This case has been protecting my phone for over four months now and haven't had any issues. I do construction so the phone has been put through a lot. Drops, falls, being stepped on and dust. Thus cast has protected it perfectly. Cannot go wrong with Spigen if you're looking for a less bulky case than Otter Box."
"Can't beat the price, but this product broke within three days of purchase. But I don't feel bad since the price was cheap."
When you put the battery in the back will not close and so it wont stay on. Im returning this product as it does not meet the requirements it offers.
I was excited when I received it but after a few days and my little girl grabbed and dropped it the case chipped on the side. I thought it was durable. I am disappointed.
These are a life saver. I've seen so many friends with cracked screens. I've not had a problem with this strong tempered glass protection. It's just like using the iPhone straight from the box.
Came as promised.  This replaces one that I've had for a couple years.  Really like the UP app with its Smart Coach!
I have usd this cover until it broke. I have told many of my friends about the best place to find a case for your phone.
"Pros:<br />-These work great for Quick Charge compliant chargers.<br />-Higher quality than most cheap USB cables. Sturdy. Faster charging from thicker gauge wire.<br />-Inexpensive<br /><br />Cons:<br />-None<br /><br />I have replaced all of my old cables with Aukey, Anker, and Tronsmart cables (same OEM) because they work so much better and last longer."
I think i received the wrong item ... it looks the same except the one i got does not have then sensitivity adjustments in fact there are no holes there at all  and one end had female RCA cables the other side had male cables  i thought this one had speaker wiring on one side and RC on other also  my subs sound like s*** ... they have decent bass and are 500w each but you cant really feel it in your chest  i am using this to hook up an amp to a stock head unit for my subs
perfect fit for replacing my old motorized factory antenna in the old 94 accord.
Love my otterbox commuter series case!!!!
Was very cheap and didn't look like the picture. Was literally a patterned sticker on a white plastic case.
"Love the feel, the look, and the protection.  I definitely recommend this product for iphone users."
My favorite case!  This case has endured hundreds of drops on concrete and tile with no damage.  My only issue is that the blue started to look dirty after awhile and I couldn't get the stains out.  I bought this same in case in grey so finger prints were not as noticeable.
"****READ THIS***** The latest android update has caused a lot of the apps previously used to connect your watch to your phone unusable. I was FINALLY able to get this watch to work in full capacity after downloading an app called (SmartWear) in the google play store. The current icon used looks like a black square with a white border and thin blue line representing the hands of a clock. Yes I have the latest version of Android as of 9-2-2015 and this is the only app that has worked for me afeter trying like 7 apps before.  (Make sure to do the following instructions immediately back to back. If one disconnects while the other is connecting go back and try to reconnect meaning if the bluetooth fails to connect while Smartwear is attemptingto connect go back to the bluetooth and attempt to pair again keeping both programs attempting to connect simultaneously.  It may take a few tries more or less but it will eventually connect fully.  To connect the watch using SmartWear app: run the app asking it to search for the watch (WHILE ITS SEARCHING/connecting), then go into the bluetooth settings ON YOUR PHONE then do a scan. You should see the option (Smart Watch) choose it. Once connected go into your phones setting for that connection and choose to connect the call audio and media audio. Once these options are selected my phone allows the SmartWear app to fully connect to my watch.  I will do my best to respond to any comments. Good luck!!"
"I'm pleased with this phone case. I was using a Pelican case that I bought at ATT when I got my phone. This one feels high quality. It does not have a rubber or silicone band or outer casing, which gives it a sleeker design. It also feels lighter than my other case, but I don't think we sacrificed protection. I have dropped my phone with this case on, without issues.I only give 4 stars instead of 5 because the case makes the buttons a little hard to push. I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for a review, but the words are my own."
I love the dictionary cover! It protects my phone. The credit card slots and pocket works well with what I need.
"The macro lens got stuck after putting it into the clip for the first time, making the Fish Eye lens unusable. I tried everything to get that lens out but it wouldn't budge. The threading must've been off or something."
Received as promotion. I'm a bit disappointed because one review stated that iPhone 6 plus would fit with otter box on. It will go in but not easily and I don't intend on removing my case everyday to place in holder. If it were a half inch longer it would be perfect. Those of you without otter box will probably love the fit. Once I got the armband secure on my arm it was comfortable but it took some time to get the strap through the double slots and fastened; or maybe I don't have enough coordination. I used it during my workout and the band served its purpose so I will probably get some use out of it and may get used to strap difficulty over time. I will likely get more use out of this during power walks for the music and not use it during bootcamp.
it is not harnes cable
"okay so i got this for my home made sound system for my house and i used this to replace a cheap sony sub and wow i also have 2 12s and this little 10 sounds better honestly, its more punchy and solid, i love it! when my 2 12s blow i'm getting the same type of speaker to match and have a way better sound system then anything i could hope for"
"I didn't like it at all. Worst of all, i cant return it."
Worst chip!
Cracked within 2 weeks
Terrible! Phone will not even turn on properly. It really is a hit or miss when it comes to these discounted batteries. I wish I had tried installing sooner before I lost the window to return.<br /><br />The NY Sticker was no where to be found at all.<br /><br />Hopefully the attached link could give you some insight on the battery you receive &#34;see cycle count&#34;. I wish I had not waited so long and very disappointed in this product.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOOZZeTTR1o
"Went on easy, fits pretty well and I love the color. Has some exta cutouts but they don't bother. Ok for the price."
It worked great for 4 months but usb connector on unit broke.  When I asked to return.  No reply.
Just as described.
"Very heavy, nice pen, I like the laser pointer, the actual pen is not very high quality but looks nicer than a plastic pen without the high price. Perfect for business"
fits true but can't use any other case on the top of it.
This is a very colorful case that snaps easily onto your phone. The design is cute although the colors on the actual cover are not as vibrant as the image posted. It has a nice tactile finish. All the openings are perfectly accessible but I'm not sure how much protection this cover will really offer so it's really just for aesthetics. I received it for free from the manufacturer in return for a review but all of the opinions expressed are my own.
Good quality case. Took a little longer to get here than I liked but it was inexpensive but good quality
Perfect
"Good headset for the price, but have had a couple of issues. It was initially easy to pair with my iPhone but have had the pairing fail several times for no apparent reason. I am just using it for my phone, primarily while driving, and had to switch to speakerphone when it happened in order to take the incoming call. Very distracting, so I had to pull over. The other issue is I find it painful to have on my ear after a while. My ear is on the small side, so that could be contributing to the problem. My old Headset sat on the outside of my ear and didn't have to be inserted into the ear like this one, so it was very comfortable. It cost twice as much, however, and broke right after the warranty expired, so I replaced it with this one. I am hoping that I will find a more comfortable way to wear it."
"This Galaxy Note 5 case by i-Blason is great.  It is heavy duty, rugged, and durable.  It comes with a belt clip/holster that is secure and swivels.  The black color is perfect for guys like me.  It is very easy to put the phone in the case and it fits like a glove.  I have had it on since it came to me and I even put the screen protector on after I put this case on.  The ports for charging and headpphones are easy to access as is the S-pen.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review."
This is a great case with a kick stand. And alot cheaper then at the phone stores or the mall.
"To be honest, at first blush I wasn't overly excited about this charger. Four ports with a maximum output of 5 amps (aggregate) is no big deal in an AC charger these days. Many newer Android devices (all of the higher end models) and many, if not most larger tablets ship with 2 amp chargers. That being the case, if you have four higher draw devices that you want to charge at one time, then this is not the charger you need. However, this will charge 3 high end Android phones (any I've ever tried draw a maximum of 1.65 amps) or it will charge four any model iPhones, or a combination of Droids and iPhones as long as the total amperage draw doesn't exceed 5 amps. The smart charging feature means that the charger will automatically detect the optimum charging amperage of each device and deliver no more or less to the device.<br /><br />Using a [[ASIN:B00KFS4Y1I USB Power Load Inducer and Tester]], I tested each of the ports and was able to maintain a 2.4 amp load on each port. I then left the load inducer on one port set at 2 amps while plugging in a Galaxy Note 3 and S5, both of which I know from experience to draw 1.65 amps when charging. I allowed this test to run for fifteen minutes and encountered no issues with the charger.<br /><br />To conclude, at the current price of $16.99 (at time of review) and Prime shipping, this is a decent buy. I reiterate that this charger will not fit everyone's needs, so make sure it will fit yours before ordering; but there's a good argument against spending extra money to get more charging capacity then you need.<br /><br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟"
I found to be great to have when walking
Horrible charging looks very nice and was excited....tried it with several plug connectors and they get hot..phone does not charge//I changed the rating to a four star because I tried one more connector and got the charging speed I was expecting (fast)   What really impressed me was the seller called within 24 hours leaving me a voice mail to assist me in resolving my problem .   Will buy from the seller again without delay because of this.. Also I just love the nylon construction. ~
"It falls off 10 times already, I figured it out to stabilized,how? repositioning, tighthen it, sometimes re rotate, my body change, I got sweat and shaken when running. Overall this is the best Armband ever in my experience!! I will recommenr this to my friend, look!! it has LED in it, everytime I look with other joggers and runners, they let their screen on as their lights at night.har har har😃🌃🌌🌃🌌🌃🌌🌃🌌🌃🌌🌃🌌🌃🌃🌃🌌🌃<br />I like the color gray or silver, and green lights! the design is perfect! Congrats! with your attractive product! I do really enjoy it and keeps me exercise more! Atleast one guy ask where I got it😃I am a night guy  because of my work schedule."
Thank you for a great product at an unbeatable price
Beautiful! It's a perfect fit and matches the champagne gold of my phone exactly.
did not work on any smart phone I own..s3 s5 s6 or htc one..refund was simple
Great product
"I was so happy to receive the sample of the Micro USB 2.0, Magic-T 3.3ft/1m Braided A Male to Micro B Sync Charge Cables Cord Tangle-Free with Aluminum Connectors Part for Samsung, HTC, Sony and Other Android Tablets Smartphones [4-Pack] because with all children and all the adult grandchildren that come and go, we are always charging a wide variety of phones and tablets.  These four cords have been in almost constant use charging Kindles, Smartphones and various other tablets.  We like to get everyone together for family dinners and birthday celebrations so this past month we have had at least one gathering each week-end and these cords have been used heavy and performed just fine.  This is my honest experience with these four cords."
It fit perfectly. Feels good in my hand. A little hard to remove but I don't do that often. Slides easily into the pocket in my purse.
excellent product!
It sounds awesome so happy with my speakers
Love this case.  I like it because it helps by protecting the iPhone while also showing off it's cool look.  It also gives a little bit more of a grip so you can hold onto the phone better.  Not too much of a grip but just enough.  Definitely recommend it.  In fact I bought the same case for my work smart phone as well.
Very cheap thin plastic definitely for looks with no protection.
"Great product, I have bought 3 for all vehicles. I have an iPhone 6plus & it holds it great."
Worked perfectly!
I bought 2 over 3 years ago and they are still stuck in the same place.  Never came loose or off.
Easy to use and a firm grip on your phone
"Bought from Vendor &#34;Charger City&#34; and it has been working properly for about a month.<br /><br />Proper fit in the Magellan Roadmate 1700: Not too tight and not too loose.<br /><br />Gets a little warm when operating, but the old one might have done that too."
Great product.  Works great for a great price.
"This case is for my husband's iPhone 6 that has a slim case around it. His phone fits well inside it, and it's easy to get the phone out to answer a call.  The clip is sturdy and securely hooks around his 1 1/2&#34; belt.  He works outside most of the day and moves between different types of equipment, and a flimsy case would not work. We would definitely purchase another one if we needed it.  My husband had a little difficulty with the elastic coming out on one side after about ten months of rough daily use. I contacted Grantwood Technology, and they promptly replaced it. Fantastic customer service!"
Great quality sound and design!
Low price does not excuse low sensitivity with low audio to boot. Cant hold on 2 bars via AT&T . Intermittent audio capture etc.. Only thing worse is the weak response from the supplier. Amazon comes to the rescue...  G. Perry
As Promised
This is one of those products that you never feel too guilty buying because of the price but that being said it didn't last more than a couple of uses and i can't see this being the best option at any point or for any purpose
"Given the price, it should be obvious that these are not going to be the highest quality cords.<br />So far, I've had one die after a couple months of use. Not to the point that it is entirely unusable, but to the point that I have to make sure it is actually charging, or I wake up (like this morning) to a phone that has shut itself off due to the cord not making good contact.<br />Good thing I have 9 more."
"Right after delivery, I opened the product box and found there's some scratches touched up. Also, because the ear speaker sealing is put inside, sticking side can be seen from out side and it's looking bad. maybe because of those, it was quite big discount.<br />However, moreover such cosmetic issue, display response became so bad, it doesn't even my pass code to get in to iphone.<br />I need to press display very firmly but still hard to make it work so that it became too much stressful/annoying using iphone with this case; structure isn't bad but iphone display response became too bad to use. I decided to return this item."
"As an electrical engineer, I am always looking for cool new gadgets to make my life easier.<br /><br />The first thing i noticed about this charger is it is a bit bulkier and heaver than expected. A bit cumbersome for a pocket but doable in an emergency. I think this is better for bags or something like a camping trip rather than carrying it at all times.<br /><br />As far as charging mine worked great with borderline non stop use for about a year and a half. The 2 amp charging port (unlabeled which was annoying) charged my phone fairly fast and allowed me to use my phone for literally days longer than normal. If you are not in a hurry or need to charge multiple devices, the other socket also worked well but over time would not charge my phone while I was on it but rather slow it's decharge.<br /><br />As far as capacity is concerned this battery pack was good for about 4 to 5 charges. It also has the standard built in flash light which is more of a novelty than anything but can be useful if you do not have your smart phone.<br /><br />Besides it's size, the only down side is it's recharge time which take about 24 hours to fully charge it back up.<br /><br />Compared to other devices this one is fantastic and I would recommend spending the extra money but towards the end of it's life this will stop working well."
"Use this in my kayak for fishing/paddling trips all the time.  works great!  no issue with occasional water splashing or the like.  Charges the iPhone pretty well but will use a lot of the speakers battery for that, just FYI.<br />Just spent 3 full 10-16 hour days tearing off and re-roofing my house and this speaker was playing the entire day (on about 1/2 volume) non-stop each day. I did recharge each night but the fact that it can go 12+ hours on one charge at a decent volume is very impressive.  Sound is great too if its not at 100% volume (no speaker I've used sounds good at that level)."
I think this is actually a perfect gift for a teenager. You have many colors to choose from. This is the smallest selfie stick I have ever seen. Its small enough to fit in my clutches. I already used it with my husbands Galaxy S5 while his case was on. I was able to use it right away the only thing I had to do is connect the take line to the phone jack and I was ready to start taking pics. I believe in some phones you will have download an app. I was actually shocked that a small pen sized selfie stick could expand that long.<br />*I received this product for a discount price in exchange for an honest unbiased review.
Very nice protective screen.  Easy to apply and left no bubbles.
Very good product!
Doesn't fit my 5c as advertised waste of money
It allows me to have a docking station. Works well for what it cost.
I love it it glows in the dark lol
Good protection for my tablet. Fairly easy to apply.
"This is a great little stereo kit. I put this setup in a cooler for a float trip and now I will have to order more because several people I know want me to make them on.  Pros: - Kit includes everything you need to wire up the amp and speakers, plus has an aux hookup for phones, iPods, etc. - Speakers are decently loud and clear. As long as you don't play bass heavy music and have the volume cranked to max, these little speakers sound decent. - The amp is really small so it can fit in tight places (such as a cooler), or on an ATV or motorcycle.  Cons: - The volume knob it comes with is not very good. If you barely touch it the volume goes up drastically. Also a normal knob would increase gradually from 8 oclock to 4 oclock with 8 being off and 4 being maxed out. This knob maxes out around 11 oclock and the rest of the way does nothing. It doesn't get louder. This isn't a huge deal, just something I wanted to point out to people. - The waterproof bag that is meant to hold a cellphone or iPod is pretty small. Any modern cellphone in a case will probably not fit in the bag. You will have to remove the case most likely. My Galaxy S4 in a case wouldn't fit in the bag unfortunately.  Summary: This is a great kit for the money. If you are expecting super loud music that is as clear as a concert you are looking at the wrong product. I would like to remind everybody that the speakers are about $10 a piece and you truly do get what you pay for. I do believe that most people will enjoy this product if they keep in mind just how cheap it is. This kit works great for someone looking for some music in their boat, atv, or cooler. If you need something cheap, that doesn't sound too bad and is decently loud; go ahead and get this product. You won't be disappointed."
Love it thanks
Great product!
Don't take a chance on this cheap piece of crap. Just fork over $50 for a microsoft charger. This thing lasted a few days before cutting out completely and is not worth the $10 its priced at.
"Performed as advertised ensuring the phone was protected when dropped, however only issue was with regards to dust buildup between the cover and the phone which needed to be cleaned out every so often as I work in extremely dusty environments."
poor quality! There is a crack on the holder.
The transparent case shows off the beauty of the golden color of my iPhone 6 plus. It is also strong enough to be protective. Affordable price too.
did not fit on boat returned
"It works, but It doesn't fit with a case. I used it for 2 days maybe."
The car plug in broke within a week of using it.
Great
Love it
"This case looks very nice because you can see how pretty the phone is underneath while also providing protection. The downside is that it has rough spots where the mold was detached during the process of making it. They aren't horrible spots, just not what i normally expect from Spigen. The other downside is that dust and junk gets between the phone and case very easily. It requires taking the phone out and cleaning it every couple days.  UPDATE: I have moved this to one star because after having it on the phone for about a week I noticed today that there appeared to be smudges on the back of my phone under the case. So I took off the case and it wasn't smudges, but instead the case had left a sticky residue on the phone. The inside of the case felt sticky to the touch, and the dotted texture you see in the pictures was coming off. Very disappointed because I wanted the clear case to see the phone itself, but this one is not going to be it for me."
It was a genuine product and I love using it. The case looks like a genuine leather and it is strong enough to hold the tablet and safe gaurd it.
"This is a very easy to install phone holder. You simply slip the small metal plate on the inside of your phone cover and attach it to the magnet on the mount. The mount itself is small and unobtrusive. I have mine attached to the windshield by suction cup, although you could similarly mount it to the dash. It's difficult to understate the convenience of this holder. You literally just place the phone in front of the magnet and it attaches on. Good for most modern smart phones."
Great product
It was ok
Good product and on time delivery
Worth the buy!
Love my case shipping took to long
Great radio for the price. Awesome when it's paired with an apple device. Has a few small quirks but I can only imagine an upcoming update would take care of it. Tons of settings and user friendly.
Love this case! I use it everyday and it's saved my phone on many occasions
Perfect! Fast shipping! Would order again but hope I don't have to!
"[[VIDEOID:1daa652d4401127e4c9c520c61eaba18]] Please see the video for more info.<br /><br />Basically unless you have a really wide or really thick phone this should work well for you. It allows for single handed operation and it fits without damage to the CD slot. Once installed it remains firmly in place.<br />Adjustments are simple and offer a variety of angles, not much to dislike about it unless as stated your phone just doesn't fit.<br />I like that it doesn't really block too much in my particular setup and it allows for no blocking of my air vents...something I really try to avoid as much as possible when looking for a mounting solution.<br /><br />Review sample provided free or at a discounted price for a fair, unbiased, and honest review."
Really nice &#34;selfie stick&#34;  No more having to keep your &#34;stick&#34; charged and running out of juice in the middle of the day.  This stick (I bought the all black version) is well made and put together with care.
Seemed great at first but connection that plugged in to the device is flimsy. My previous cord lasted 2 Years this one didn't last a month
Nice!
Is well built and was able to charge my MS Surface 3 which no other power supply (other than the original) has been able to do.
Love it
really nice layout - so many of the outlets are configured so that you can't get to the usb outlets. comes with adapters for different phones
I purchased this battery through a daily deal. It seemed like a nice hefty battery pack and the digital display was a handy feature. Unfortunately after only 5 charge cycles the pack will no longer accept a charge. Too late to return to Amazon but I could pursue the 1 year warranty from Maxboost. Obviously it might not even be feasible to ship it back and forth.
wonderful - I love it!  Protects the phone and is durable.
"The phone case itself is really pretty and protects my phone (iPhone 6) just fine. However I think the color is a little different from the picture. I believe the one I received is lighter pink. It is very slippery and slips from my hand very easily.It also got very dirty quickly and I could not clean it. Again, it does serve its purpose as a phone protector."
This is a beautiful band. It is exactly like the Apple blue watchband and a lot less money. The quality is superb. Don't be afraid to order it at all. I am just so happy I did. It goes with everything and it was so easy to put on. I can't thank you enough. Diane Hebert
It´s the best phone ever
It got here in good time.  It fit's well.
"We use Square on an iPad in an Otterbox to check guests out. It's way easier than signing with a finger. We used to just buy the cheapest ones we could because the rubber tips would break in dry weather or after a particularly heavy handed customer. But the last set we bought we so unresponsive and the rubber broke so fast I started looking for another option. It's so frustrating trying to check someone out and switching through all the styluses before finally giving up and telling guests to just use their finger. These are so wonderful! I was hesitant about the metal mesh on them but our iPad cover is fine, absolutely no scratches (at least not from the stylus). All three write nice and smooth and are very responsive, even through the plastic cover. And I love that I can just replace the tips when they break instead of having to buy entirely new styluses. We tape feathers on them so it's nice not having to reattach the feathers when the pen wears out. One of the tips busted on the edge the first day which was a little disappointing. But now after a month of heavy use all the other tips are holding up just fine so I think that one was just a fluke."
"Protects my iPhone 6.<br /><br />Very large case. If place in pocket (for a guy), get ready for some awkward stares, as I have gotten many while walking across my college's campus.<br /><br />Only real con is that dust can easily get underneath the case.<br /><br />*** Putting the case on and taking it off ***<br /><br />The case snaps into place, you need to lift and push the corner and middle clips down. When removing, you need to the same thing. People have stated that it is tedious to remove, but when doing it correctly, it isn't hard at all."
Love it so far! Had an IPhone before. Like this better so far. The price I awesome!
"These headphones will only light up if they are charging. They will not pair with any of my devices. (ipad mini 3, galaxy 6s, windows phone). It is nearly impossible to tell if they are even on or not. Once you unplug, they will not light up again. In the seller instructions, it says that it would connect when the light was blinking red and blue... but it won't even blink. Charged for a few hours, but still nothing. I'm not sure it's even worth returning. Please do not buy these headphones. I'm hoping that the seller will get into contact with me."
"Exactly as advertised, quick delivery"
It is an awsome product. Protect your iPhone well and the material feels great.
very bad quality.. couldn't use it for 2 weeks
Very tight on head and gave me headaches. Not loud enough to cover road noise and no noise canceling mic
Super handy and light weight. This is great for outdoors use and camping and survival. A must to have in a bug out bag or disaster box. It is covered in a rubber like skin and has rubber plug covers that protect the usb ports from water. It has 2 usb ports to change two items at one time. It can be charged up with an external usb2 power supply or by it's built in solar panel.  It has a D ring included that allows you to hang it off the side of a tent or wall facing the sun so it can charge up. It's water proof so even if it rains when you leave it out for charging it wont be ruined. This solar charger is about the size of a large smart phone and a little thicker. I bought mine at a discount for an honest and fair review. I would say no different about this at it current price.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1.) Solar power portable.<br />2.) Water proof<br />3.) Rubber guard skin<br />4.) Portable and pack-able.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.) Not enough power to charge my ipad. It will charge all phones and some tablets.<br /><br />Pics:
"I really can't think of how to express exactly how excited I was when I got this solar charger, but even so,"
"I loved the case!  It fits my phone snugly.  You do have to press kind of hard for the buttons on the side, but it's really not that big of a deal!  Love it!"
It's great for that price you get something that looks good feels good.
Arrived quickly. Perfect.  No need to say more.
Love it! It works great.
"Wow, you will not find better Bluetooth headphones for under $25. They sound great, come with all the accessories that allow you to customize them to fit your ears perfectly. I really like the voice prompts, you know for sure if they are turned off."
Great sound and good Bluetooth connection skips a bit but not bad battery last about 6-7 hours. Good buy
Easy to install and works really well
Looks great. Functions nicely.
Very good protector for new 3ds xl
Flexibility plus! Now I won't have to figure out how to plug in all the different chargers. And it has enough juice for anything I throw at it.
I like very much
Great protective case but the screen protector was a little difficult to install.
The part that connects to the tablet broke after the first use. No kidding. The part that is important is actually the weakest part. I was so disappointed. The cord looked so high quality and beautiful.
Good!
Great for the old phones.
Very nice iphone 6 case if u like shaco. I enjoy it alot
Great case.  Very durable.  I have gotten several compliments on it.  Simple and not bulky.
doesnt work with my lg g3
Do Not order this for the Galaxy Prevail LTE (SM-G360P). This case is WAY TOO SMALL. Not even close.
"Pure crap.  ive spent literally hundreds on zagg screen protectors over the past several years.  And I've largely been satisfied. But when it comes to the glass for iPhone 6 I'm on my third protector in less than a year.  The edges seem to chip almost immediately upon install.  I even had the last two &#34;professionally&#34; installed but it made no difference .  Yes, zagg warrants their products but frankly dealing with warranty claims is a hassle.  At this point I've got a hundred bucks in protectors for this one phone alone.  All in a span of about seven months.  I will probably file a warranty claim this time and when the fourth one fails (and it will) I'll try another brand.  I'm not going back to a poly protector after experiencing glass.  But I'm not going to keep putting these crappy zagg ones on either..."
"It was good the first couple of days, then it turns off by itself, when I press the unlock button it takes like 30 seconds to show the unlock screen, battery drains way to fast not very happy"
"This is a pretty standard aftermarket third party Apple-Certified MFI Lightning cable for iPhone 5/6 and newer iPads.<br /><br />This is 1 meter long (3.2 feet approximately), the same as the factory Apple cables. I have this in Yellow color.<br /><br />Plugs on both ends feel secure. This has worked fine with each of my various Apple products, with no issues. It's also worked with both my car charger and wall chargers.<br /><br />The MFI plug on this is relatively small, like the original Apple plugs, so I haven't had any difficulty getting it to fit into my various iPhone case port openings. That's convenient.<br /><br />Sample sent for testing and impartial consumer review. This just works, and works fine. Seems well made. No complaints.<br /><br />I hope this is helpful as you comparison shop around. Happy travels, everybody."
My son loved it.
Thank you!
"Item arrived on time and in good condition. No extreme complaints about item quality except battery charge is often difficult to gauge.<br /><br />The only way to tell how well charged the the headset is, you must turn it on, and a voice will tell you &#34;Battery High&#34;, or &#34;Battery Medium&#34;, etc. It'd be more helpful if it had a better gauge like on a cell phone to inform me just how much &#34;medium&#34; is, since it seems to be a variable between only a couple hours to a whole day's worth of charge.<br /><br />But that's a very small issue. Just make sure it's plugged in at the end of the day and this headset will last the entirety of the next."
Received the wrong color and the hard shell fell apart when removing it
Tested on a 5hr flight on two different airplanes. ANC works; greatly minimized jet engine drones. Liked the open mic feature. It even enhanced the clarity of the announcements. BT4.0 even showed battery life in my mobile phone. Good soundstage. Clear highs. Balanced mid and low range. Highly recommended.
"Received very quickly, love suppliers who can deliver!  Does what it says, but knocked down a bit because of the disappointment finding out the phone needs to be placed on it pretty precisely in order for it to start charging (using Nexus 6).  Thought it would be a lot more convenient to simply place the phone right on top of it and that would be it but seems like there is a fair amount of slightly moving the phone around each time to find the &#34;sweet spot&#34; in order for it to start charging.  Tried without cases on, with, didn't matter.  -Edit to note that after using for a little while muscle memory begins to kick in and seems a lot easier now to place the phone on there lined up correctly so a bit of a learning curve in the beginning is all.  Charges fairly fast but compared to the Quick Charge cord provided by Motorola with the Nexus 6 it can't compare but not a huge deal for me, just an FYI for others."
Perfect!...
Nice!
"I got this free for testing and review purposes ,  I really like it High quality"
everything was great.
Was just as expected. Came in a timely manner
"I LOVE IT, ITS SOUNDS LOUDER THAN OTHERS HEADSET I HAVE, THEIIIIIRRRRRRRRR GREAT"
"After trying multiple cell holders in the car, I am still stunned by how much better this one is!!  So simple, and so perfect.  Literally makes me a better driver, because I'm never &#34;messing&#34; with a contraption to get my hands-free setup just right --- the magnet makes it effortless. Thanks for inventing! :)<br /><br />June 2016 Update -- I have re-ordered these 3 times as gifts for friends, because once they see mine in action they flip for it!  Several of us had tried other brands that didn't have strong enough magnet, so were frustrating to use.  Thanks for being strong, WizGear!! - K"
"I love this phone holder for my car!  I got this one and the shorter one, and I love them both.  Instead of keeping your phone in your pocket or in your bag/purse when you get in the car, put it on this phone holder.  It is so much more convenient!  The taller one is more flexible in it's use because of it's multiple adjustment settings.  It turns left, it turns right, it swivels around, so you can custom fit it for your personal preference.  It is very sturdy and very convenient.  I always keep my phone in my phone holder while driving because I'm directionally challenged so I'm always on my GPS.  This phone holder is great because it sits high, so I can look at my GPS and keep an eyes on the road.  It has adjustable EVERYTHING so it will basically fit in any car cup holder.  The workmanship on this is superior to other phone holders I have used in the past.  It isn't very bulky either so it doesn't really get in the way of anything else.  This is a great product for anyone that pretty much has a phone and a car."
"The rubber case is thin but you always get what you pay for. If you want your watch just to look cute with minimal protection against scratches then get this one but if you're going to drop your watch then i'd say get a little more hardcore case. I love it though, happy with my purchase! might get a different color!"
Returned...broke within 3 weeks and the rubber plug ripped.
"Fantastic product! I had my bike parked in a bike rack that was near where a tornado was forming. My phone stayed safe and secure with no damage at all. Highly recommend this product. I suggest using a bluetooth headset for music and calls so that the case can be secure. It comes with adjustable foam pads to help you use it, which was a great idea."
Don't buy this product! It stopped working less than three months after I purchased it.
You can use all of the phone features while it is in the waterproof bag.
good case protects my 4 year old nephew from breaking the tablet
"This case looks, feels, and fits great. However the first time I dropped my phone with this case from around 2ft, the case broke instantly. Would not recommend if you drop your phone often."
"Love it. It works perfectly fine. the phone tilts to the side a little bit and if the phone case is too heavy then it will fall, but otherwise it works fine."
"This is probably the best phone mount I've ever owned. Solid, sturdy, and fits a Nexus 6. Would definitely buy this again."
I have two of these in a 94 camaro on 30 00 watts @ 2ohms an it's so loud I can be herd 3 blocks away I love them an I'm about to buy 2 more to add to it awesome sound an really durable I have them way overpowered an still they hold up great sub!!!!
The case is sturdy and eye pleasing. It is bulky but manageable more in a purse than a pocket. The clip is handy. Glad my search is over. Worth the price.
Great!
I have an iPhone 5s carrier lock was sprint It did not work I ended up just pay more money for an unlock that did work
"Fit and worked well, get price."
"Good quality, excellent for the job"
It looks cool and charges faster than a regular one.
"RECEIVED STARTED SOLDERED NEG. AND POS. 10 AWG RED ON CAPACITOR SIDE .<br />HOOKED UP TO BACK OF YAQIN MC-100B FOR 4 OHMS TERM. SOUND CRISP BETTER<br />THAN EXPECTED . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED , WILL BUY ANOTHER SET . LOVE THE CRISP<br />AND LOUD MATCHED/COMBO WITH DEFINITIVE 450 ."
Wonderful! I love this case. It fits incredible my Galaxy S6 edge. Four stars just because the shipping delay.
Good strong. Hope it holds up!
"As a family of four we were always fighting over who got to use the one or two USB charging ports in the car, until we bought this.  I've tried other chargers that have two or three ports but none would deliver a reliable charge if you used all of the ports.  This one is different. Even with two phones and two tablets charging at the same time none of the devices complain about a lack of power.<br /><br />We give it eight thumbs up."
A+
"Perfect! They work so well (: the one tmobile gave me broke, but now I have 2 that hopefully will last."
"Awesome looking case, makes the phone standout more than your average, cheaper cases. The one star off is for the case being a tad loose, it allows debris to enter the case and traps it there."
Easy setup. Nice design and I like the added led lights while phone is charging. Charges phone about as fast as standard charger. I drain the battery nightly and simply place my phone on top before bed and wake up to a fully charges phone. Cheaper than some other 3rd party chargers and more visually pleasing in my opinion. Great buy.
Works well
"This device solved a real problem for me; the proliferation of adapters for tablets and phones.  I just run the various cables from this box to my devices and it makes everything very simple.  Charging isn't a process to manage, but simply a chore that is easily accomplished.  Great idea."
this is the best portable charger fir iPad it charged 3 full charges and my phone about 5 full charges before it needed to be charged its self grate for long over seas travel
Lasted 2 months and the silicone busted. The plastic protectant case is ok but the red silicone busted quickly
"I was very skeptical and used it this weekend to charge my phone, my wife's phone and friends phone.  (All iPhone 6). I went camping and in the beginning it charged my phone fine and fast however I would go back every once in awhile to check on it and it would stop charging even in direct sunlight and would say device is not supported.  I would have to keep unplugging and re-plugging it in to start charging again.  Later that day I tried charging my phone again and it stopped at 75% and wouldn't go beyond it for an hour in direct sunlight.  It looked like the panels were warping slightly.  I tried plugging my phone to my car and it's as if the unit did something to my iPhone where it froze from charging beyond the 75%!?.  I had to do a hard reset on the phone and luckily it started charging again.<br /><br />If I have to keep checking I it to see if it's charging and re-plugging it in to make it work leaves me with no confidence in a real world emergency situation.<br /><br />Sorry thought it was going to be great, but sending it back!"
I love this case but the eyelet that the wrist strap hooks to is faulty. It easily comes loose which leads to the strap ripping the case.
"Awesome product. Very nice and sleek. I usually charge 4 devices at once, two iPhones and two iPads, and it does it with ease. Plus, it has a great warranty."
great product
Very strong simple design at appropriate price. Paired with a dashboard mount from another company; very sturdy.
Does exactly what it's supposed to
Fit phone perfectly.
Sorry just not what I expected
Awesome.  My daughter used it on her cross-country road trip and it both performed great and was very useful.
The anchor fell off on day two of having it and the plastic part that holds your actual phone snapped when I put the phone in the case for the first time! Waste!
It actually feels a lot sturdier then the original Apple cable.
This product did not work it was a waist of my money
"I love it !! It's so pretty , and it's colors are beautiful and bonus its protects your phone to the max"
Get what you pay for. Program won't work for Note 4 when it says it will
"Nice and will help protect the tablet, but is heavy!!"
"Absolutely great. Sturdy. Great attention to detail. Phone fits well, and all controls are readily accessible. The only improvement that could be made is adding a magnet, but no complaints here!"
Seems to be charging my iPad Air just fine!
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
The pins are so rigid they can not be spread to fit snugly in any outlet. This charger takes almost twice as long as the OEM unit to charge my phone and tablet.
band broke after 2 weeks and item lost
"The Stallion iPhone 5 case is everything I expected. I like that I can plug in the headphones without removing the phone from the case/belt clip. Case is very durable and protects my phone very well.  I know this because I've already dropped my phone by mistake several times, and not a scratch!"
Amazing
It's very cheap. It cracked the first time my son dropped it from 2 feet off the ground. Throwing this away and will find a quality one
Charges fast as earlier posts had indicated. It's now the only charger I use when travelling in my vehicles.
Work as a police officer needed something when I ride the quad on the beach to hear.
Good quality and outlook making the phone heavier
Update: 9/10/2015<br /><br />A replacement was shipped by the seller unprompted. The replacement functions as it should.  This seller stands behind their product.  I feel confident that the initial unit I received was defective.<br /><br />worked for one charge.  Now it will add about 4% to my Samsung s5 and it is dead.  Look elsewhere.
"Improved my internet service, we went from no bars to 4 bars with this antenna."
Hey it wrks
"I started having issues with cheaper lightning cables not charging my iPhone 5S, or my wife's iPhone 6.  So I tried the Apple MFi Certified ones.  So far they are working great!"
"Came with various fittings to accommodate a  comfortable fit. They hold up on runs and workouts, and they've lasted me over 3 hours on a single charge. A little too much bass for my taste but it was still a great buy"
"cheap I was very careful and it didn't last even one season of boating. closure fell apart. It did float, but just fell apart after awhile."
Can't live without these now
"Fast delivery, excellent product!"
This smartphone holder for my bike was just what I was looking for.  Received it quickly and everything is terrific.  Thank you Vibrelli for doing what you do so well.
Don't be decieved. This case is definitely stylish looking but that's as far as it goes. The case itself is very flimsy and offers very little if any in the way of drop protection. Also there is no front lip to help protect the screen in case of a fall. Very disappointed I'm not sure why it got some good reviews.
Excellent!!!
"Can not get it to charge can not get it to work, waste of money"
Use it for to send audio bluetooth radar detector alerts to my motorcycle helmet intercom system. Works great. You do not need a mono to stereo adapter between the detector and transmitter. You will only get alerts through one speaker (mono) but it works.
"Nice wallet case, Gorgeous delicate design and color."
This case was perfect it fit my daughters iPod perfectly she actually connected the keychain to the case she loves it I give this five stars😊 I am happy with what I got
Good quality item
Great cover and does exactly as I suspected; protects my phone completely.
I love this case! It got pretty dirty pretty fast but it's easy to clean. But all cases like this get dirty really fast. And for the price it was perfect
Came in super fast looks brand-new for other viewers you could come in a Ziploc baggie but it's brand-new it's awesome .<br /><br />They shipped really fast I hope they ship all the time out this fast thank you
LIKE THS PRODUCT AS WELL
The hinge is not really durable!
Too bulky. Had to send back
"I like the picture on it, but I wish it gave my phone a little more protection."
"From the packaging of this product to the user friendly functionality of this item is exceptional.  If you're on the go - get this stick, take explosive pics, & share them with the world!"
Love this thing. Allows me to simultaneously charge my Nexus 7 and my Galaxy Note phablet phone. Only occupies one AC outlet which can be a blessing when traveling.
good product
Loves this case
"Good price ,works good!"
I could not use my smart phone with out one of these.  The best part is that they fit into the phone so you do not keep looking for it when you need it
"very sturdy case, arrived ahead of schedule"
Love how I can show the color of my phone and originality with this case simple and pretty.
This product works great.  We have two IPhones and two IPads hooked up to this where we sit.  It works great and I highly recommend it.  The company did a great job packaging it and getting it to me on time.  I probably will order another one for the bedroom.
"I tried this device on macbook pro, nexus 7, and windows tablet and they works fine. I currently use it mostly on windows tablet.<br />While on macbook pro, keyword works fine and the mouse pad seems a bit sluggish. I didn't try to adjust setting since my purpose was to try it out only. Other than that, this product works pretty good. One click or button to wake up the device. Once first recognized by computer, following connections are easy. Fist connect to windows device seems a bit harder but it can be windows issue because similar problem happened to other Bluetooth devices as well."
"Perfection, arrived quickly ahead of time, friends tell me (I can't see ur screen, is ur phone off) perfect!"
"I just came back on a long 6hr oceanic flight and the battery lasted the whole flight.  It's true that these, as labeled, are actually less mAh than the original battery.  I was initially concerned because I charged both the new battery and an OEM battery in another nook, then ran a looping video player on both, and after a few hours the new battery seemed to be a few percentage less than the original OEM.  I was thinking of returning it if it couldn't even keep up with a 5yr old nook.  However, after about 3 hours the original OEM took a quick nosedive whereas this one kept going with the same level discharge curve.  This is exactly what we found on the flight as well.  The only problem now is that I have to upgrade my wife's nook as well!<br /><br />I googled for a Youtube installation video and that was very accurate.  No problems following the instructions.  The OEM battery has a small buffer around the battery to fit the opening a little better but I haven't noticed any problem with this battery in the slightly larger opening.  The only trick I found with reinstalling it is that the triangular cover with the rubber straps sometimes won't fit; it's easier if you pull the cover out completely and then after it's closed use a small screwdriver to push the rubber straps back in - they fit one way and won't pull out.<br /><br />I think any 5yr old nook can probably benefit from this battery, but before you do that you might also take a quick look at your battery cable and connector.  On one of my nooks the battery wasn't charging so I bought this replacement.  It turns out that afterwards it still wasn't.  Upon closer inspection both the cable & port on the nook were damaged.  That's why the cable felt a little weird plugging it in.  In the end, I had to give up on that nook because there's no way to repair that port.  Fortunately I had another nook to put the new battery into."
Got this for a replacement for my sons phone. His wouldn't hold a charge anymore. When this one came in he put it in his phone right away and it has worked great and will hold a charge.It had a 75% charge on it when we got it in the mail. It fit his phone just like it came with his phone.
Pouch fits the Galaxy S4 and seems to have room for S6 as well.  Construction is pretty good.  Definitely works better for smartphones that the 5.11 Tactical phone pouch.
"Excellent Product and great quality, I use it for my ATV and it worked perfectly!"
Thank you!
They are ok.
Good case
Is what they say
very good item good price too
Yes I like this.  Works on surfaces and case type material you wouldn't expect.
Worked great for charging but did not work for the data in my car radio
"The sound is good, but tends to break up and stutter a lot.. not very smooth listening"
Great item
works well
It has no screen protection whatsoever.  I thought it may come up further around the edge to protect against dropping it but it doesn't.  All this is is a pretty case.
The same as the $40 one in stores just nicer on the wallet. I'm really rough on phones so I keep one in reserve so when I break it I can switch it out. So far they've lasted longer than the ones I've payed full price for
Fit was good...kickstand a little tough to pullout..
"I placed my phone in this case, a couple of weeks later I removed the top part in order to clean my phone and the entire screen came off with it. Would not purchase again. iPhone 5S."
Love it!!
"It's unfortunate that this phone is not Sprint compatible and I'm unable to activate it with my current carrier. That being said, it is a nice phone. Decent size. Has a great camera (the camera is fabulous! better than the one on our iPhone 6) and is an affordable low price. Just do the research before buying to make sure you can use it with your carrier."
"Very nice portable battery with a sleek design. I take it with me almost everything I go. I have a 6 plus so this is a must + if you're a heavy user like me, you'll definitely need one. Great price and way more powerful than battery case."
Great idea and design but the sticky pad doesn't support the weight of an iphone6 plus and keeps falling off
"I have used one since I got it,  it was easy to install."
Great buy
I've had this case for about three days now and it's great. Does what a case is suppose to do without adding bulk or hiding the iPhones sleek look. Logo is on the side so it won't show up on the back like most cases. Fits snug and has good grip when holding so you know it won't slide out of your hand
I've had these for several months now. They are still working great. I've bought alot of cheap ones that usually stop working after a couple of weeks. I have a feeling these will last awhile. My only complaint is that the platic head that surrounds the tip that plugs into the iphone is big so it may not work with some screen protectors.
Simply plug into your QI compliant phone and you can use wireless charging block station insread a plug-in charger. Quicker and ensures phone stays charged.
Rapid charger! Charges very quickly which is what I need!
Nice case
This makes carrying everything in you want in one place.
Great length and works!
"Beautiful case, well constructed considering the low price. After having the case for about a month, color is fading a bit on the spine of the case."
"I read a great review about this product on another site, and it's become the main charging hub for everyone, wherever I go. Very portable, and solid. I also bought of short USB cables to go with it. It detaches from it's power adapter leaving a short cable dangling from the charging base. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is, but it seems pointless. On the other hand, it doesn't detract from the overall functionality, which is perfect."
"This low profile power adaptor provides two USB connectors so we can charge two phones, phone and iPad, etc.  I like the low profile -- when you don't have anything plugged into it the cover on the power plug folds down almost closed (I have another non-low profile adaptor and it sticks out of the power plug like a short hot dog)"
Awesome product! Exactly what I wanted!
"It is amazing and very helpful,, i never had any problem with it and i like that it is small so i can always keep it with me in my handbag.."
Runs out of juice faster than I thought it would
WORKING PERFECT SO FAR
"Works great, wether charging 1item, or 4. Haven't tried 5 or 6 at a time yet."
Ok but not as thick as I thought
"Great product, awesome price, fits lots of cards, license insurance etc plus you could throw some paper money in there also."
Fits watch perfectly. Nice feel. Looks like the original. I will buy again in another color.
"Works well.  The shipping is slow though.  Ship from China.  The material looks cheap, but didn't affect the functionality.  It works well."
"works as advertised!  Takes awhile to charge, but can charge many iPhones and other items."
"GOT THIS PHONE FOR MY MOTHER AND SHE LOVES IT.THE LARGE NUMBERS MAKE IT EASY TO USE AND THE RING TONE IS VERY LOUD.SHE ALSO LIKES THE HANDY LCD LIGHT WHICH SHE USES TO GO OUTSIDE TO LET OUT THE DOGS AT NIGHT.IT'S RUBBERIZED BODY MAKES IT EASY TO GRIP,AND IT FEELS VERY STURDY."
"We have owned this charger for five months. It works great with our Apple Products: iPad Mini, iPad Retina, iPhone 5 and iPhone 6. It charges our devices as quickly as the chargers that came with them. Never have had any issues with it.<br /><br />I do wish I had read other reviews about the insanely bright blue light that emits from this charger when it is plugged in. I wish that it did not have this, but it does remind us to unplug it when not in use."
Great Case very satisfied with product.
Exactly what I was looking for.
"Very happy with this unit. Long battery life, three size ear pieces, TWO ear hooks. Decent quality audio."
All good
"Very pretty, strap not made well"
Exactly as described! ! Fit the phone great.
Did not protect my screen from a 2 foot fall.  Phone slid off a couch and dropped flatly onto a tile floor.  Short drop overwhelmed the tiny lip over the screen and uniformly shattered the screen.  Repair of $109 at Apple Store.
my daughter likes it.  good product.  arrived within a week.
"IF YOU HAVE 2012 AND NEWER MACS- DO NOT BUY. THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE. AFTER RESEARCHING AND CALLING APPLE SUPPORT- I FOUND OUT THIS DOESNT WORK ON NEW MACS BECUASE THEY DO NOT COME W/ INFARED .....<br /><br />YOU CAN DOWNLOAD ANY APP AND USE IT TO PLAY MUSIC, NETFLIX, HULU, ETC. I DOWNLOADED HIPPO LITE AND IT WORKS JUST FINE.<br /><br />HAD TO RETURN AND GOT A REFUND"
Great for the cost
"Very satisfed with the sound quality, and the pairing was totally painless.  This is a great product and I highly recommend this product to others."
Great product strong and we'll bulit
Perfect fit and fast shipment.
Simple to mount and use.  Works great.  Excellent price (on sale).
Love this product! Came right away...and was easy to put on...Perfect fit for my phone!
"Don't buy! This worked well for a couple weeks, and now when I plug my phone in to charge, it won't charge. It says something like this accessory isn't supported. I'm so frustrated, and it's too late to return it now."
"Works well, good price."
Sucks!!!!!!
Very happy with the purchase. I have paired to both my iPhone and Apple watch and they are comfortable plus have very good sound.
"A little nicer than pictured , no square hole in the back"
Great
great item
Fit and looked great
"Good afternoon the products have not reached this far, although I have written have not answered"
Shipping was crazy fast. Product is exactly as described. Worth every penny. I'll definitely be shopping here again
"Although this is fairly outdated now due to the new lightning connector, this is a sturdy little device you can get a quick, one time charge out of in a pinch. Is fairly slow to recharge, but aside from that, nice device."
"First things I noticed: It's compact and of course, fold-able. It's a bit larger than my iPad Mini when folded. It has a sturdy design (securely stitched) and the panels are sewn into the panels as well. There is no need for fumbling with any cables and searching where to plug - there is a pocket that houses a USB port that is already connected. Simply plug in your cable for your device and charge.<br /><br />The instructions are clear and right on point. (My husband and I actually went back and forth on this, because he was determined that the panel needed to charge via sunlight prior to being used at all). Not at all- you just unfold and place in direct sunlight, connect your device to the output with it's original cable, and store the device in the pocket [note: when I was test-charging my tablets, I tucked them under the flap with the pocket to keep them out of the sun, directly] The 3 simple steps would make this easy for anyone.<br /><br />Testing:<br /><br />DAY ONE: My first day testing this, it was partly cloudy. I also had placed it on the rail of my deck, which I thought had a pretty clear shot of sun hitting it. I tried my iPhone first and when a cloud passed over, I lost the charge. My phone popped up a &#34;device is not compatible message&#34; so I unplugged it and plugged it back in after the clouds had passed. I didn't get much of a charge in partly-cloudy conditions, however my device maintained it's battery level.<br /><br />DAY TWO: I was happy to have mostly clear skies and full sun (just a few intermittent clouds).  I placed the panel on my kids' picnic table directly in the sun and connected my son's Samsung Galaxy Note tab to it. The battery was at 77 percent when I plugged it in, and in roughly 1 1/2 hours it was up to 89 percent. For a tablet, that is not bad at all. I also plugged my iPad in and it charged it up 5 percent in upwards of an hour - I might add it was starting to get cloudy when I got around to testing the charge on my tablet, so I'm hoping the weather will cooperate so I can get a better idea and post it here this week. (as well as my phone)<br /><br />I'm impressed with how well this device worked in cloudy conditions here in Ohio. I would definitely recommend this product to others, but I would also recommend having a back-up plan like a portable battery pack, especially if you are going on an extended trip, camping, or are uncertain of the weather conditions ahead. My children were even excited about this charger and were thrilled that it doesn't need to be 'charged'.<br /><br />*I received this product at a promotional discount for testing and evaluation purposes in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.e so I can get a better idea and post it here this week.

can't go wrong with intex. we use this at Santa Catalina Island. we get more compliments and fun comments as people cruise by us. It is very comfortable and will hold 4 adults on the couch and 2 in the seats!
Don't give a bad review because you didn't do the research and ordered the wrong part.
"it fit my 2005 mercury mariner great, and looked good with the existing console, my new radio looks pretty good and the install went smoothly."
"I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....<br /><br />This is my first time using a Qi Wireless Charger, PLESON Ultra-Slim Qi Wireless Charging Station. I just got a galaxy S6. It is compatible with this wireless charger. This is so easy to use. You just set your phone on top and make sure the connection was made. You'll know it's charging when the indicator light on the front is blinking. I like that you can charge a variety of different electronics. I have 5 people in my household that all have smartphones.  The pad itself is sturdy and small. It has a rubber piece on top to make sure the phone doesn't slide off. Although it did not charge my phone as fast as it normally would when it's plugged in, but it did get the job done"
Love this case.
Good quality
"It's a snug fit, but it works."
"I bought phone in Jan, problems started in April...broken by the 3rd month of owning.  I must restart the phone every time I want to charge it. Phone is not recognized by the BB link, The camera screen would blink green...<br />Issues are STILL not resolved.  Their customer care  resolution...to update software without plugging in and would lose my data.  Software has been updated and the phone STILL has the same problems<br /><br />I paid $600 bucks for this phone.  BlackBerry does not have a solution nor will they give me a new phone.<br />Their customer care is obviously out of the US since the only time they called me back was over 4th of July and didnt leave a message.  There for they determined the ticket was closed.<br /><br />Sadly, this issue is the very same problem they had years back...too bad BlackBerry hasn't changed their service at all.<br /><br />Disappointed...money wasted"
"Unless you buy from Apple, all iPhone 6 screen replacements are sub par.  I've bought 4 different ones from 3 vendors, and I found the more expensive iCracked is the better of all."
"Very good case. Protects phone well. Easy to assemble and take apart. Only thing is water gets trapped easily (sweat, a droplet, etc) and then you can't use touch. You HAVE to take it apart and get the water out."
"I've had this Bluetooth transmitter for a couple of months now and has yet to fail. I use it everyday, and always works flawless. A great addition to your car if you have an older model vehicle that doesn't have AUX or Bluetooth. It comes with a 2.5 V USB adapter which enables you to charge tablets/iPads. I use this transmitter with an iPhone and have no compatibility issues, it even charges my iPhone to 100% charge in less than an hour."
good cell.
100% satisfaction
good one
Works great considering I have the galaxy S6 curve. The curved screen presents a problem for most cases. I tried 3 other cases before this one.
Perfect fit and easy to use.
"Pros: Great that its water resistant, back up battery , answer phone calls with it.  Good back up speaker.  Cons: sound quality"
Best fit of any cover I've ever had. Very solid. Meets all expectations.
It fits came in great packaging
It works well o can charge at least 4 things rather quickly
Exactly what I have been needing! Our bed is located in a goofy place in our bedroom and phone charger cords are just a pain to deal with every night before bed! So much easier to just place my phone down and know it's going to be charged by morning!
"works well, great price"
Working great!  Worth the price.
All Great!
Just as described.
Very nice case but did not fit my cellular.
I love this case! Cute and holds up well!
Very ugly!!
the glove really protects. I've dropped the phone like 4 times since I bought it and the phone is fine.  only problem is the button on the side for volume is hard to push.
Perfect item. Buy it.
"This 4 foot long cable works perfectly with our daughter's iPhone 5c and our son's iPhone 6 (4.7).<br /><br />It was delivered right on time and in perfect condition. Nice fit on both, and it feel substantially built especially in comparison to the thinner plastic cables we have had. Even works just fine with the cases both have on their phones.<br /><br />If you are looking for a high quality, Apple certified, 4 foot long lightning cable for your Apple equipment, based on our kids' experience with this one we highly recommend trying this Letouch product.<br /><br />Excellent trouble-free cable so far.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from a seller, without obligation, and have decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing review reflect that testing experience."
I got a otterbox for mine and this for my brothers. It's thinner then the otterbox by far but does a good job of protection on the corners.  My only complaint is I think the rubber should be a little thicker. Those with petite hands my find it very comfortable though.
very good
Works great and provides great protection!
Granddaughter loved it. What more can I say.
Very nice
"Won't hear crap, changed every speaker in the truck to the best but this doesn't have no power, piece of crap"
"Got them as a gift and they're great! Perfect for physical activity, they stay in your ears, and just throwing in your bag quickly because they don't tangle."
"i have had the case for around a year and it is great! amazing how this thin layer of protection has held up, i love the feel and how it grips to surfaces so it doesn't slip. Another great product from NOOT!"
All Great
This car charger would not charge my iPhone 6. It said accessory not compatible with this device on my screen then I plugged it in and it wouldn't charge.
I bought 2 of these on July 12 2015 and the touch screen on both of them went out already. How can we fix this problem?
Cheap Apple knockoffs with horrible sound.
Awesome product.  Fits and looks great!
Great product.
"Perfect for what I needed to go kayaking and sailing. Fits my big Note 4 perfectly and yes you can take pictures, video and use the phone inside the bag (turn off fingerprint authentications though since that won't go through the plastic). I would pair it with a floating key fob to make sure it doesn't sink."
Nice holder
All ok
"Good: The sound quality is OK, but is a bit &#34;tinny&#34;. The fit is a bit unusual, but once you get used to putting them in, it's not so bad. Very lightweight and easy to use.<br /><br />Bad: Something has shorted out in my set within the first few days of use. Whatever blew out partially MELTED the controller next to the &#34;volume down&#34; button and has left the unit smelling burned and completely non-functional. I'd give it a lower rating, but I know that this might not be typical for these products. Still, it clearly tried to catch on fire, so that's not something I'm particularly happy about either."
I purchased this in March 2015 and it only lasted until 8/30/15.
"Great product!  Very happy with this purchase.  Excellent for frequent travelers who need to share a AC outlet with a lamp etc plus also want to plug in your phone, ipad, Apple watch, external batter and toothbrush.  It works great!"
Very nice. Hooked this up to dual voice cool infinity subwoofer 2 ohms and bridged it to one ohm. You can hook this to your stock speakers for signal. For the price you can't beat it! Use this on stock stereo for some extra thump. Not recommended for someone trying to beat the did off or competition but my infinity has plenty of power shakes mirrors and everything but doesn't dim the lights
The best.
"This was an awful purchase...the first thing I noticed when I opened the package was the pink x's on the water strip...the battery has water damage! I thought, oh well...maybe it will work long enough for me to charge my phone and transfer everything off of it, but it didn't work any better than my doorstop would have plugged up in my phone."
"Great customer service, great watch :)"
Great item
Works perfectly and well. Only issue is that the wire could be longer. But well worth the money.
Got what I ordered.  Works great.<br />Marty S
"Protected my phone from numerous drops, but scratches and chips easily."
These replacement charging port covers are excellent quality and fit perfectly.
Came as advertised. My daughter has the pink iPhone 5c and she loves it!
"The case is tailor made for the Bose SoundLink Mini.  The speaker fits snugly into the main compartment.  The charging base, wall plug, and charging cord fit snugly into the top compartment.  Nothing moves when the case is zippered; all is stable.  The case is well constructed for the purpose it serves: keep all parts of the Bose system together and protected from mild impacts and sharps damage.  If there have been tests for severe impacts such as dropping from a height of several feet, I am unaware of the results.  The case has hard walls surrounding the unit which should protect from sharp and blunt impacts, but there is no real padding to insulate the speaker unit from vibrational damage associated with being dropped or thrown off a rack or shelf.  The zipper is good quality and I like the colorful and interesting &#34;Khanka&#34; metal zipper pull.  The small strap and its attachment loop are OK for the empty case but don't seem durable enough to carry the the weight of the speaker.  This is the main area for improvement that I would advise.<br /><br />On the other hand....the Khanka EVA hard case is a good looking, space efficient, well constructed, easy to use and lightweight case. The price is excellent for the features and protection provided:  I highly recommend it.  Let your backpack or suitcase do the rest!"
"Pretty disappointed. I installed on my 33' motorhome. It seems like any little thing causes it to fuzz up the image (static from the wireless reception.) It's cheap and hopefully as we've all learned, you get what you pay for. I just didn't feel like spending several hundred dollars on a system. It'll do but if you want a reliable rear camera wireless system, this isn't the one for you."
"I seriously love this thing. If you're worried about the friction added by some screen protectors, look no further. This protector is buttery smooth. I haven't compared to the phone's bare glass, but switched to this protector from a softer plastic protector (which came free with my phone). I couldn't be happier with the improvement (and I wasn't expecting it to be so noticeable). And unlike with the other protector, I don't see any signs of scratching (even after a few weeks, the old one was looking sorry--better than scratches on the phone's glass of course).  This works with the [[ASIN:B00I3UWEIA Galaxy S5 Case, Spigen Slim Armor Case for Galaxy S5 - Electric Blue (SGP10753)]], there's only a slight gap between the protector and the case, so coverage is also pretty good.  Note that this is a flexible but fairly hard plastic material, I believe &#34;ballistic glass&#34; is a synthetic (real glass is too rigid to stand up to much punishment).  When mounting, I suggest lining it up with the screen protector's backing still in place. Use scotch tape to attach the bottom edge of the screen protector to the bottom of the phone, lift the protector off from the top (without disturbing the tape, or else it might become misaligned), do any additional wiping/cleaning, then remove the backing and lower it back into place.  Update 1/12/2017: I've been using these regularly for awhile now. They've cracked a couple of times, probably saving my screen from being damaged, and I'm on my third one now. I drop my phone a lot, sometimes multiple times a day (usually from just a couple of feet off the ground). These screen protectors plus the Spigen case have kept things mostly protected, although one bad fall put a ding in the bottom bezel (which is not touched by this screen protector)."
Takes care of customers
"Works good and serves it's purpose,it was difficult however to line up properly"
2 of the 3 charging heads broke off within a week under normal use. The level of quality is reflected in the price. Be very gentle if you choose to purchase.
Good cables
Sucks!!!! Didn't fit my tab like it says it would..
It's a nice phone case.  It's not bulky yet it provides ample protection for the phone.  Looks nice too.l
This is a very cute and practical phone case. It seems to be well made and fits perfectly. It was very easy to put on and the colors I just like the ones in the picture. I gave it four stars because the screen was very difficult to put on yet even though I'm not very carefully and there was no dice on the phone when I put it on it still had bubbles that I could not get out of it.  Overall though a very well-made product.<br /><br />I did receive this product for free or at a discount for an honest and unbiased review and that is what I have given you today.
This is a very sturdy looking retractable charging cord. It retracts really well and the flat design keeps it from tangling. I bought it based on all the wonderful testimonial reviews. Especially from owners of iPhones. Imagine my disappointment when I first plugged it into my iPhone 6 and I received an error message saying it's not compatible with my phone.
"This is a great opening tool. The thin metal makes it easy to get into many tight spots that other opening tools can't get into. The vinyl coating that makes the handle makes the tool reasonably comfortable to use as well as providing adequate grip on the tool. The tool is flexible but still stiff enough to use effectively. I'ts thinness as well as its, shape and size makes it ideal for getting under the glass for removal. I have used this on phones, tablets and laptops for the purpose of glass replacement and it has proven extremely useful in all situations.<br /><br />This tools is metal and can damage the bezel and or the LCD. Caution is required to not scratch or damage the LCD. However, this tool is often the one that I use to get an opening started so that I can get other tools that are less likely to cause damage to the LCD between the bezel and the glass. If I'm careful I can use this tool to get around the entire glass without causing any damage from the tool."
"amazing quality, very useful, thin and protective"
"Fits well, but both pieces are hard plastic.<br /><br />Failed to prevent damage to phone from accidental drop like my previous case was able to (Seidio Active)"
runs a little small<br />perfect condition<br />Thank You!
It looks nice but if you own an apple watch spot band you know what it feels like this ban is thin but I was told by the makers that it would not break and it is good quality and tested I will try for a week and give an update
It is flexible and brings in good reception
"This the second one I bought.  Great price for a great product, if only I would stop losing them!"
"Love this case I am even gonna look and see if they h ave any other styles, seems very durable as I very rarely drop my phone but the other day I stood up to greet someone forgetting my phone was on my lap and it fell on to concrete, everything A-Okay !!!!!  I would recommend this case for the simple fact I have been very happy with it and it survived the fall."
This otterbox was a lifesaver but it broke late week when I wad just touching the rubber part. I was barely touching it and it snapped. I can't return it or replace it because the 30 days have passed :(
It looks pretty cheap in person. Doesn't look like it would protect my phone either. You get what you pay for.
I love these tempered glass protectors. This is the third purchase i made on this same iCarez protector brand. It has kept my iPhone's screen beautifully protected since a few years now. Very good quality product. I  really love how my phone hardly gets any fingerprints for regular use; i would need to have very filthy or greasy hands in order to smudge the screen. Totally worth it!
Cheaply made. Basically trash. Ended up throwing it in garbage. Disgusting!
Very nice cover  for the price
Good..
Works great but the stand once you use it keeps popping out.  Have to use tape to hold in place so it dont pop open when walking.
The case seemed to have been protective but I guess I droped it one to many times & not only did the case break my screen us also broken I would not recommend this product fir someone who always drops their phone or anything else for that matter
Works as advertised.
good
"Works well and charges fast. Product exactly as described, low price, fast shipping. Buy with confidence from this vendor"
Good product and easy to set up.
Love this case - not too bulky and very protective!
"Easiest screen protector installation yet. Fit is good, however the glass does cover the camera lens. It seems to have no effect on the camera though. Feels like the phone's original glass, and so far seems more resistant to finger prints."
"Foam not good, clips ok so far..."
I'm very unhappy with this item.  It has very low memory and the internal storage filled very vast
The color fades away
Holds all my credit cards and more. Looks great too!
It doesn't work on my note 4 or Samsung galaxy s4
Excellent
It looks great for G note 3
Excellent
"Love it! This is a replacement for an older 7-8 year model that finally gave up. Works great with great distance detection, loud volume options and the GPS feature on alert tells you your current speed. The blue readout is great at night, but hard to see in bright sun unless it is on the Max setting. You cannot go wrong with this unit."
This thing is great! Used it at my wedding and it was a lot of fun. Highly recommend. No battery needed and very easy to use! Even bought my dad one!
the best thing ever!
"Very nice, smooth to touch. I usually have problems with regular plastic screen protectors. I accidentally scratch those, a bit of it will come off but since the matte is so smooth, it's impossible to scratch. Comes with three also so it's worth it!"
FANTISTIC THAT WE COULD FIND THIS ITEM REPRESENTING BAYLOR UNIVERSITY.
I got this so I can navigate or talk on the phone hands-free using the speaker mode. I didn't find myself using it as much as I had hoped to. I wasn't comfortable with my phone strapped to the steering wheel. It does block my view of my speedometer which I didn't like. I went with another phone holder that attaches to the vent which works so much better.
Kills the battery super faster. with the blue tooth. even when it's in airplane mode.
This screen protector does not fit iPhone 6 properly as described.<br />Not recommended.
Great product - and price was good
It was a stolen phone very dissatisfied
Perfect love it
"Not what I expected!  The volume/pitch/clarity from the earpiece is EXCEPTIONAL.  I made two test calls- one to my Grandmother and one to my business partner and both had nothing but great reception and volume.  The button on the earpiece to hang up is AWESOME, wasn't expecting that!!  If you currently use one of those headsets that has the little speaker on the wire that hangs from your ear, making you hold the cord up to your mouth so people can hear you........STOP.  This will beat it all day everyday."
I have been wanting a longer iPhone cord and this one works! I have been using it for a few months and it still works fine. Love the added length so it will now reach from the plug to the table.
So far I love this cute case! It looks so good on my space gray iPhone 6 plus.
Good so far
this works great. leaves no marks on my phone at all. its very easy to apply and left no bubbles! thank you for making this a review product! i love it
works great and love the second usb port. no problems with it yet and i have used it everyday since i purchased it. (4+ months)
Love this case.. Great colors and protection!! Have dropped phone twice in this case No Problem.. 😍
Don't settle for a cheap charger.  This one will charge quickly and reliably.  It's a little difficult to remove but you won't need to unless you're switching cars all the time.  I was done using chargers that worked for a month.  Spend a little more to get a lot.
really worth of the money.
The gold back part popped off now it's just black rubber. I actually like it better this way. The gold part of case is very thin and scratches easily. It looked old and beat up in just a few weeks.
Fantastic! Fits phone great and looks good!
These things are pretty straightforward. Works just like it should.
Rubber falls apart
Great case
Great product
Nice case
"This case fits perfect and looks awesome but you definitely lose some wifi and data connectivity. I noticed it as a decrease in range, not so much in speed so it may not affect everyone."
"Got the tempered glass, and it is THE BEST!  Goes on so easily using the hinge method, with zero bubbles, and feels like the OEM glass.  As cheap as glass screen protectors have become, there is absolutely NO reason to get any kind of plastic anymore.  Even the best of those are far inferior to tempered glass."
Very good.
"This case is even better than I thought it would be! It's a great price! The case is just like the picture and the color is beautiful. The case fits perfectly, the buttons are easy to press, and the two parts snap together nicely and makes it look like a one whole case. I don't think they will come apart unless you want to take the case off. They are snug together! Where the speaker and charger and headphone plug-ins are, the holes of the case are nicely carved around them all! Including the camera and flash and mute button. If you always have to take your case off to plug your phone to a big speaker (with an audio-in cable), with this case you don't have to! There is enough space to plug in with it! Same with chargers and headphones! As for protection, dropped my phone a few times and it is ok! This is a great buy, I do recommend this one!"
Just what I needed
So much better than the clip kind.
"Love it, the color is vibrant. I do wish that the inside color was a different color its very pink. I've had it for a few weeks and so far its holding up great. The cover is nice and snug the material is sturdy and the stitching is tight."
They are wonderful. I use them to exercise. I sweat alot and they are working just as good as when I bought them.
Ironically incompatible with 5c home button configuration
A must have if you try and travel
Connect and disconnect  continue
Very well made. Feels premium to the touch and texture. I would buy it again because of how well the craftsmanship is
"Barely fits the Nexus 6 in a &#34;SUPCASE Premium Hybrid Bumper Case&#34;, but managed to get it to hold on. Once it's ready, the VR effects are pretty decent, no cross-talk issues at all.<br /><br />Aside from the Nexus 6 in a case barely fitting, what the cardboard makes you realize is that 1440p is still not high resolution enough as you can easily see pixels on the screen :(<br /><br />Using the headstrap will make your nose feel uncomfortable, rubbing against cardboard (literally); you'll want some kind of gel to pad the nose area."
"Love it!  I already had one in brown and wanted one in blue.  I have had several compliments.  Fast service, too!  Will definitely order again."
I am pleased with my purchase
The phone is a little too heavy for it and after a time it fall out.
It's perfect.
Like it a lot.
I love this case! Ships fast and is very stylish 😻 keeps your phone secure. Isn't bulky feeling or feels like it's too much. Feels very slim and fits the phone perfectly.
Good deal...fast charge works great.  Beats the hell out of cord charging.
"This product works well for the price, I've tried this on my iPhone and my android phone, It took a little getting used to becauseit blocks out sound very well, The battery life is acceptable and I have ran a half marathon with it and had plenty of power left."
The remote works fine but the trunk opening button doesn't work on my model car. Oh well
"A great device. Elegant, faster, good battery life. Recommended as a mid range phone, yes. Absolutely."
Good
Does everything it purports to do.  Very good protection for an expensive GPS unit.
"Came quickly , exceeds expectations"
great
Amazing screen protector. I've had it for over a couple months and still doing the job. Very easy to apply as well
This is a great product. Easy to install and adjusts to fit all sorts of devices. My kids love not having neck ache at the end of long trips now. We have left it installed all summer without any issues.
"wont stay closed, you get what you pay for"
"I love how pretty this case is.  My phone feels protected.  The kick stand seems a little weak, but I can live with that.  Easy to put on & feels good in my hand."
"As waterproof cases go, it does work. I put weight of phone, in coins in pouch with a tissue and dropped in bucket of water. floated and all stayed dry. CAUTION THOUGH: At first I just put in a bunch of coins and didn't weight and it sank, fast. So, be sure to try at least the weight of your phone, if it is heavier than mine, it might not work. Not the easiest to close and open, nothing fast about it, but I can take on boat without worrying about it getting splashed or falling over board. Not easy to take photos with though, so I usually end up taking out of pouch to take photos, which could defeat the purpose of even having it. If you ever attempted photos with your phone in the sun, especially with glare off the water...it is hard to see phone alone, and with the case on it is even harder. I purchased some waterproof camera floats and attached one to the loop on this case for extra safety about sinking. Does't matter how waterproof the case is if it sinks to the bottom of a lake.Despite it being a bit awkward, it still gives piece of mind and that makes it worth it."
Fits and looks great!
"I use this as an auxiliary battery for my iPhone when I'm running Road Bike Pro, which between GPS and Blue Tooth sensors (heart rate, speed, and cadence) can run down the phone's built-in battery pretty quickly.  This extends my usable ride time by hours.  I love the %charged readout!"
Works great so far! Holding a charge well.
Awsome case!! Fits well. Looks great. Durable and appealing.
Have this case on my s6 right now it has a very nice feel great texture not cheaply made! ♡♡ Love it
Delivered fast!  Super easy to install and only got one tiny bubble which came out easily. Can't even tell the film protector is on the phone. No stickiness to it. 5 stars for sure.
"I really like the Silicone rubber texture feel<br /><br />- Keep in mind there are multiple sizes for whatever your need may be<br />- 10 inch size is great for some applications and frustrating for others to keep in mind what you will use this for! Works great for Portable Power Chargers and plugging into Computers or USB Hubs that are on your table or desk<br /><br />- Seems to be easier and is more flexible then some cable<br />- MFi Certified, no error messages, charged my iPhone 5S completely even tested flipping the cable back and forth, worked great<br />- Cable is a thicker, hopefully this is for added protection, but also the ends are thicker and may make it difficult or impossible to plug into slim or special cases"
Excellent fit to the phone.
If it gets hot in your car the suction cup will leave a very sticky residue on your windshield.
Great for traveling without adding bulk!
Great case and very attractive.  Very hard to put on and remove.  Part of the plastic broke trying to take the case off to replace the screen protector
"I bought this for a trip and it broke instantly, I cannot even charge it anymore. This is not a good quality purchase, I would NOT recommend unless you are looking to throw $15 down the drain."
These are the best earbuds on the market.  Best quality.
"buy 2 , one would run a few weeks the wifi and then stopped when I wanted to make a claim had already spent time replacement"
I love the fact that it comes in multiple sizes that you can choose. Great
"Incredibly thin and cheap feeling, the image is awesome but there is NO protection at all. Also let the package air out a few days, the fumes coming off these has got to be toxic."
"Best glass screen protector I've bought for any phone. It does not scratch, visibility is great,  and the glass was very easy to install."
"This is not fit my phone, the screen was completely warped and had a chip in it ."
"These adapters are great! I tried a different set of adapters also and those don't compare to these. These are better quality and a lot easier to install and swap between bands. They make the bands look integrated and apart of the watch as normal watches do. In my opinion these are the best. Note that if you are purchasing the set for a 42mm watch the largest band size to fit is 24mm, and for 38mm watches the largest is 20mm. The design if these make it easy to use with absolutely any band because of the pin size and you are able to use different pins. Other adapters force you to use their set and the connector may be too wide on others.<br /><br />I would recommend"
So far so good! Tested first in my house in a jar filled with water and day after sailing and in the beach.
"In that this item is EXACTLY what I needed and isn't easily available locally......I'm thrilled! (OK, maybe it doesn't take much to thrill me these days....)"
"Very good charger, so good I purchased another one. I have the Galaxy S4 with 7500 zerolemon battery and charger works flawlessly."
Gets the job done.
Feature rich GPS what more is there to say?  Reliable and gets you where you need to go.
Great case. Would definitely buy again from this seller.
"Wonderful right out of store packaging, great quality and overall best brand out there"
It's perfect! Fits my phone perfectly. The color is so pretty! I get compliments all the time
Great charger for my LG G4 from the trusted brand Anker . I bought it as my workplace charger and it serves the purpose well. Green LED indicates Quick Charge while the blue indicates normal charging. I only wish the prongs would collapse into the body and gave the unit smaller footprint.
Nice looking watch but i couldn't get texts or emails on watch.
Thx
Great.
"Cards cannot go in slot ,too small.  When phone is inside,  item will not close .  Material is good it is design that is problem.  Wireless charging still works."
excellent! Thank you
"Love it. Easy to apply and i didn't face any problems with it. I loved the it came with it tow small wipes to clean your screen before apply it, one is dry and one is wit."
Everything I expected
"I was very disappointed in this.  It is very cheap looking.  I assumed this was like a statue when comparing it to the other similar products for sale, but it is actually a piece of plastic.  The man is hollow.  If you look closely at the picture you can see the arm and leg lines.  It is hard to explain.  It you want something rudimentary and basic, this will work.  If you are looking for a classy way to store your phone, keep looking."
Great quality. Very easy to install.
pretty good
Works great.. The app i have on my phone lets me see what is going  on with my truck real time.
"I love these belt pouches. I had one for my iPhone 4s, and couldn't live without it when I got my iPhone 6. I found that this 6-Plus pouch works perfectly for the iPhone 6 inside an Otterbox Defender. (The one for the i-phone 6 was too tight, contrary to reviews and answered questions there.) I like the way you can slip a belt through the loops, and also hook it on the waistband of your pants. I bought several of them, to facilitate switching between pants from day to day. By the way, I would think that the iPhone 6-Plus inside an Otterbox Defender would NOT fit in this pouch."
"I got a pair of these and I must say I totally regret it!  First of all these headphones seem a knock-off of the Air-Fi® Matrix2 AF62:  [[ASIN:B00DOP3NPW MEE audio Air-Fi Matrix2 Bluetooth Wireless + Wired High Fidelity Headphones with Headset and aptX, AAC, and NFC Support]]  I asked both company's staff about this. MEEaudio store staff alleged &#34;the Ausdom M05 are a knock-off of the Air-Fi® Matrix2 AF62&#34;. On the other hand, very later on Ausdom staff replied to me stating that they &#34;manufactured the Air-Fi® Matrix2 AF62 for Meelectronics&#34; (now MEEaudio). So definitely there is something weird going on here... MEEaudio is an electronics company established in City of Industry, California since 2005. Ausdom is a Chinese factory based in Southern China.  Ausdom M05 is a product that cannot be verified as genuine for which you'll pay pretty much the same as for getting a pair of original headphones. Imagine you buy something that is not mainstream but is not that cheap either, so it is not a big brand but at least you are happy to say it is an original product and not a knock-off of a known brand, but then you realize It is a non-genuine product... wouldn't you feel really disappointed?  Secondly if you are looking for a comfortable headset you better go look somewhere else since I am not being able to keep them on for more than 10 minutes. Even though my ears are quite small they feel unpleasantly tight and the earpads harm your ear cartilages. Comfort is a essential when talking about a headset.  With respect to the sound they are too bassy and voices are really really low as if they are distant. Also you will easily notice a high latency. I was concerned about aptx compatibility, since most devices with Bluetooth transmitters such as laptops or TVs do not support this technology yet, so I emailed them to enquire about compatible aptx dongles. Based on their replies they don't even seem to know their product. One of the things they told me in theircontradictory argument and in broken English is that there are no aptx devices whose Bluetooth version is less than 4.0, when clearly there are both transmitters and headphones with lower Bluetooth versions that support aptx. An examples of this is the Aukey Wireless Bluetooth Audio Transmitter BT-C3 with Bluetooth version 2.1:  [[ASIN:B00PI62YVO Aukey Wireless Bluetooth Audio Transmitter Portable Bluetooth Stereo Music Adapter Dongle with A2DP and aptX Low Latency Technology (BT-C1, Black)]]  So they haven't been able to recommend me an appropriate dongle to use the headphone's aptx feature.  The microphone is quite bad and you cannot configure it to work with the headset in &#34;headphones mode&#34;. It will rather work as a hands-free device and the quality of the audio decreases greatly. Not to mention that it's a nightmare to configure the mic on Windows.  Honestly if you are willing to spend this amount, there are better original headsets out there around this price. Hopefully I will not make the same mistake twice."
Berry good
"Well, after using this for a short time, I thought I liked it, but as it turns out, the case gets quite hot (only when when I had the case charging, not connected to an external charger), and it has caused the battery to swell up, lifting the screen off of the phone.  I would include a picture, but it's difficult to take a pic of your phone when it's your only camera.  Now I have to spend about $50 to get the battery replaced.  That's what I get for trying to save some money and not buying a brand I know and trust."
back part snapped off
perfect fit and build quality.  shows off the beauty of a great phone.
Can't hold weight of Samsung Note 4
Beautiful case I ordered as a gift. Beautiful color. Would definitely buy from seller again.
I didn't have any problems the case fit my phone perfectly. Shipping didn't take long at all. It does a great job protecting my phone. I recommend this product.
Much nicer and solid that any other case I've used. Provides excellent protection
Works great on my iPad that my kids use everytime I put it down. I feel it is protected.
I just received it and haven't used it yet.  The bluetooth paired and works.  The design is great.  The phone fits really snug.  It appears that it will work well.  It is nice quality.
"Great case, like it!"
Great case! Very nice.
it took forever to get them. would not have ordered them if i knew they were from China. While waiting I bought 3 other ones with the mesh tip. i love these ! Will use the other ones as back-up ! At a $1.52 for ten it was a bargain. Too exspensive to send back all the way to China !
Great item
This is the best phone case I have ever owned! Plus I love the haunted mansion so it looks cool. I've had it on my phone since Fall 2013.
"Really nice to have around.  Charges phone quickly and lasts a long time.  Does take some time to charge,  but totally worth it."
Very impressed! I received this from a giveaway. Easy to install and very pleased with the quality. Will definitely purchase the next one. Thank you!
"I wanted a water resistant because I work for the local school and the raining  season is about to start.  This looks and feels good and is easy to put on.  It also allows wireless charging which is nice because I got the charger free with the phone.  Though I wish the instructions were for this phone,because watching  the instructions for an iPhone 6 for a Samsung note is strange.<br /><br />Edit:Sombody asked about the stylus access so i uploded some pictures."
"Managed to replace the battery with tools provided.  But, new battery is not nearly as good as original equipment.  The new battery provided approximately the same life as the original worn out 2 year old battery that I was replacing.  Bottom line: if you are replacing your battery so your phone has the same life it had when it was new, this battery will not do that."
Provides good protection and space to tuck in money or a credit card!
Extremely cheap cover. Not worth the price. The art work/graphic is blurry and a bit off centered.
Love the price for a great product
This unit is more powerful  than most others for its weight and size.  A great deal.
"Great case, great price. Very happy with it!"
It's working great (after you figure how to connect with the phone).
It just came in a nice bubble wrap and looks and feels great. Fits my phone perfectly. Favorite phone case I ever had!
Great item.
Excellent
Fits great! Love the color!
This smart watch worths its money. It makes the same things the other famous watches do. You can connect it via bluetooth with your mobile. It connected without a problem with s4. Receive and make calls.
just the right size
"We have a bazillion cords all over out countertop and this has wrangled them somewhat....we still have all the cords, but now I no longer have to switch them out after charging bc they can all plug into this on base. I've had NO problems of overheating like some people mentioned, and I keep this plugged in ALL the time."
"My wife and I both had Lumia 1020's, unfortunately a friend dropped hers and broke it. I gave her mine and bought this... to this day I still can't comprehend how it only cost me $40. It's obviously not a high end phone, but for the price... it absolutely cannot be beaten."
The speakers did not sound as well as I thought they would because they were jbls. The highs could be a little bit more crispier sounding.
Purchased three for my kids.
"Amazing sound - not very comfortable, I'm not used to these type of earphones so I'm going to have to give it more time. The sound is awesome! Super deep bass, earphones itself feels sturdy. Not a big fan of long cord going around the back of my neck, using the cord holder makes it even more uncomfortable (it tugs the earphones back) and not using it makes the left earphones cable jump forward. I ran for an hour and a half (on a treadmill) the first day I got it and went to work, charged it for about 2-3 hours and got about 4 hours of use, I hear you can get up to 6-8 continuous hours use out of it - overall I'm very happy with the earphones and price."
Product does not work.
Terrible quality
100% recomendado
"Easy to install, fits fine"
🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌!💃😘😘
I brought this for my iPhone 6 plus because of the case not allowing my headphones to attach to the port. The connection is poor and goes in and out and does not allow the heads its total functionality such as answering the phone from the option on the headphones. It also does not function at all when I connect it to the radio converter in my car.
Great sound and beats my other cassette adapter. I like that the cord is stretchable instead of a straight cord because it takes up less space and doesn't get hooked up in things.
broke within a few days. trying to get refunded
Great phone case.  Keeps my phone safe from scratches and such.<br />Always getting comments on the cute white dots on red pattern!
The case was very fitting heavy duty but loved it it has protected my phone after several drops I think it'll be lasting a pretty long time and the color is so it's so easy to find well in your purse
haven't used it in water but my note 4 fits inside and I like the arm band and the lanyard
"Doesn't fit exactly as it should. It sits just a little to far from the edges for my taste. My past tempered glass protectors were much less noticeable, but you can't look at this phone without seeing the protector.<br />In order for it to not hit the home button, it has to touch the front camera. It doesn't interfere with the camera, but it looks bad.<br />Plus it shows a terrible looking line of what i assume to be adhesive all the way around the edge that you cant miss."
You will have to press buttons harder due to the screen interfering with screen sensitivity. Great screen protector overall. I would definitely recommend.
"Great fit and easy to put on. No bubbles. Depending on your case, it corners may push up a bit."
fit perfect
Very sturdy and duable. Satisfied with this product.
"Great seller but the quality of this ACEPower Cord leaves much to be desired. Have had it for 2 1/2 months and it finally stopped charging. Have been using it on my iPad since mid June. It worked well at the start although it was a bit difficult to fit into the charging area. It was almost as if the pin connector was a little too wide. After a couple weeks it started to fit easier but then the rubber coating over the wires broke where it meets the pin connector. Since July, it intermittently would not charge when plugged in. It finally gave out today. I've tried running Hard Resets, using other Power Adapters, and 30 Pin to USB cords and have found this ACEPower Cord to be at fault. My electronics are always well taken care of too. The only good feature is the length...it's 10 feet long. You may want to avoid the hastle and cost of purchasing this inferior product only to have to spend more on a better quality Apple product. I learned my lesson."
Tech Armor screen covers are outstanding.  Easy to install and no bubbles.  I would strongly suggest giving this product a try!!!
"This is a nice temper glass screen protector. It does feel a bit cheap, but it has definitely protected my phone when it fell. It still has not cracked after all these times I have dropped my phone. Definitely a good tempered glass."
Broke down within a few weeks of use. The product needs to be sturdier under everyday normal usage.
I love this ipod cover.  It snaps shut and fits perfectly. It is small and secure.
"This is a great charger….does the job in good speed, does not get hot and charges 4 devices as advertised.  Glad I purchased!"
"I bought this for the reviews and they are accurate. It is a sturdy cable, thicker than the apple that came with my phone. The connectors look like they will last a while."
"Love the case, exactly how described"
One of the upper corners does not snap tight.
"The Shower mate works well inside and out of the shower. Its very loud in the shower and the sound quality is better than a phone, but not quite as good as a stereo bluetooth speaker. The suction cup is strong, and sticks to many surfaces except except drywall and my cat. The connectivity range is incredible, lasting up to 110 feet outside. Battery life is about 6 hours playback, and recharges in 2. My only concern is the charging cable is not a standard micro USB, so don't lose it! Some people have reported not being able to change the volume or turn it off, but I didnt have this problem, the buttons are multifunctional.<br /><br />▌ SOUND QUALITY ▌<br />It gets more than loud enough in the shower because in there it is amplified, and actually hurts to have it maxed out. I found about 3/4 volume was good.<br />Sound quality is ok. There is moderate distortion above 3/4 volume, particularly in the bass-mids.<br />Using a tone generator, I can get whisper quiet bass as low as 40hz, but in music it's only relevant above 75hz. There is not much bass below 100hz as you should expect from this size of speaker. Deep basslines are barely there, but standard electronic basslines, and acoustic guitars are fine.<br />The mids, highs, and vocals sound good, except in the shower vocals become a little distorted from the echo off the walls. I found puting the speaker in the middle of a wall was better than in the corner.<br />It's fine for music outside the shower to, probably even more so. All that being said, the audio and frequency range is still better than from a phone, tablet, or small notebook, but not quiet as good as a standard portable stereo bluetooth speaker. It is still enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />Call quality is fine, but nothing special. I can clearly hear other people, and they can hear me, but my voice is a bit distorted if I talk to loud or close to the mic (tested with recording on computer). It's not like a phone mic where you need to be close, it picks up voice from a few feet away, but at the same time it does a decent job of dampening the shower noise.<br /><br />▌ BUILD / DESIGN ▌<br />The rounded shape is easy to hold in hand. It's made out of plastic with a rubber texture. The buttons are soft silicone and have a clicky feedback. They are positioned far enough apart and have a bit of mushy space between them so I know which one I'm touching without looking. The suction cup is strong and hasnt fallen off, but it is also easy to pull off and reposition if desired, and sticks to many surfaces. It also floats in water. I opened it up and it is sealed with a rubber O-ring.<br /><br />▌ FUNCTION & CONNECTIVITY ▌<br />The speaker has several controls such as Power, Skip back / Volume down, Skip foreward / Volume up, Pause / Play, and Call / Reject / Redial. So there is no need to be near the phone once you have the playlist or app setup. It also can skip stations on internet radio apps. The only thing I didnt like about the controls was how slow it is to change the volume, it is not changed in increments, you must hold down the button to gradually change it and it takes 13 seconds to go from 0-100%. Not a big deal, but annoying if something plays to loud and you need to turn it down fast.<br /><br />The connectivity remained up to 110ft outside, and was fine anywhere in my house.<br /><br />Battery life lasts 6 hours, and recharges in about 2 hours. It's a 400mAh 3.7V battery. The charging cable is sadly not micro USB, and isnt like any other cable I have, it's like a tiny version of a 3.5mm audio hack, so I would be worried about losing it.<br /><br />There is an LED under the rubber that shines through and show different statuses. It flashes blue ever few seconds so you know it's on. It flashes pink and blue when turning it off. While charging it is solid red, and shuts off when finished.<br /><br />▌ CONCLUSION ▌<br />The showermate is a nice speaker, even outside the shower (maybe even more so). It is more than loud enough and the mic picks up voice from a few feet away. It has a couple minor annoyances like the slow volume change and non-micro USB cable, but overall is good for the price. I give it 4.5 stars because of the uncommon charging cable.

I use my Jaybird x BlueBuds Sports Headphones during cardio training in the gym.  I used these headphones for about a year with no problems. I do put these headphones thru the sweat ringer and they sound great!!!
"I love the 10 foot cable, 😄"
Good
"Too tight, very hard to put the cellphone in that cover."
I wonder what phone actually fits in-between the steering wheel mines didn't (iphone 6/ Mazda 2)
muy bien
Excellent product
Excellent.
Thank you!!! :-D
Great product! Just as described.
"Strong magnet, simple to use. Material made of metal and plastic, well made overall."
I really like this. It reminds me of the Outer Box but at a lower cost. The only thing I wish they had would be the plastic guard for screen.
"[iOS] Right out of the packaging the Bluetooth connection was efficient and easy.  Works exactly as advertised when using the iOS camera app, without any additional apps needed.  You press the button and it fires the shutter.  I've taken a few dozen shots with no glitches.  It doesn't trigger my Camera+ app however, although I haven't installed any CamKix apps to bridge that process.  Durability of the fob is probably adequate, but it's not something I'd want to drop too many times or step on."
My bf love it
"Everything fit perfectly.  Sturdy case.  The stylus is not telescopic (doesn't stretch out) and the little cord on the attachment is short so you have to detach it to use it but that is not a problem for me.  Also, the stylus tip is very soft, &#34;squishy,&#34; and hollow rather than solid.  Also not a problem for me, though.  Other reviews have mentioned paint wearing off.  I have noticed that happening a little bit along the edges but I figure, for the price, it doesn't bother me.  And it looks like it will be clear if/when the pain does wear off, and I'm okay with clear.<br />Overall, great product for a great price.  Arrive faster than expected and fit perfectly."
Works well
I've had this case a little over a month and the most important part of the phone case broke off. I noticed it while I was trying to get my card out. One of the notches that keeps the flap closed is broken.. Very disappointed I loved everything about this case until that happened. Also sad that the case gets &#34;stained&#34; by jeans...
If you have an Apple Watch you know how annoying it can be to charge it without being held up by something. This stand solves the problem perfectly and looks really nice. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who owns an apples watch!
It is very good and it came fast. So glad!
"Luv this case,  arrived quickly & fit my note 4 perfectly"
The case looks and feels really good. The only reason this isn't a five start review is because the kickstand feels a little cheap.
Works well.  Item exactly as expected.
Perfect
great except how long it took
"I bought this USB cable because I needed to be able to distinguish it from all the other USB  cords that I have, and it certainly does that.  It  works really well, arrived on time and packaged well. All in all,  I'm well please."
"So affordable, fits the screen perfectly, and came with instructions that made it SO easy to install perfectly. 10/10 would buy again."
works as it is supposed to
I love it
Really liked the size of the cover and how smooth it is. Also love the bit of bright green that doesn't seem overwhelming but fit right in to my other bright green stuff . Also protects the screen well
Disappointed in the phone
Love this case. It is made well. I've had it on my iPhone 5C for a long time. I have dropped it several times and it is protected and not broken yet.
Very easy to install
Good quality and works very well. Doesn't get hot like my Samsung does. Delivered in excellent condition on as promised.
great performace for the price !!
"If u need a better one,  don't go for this"
Had this armband for less than two months and the right seam split apart the whole way and my ipod fell out while I was cutting grass. Would like manufacturer feedback on replacement.
Got what I paid for. Super cheap. Broke within days.
I love it... totally cute and so much fun!  :0)
Great phone case. Was delivered promptly
"Gets stuck to the screen, and the silence switch breaks off. It is also a pain in the butt  to get it off, DON'T BUY IT."
You want this. trust me.
"Work for a couple days, maybe a month if lucky then stops."
"Great price, looked like it would be awesome protection in the water. Unfortunately it went missing before I was able to actually use the product 😥"
Picture resolution is awesome.
"Bought 4 of these, they work great, provides plenty of power for dual devices."
"This is not Amolded so don't expect this glass to stand up to the came torture your original could. The kit is comprehensive but I suggest using a blowdrier or heat gun before separating the screen from the glue over the LCD.  These tools work but weren't able to separate the glass from the glue on my phone. Mine does say Samsung in the glass, and looks like the original. Just know the glass is not as resilient."
"Nice unit. Sound is kinda muffled, not very crisp. My biggest complaint is the short battery life. 4-5 hours max. Sure to get shorter as unit ages."
This unit returned. The signal strength at my home is not strong enough to overcome the cable loss from antenna to amplifier.  I think it would work fine if one had at least one bar on phone.  The unit was received in good contion and timely as promised by sellar.
"If you're like me and take great care of your product, you will love this case. It's thin and minimal and adds some design but doesn't overtake the beauty of the phone. Not meant or made for someone who drops their phones all the time. I've had the same case for my iPhone 5s and now I love it even more on my iPhone 6."
It never stayed more than30 seconds on my phone.  The case was never used because of that.  And the others that I purchased did the same.
Doesn't work. It does not charge my HTC cell phone. Had to get another cable. Not worth bothering to return.
Great item and fast shipping
Video Review<br /><br />https://youtu.be/czpJMiKOveE
Love this:)
"Really good adapter. I've been using it for a few months without any issue. I noticed it works perfectly with my original Samsung cable, charges as fast as in a reagular plug. I honestly haven't try it with any other cable since I haven't had the need. Will update when I do."
my son rocks with this case all the time
This case has saved me from a shattered screen more times than I care to admit. I get lots of complements on the design too.
The sides get dirty relatively quick and hard to clean
Too small of wire
"At first glance these look like high quality, sturdy cables.  Maybe the wire part even is, but the micro connectors let them down. Of 3, 1 didn't work straight away, 1 broke the tip off after 1 weeks use, and 1 only charges if you &#34;jiggle&#34; it right."
I t works as ecpected.  It is larger than I thought.  It size is similar to my galaxy phone so it is awkward to carry around but will give a couple of charges to the phone.
Great case and price.  Arrived quickly.
Love the pens my husband sticks one in his shirt for coviinence it's there when ever he needs it .
Good stuff! That case literally fits in with any phones.
"I like that this wall charger has the ability to charge 2 different devices at the same time. It does seem to deliver a quicker charge than the older wall chargers I already own. I've used it to charge my iPad 3 and iPhone 6 without getting any type of error message which is the case lately with the non-Apple charging devices I already own. If you don't use both USB ports, you can see a blue glowing light coming from the one that's not in use. But it's not bright or annoying. I would recommend the iClever wall charger. I think it's a good value for the price."
Not bad but not real rugged
"Love the design but it is off a little, doesn't &#34;hold&#34; the apple right. Also doesn't seem to fit the iPhone 6 correctly. Offers no protection, cover came off and phone broke after three days."
"Very nice case , good quality , Looks exactly like the picture , and fits my galaxy s6 edge plus perfectly 😍"
nice new item and fast shipping
Wonderful :)
works awesome
"Great USB power.  Charges all my tablets at once, quickly too."
Great case. It's slim and doesn't add bulk like other cases I've tried. The only bad thing is the clear silicone edge has discolored to a orange color and can't be cleaned (I've had it 9 months now) . I've experienced this same phenomenon with another clear case form a different brand. I'm just assuming that clear silicone isn't the best if you want a truly clear case. I just ordered the same case from i blason except with the black silicone egde so I can still showcase my white phone but now have to worry about the egdes discoloring.
"The product work great, glad I bought this product"
Love it.  Fits my s5 perfectly along with putting other things inside of it.  Very versatile and I loved wearing it.
"Great case!  It's slick looking, easy to put on, has padding on corners, and little tiny &#34;feet&#34; on back to keep it from sliding off slippery surfaces.  Kind of wish it came in other colors than it did (and there were several to choose from), but I just didn't care for those shades.  But I definitely liked the silver.  Sold and happy!"
charges all my devices and is small for the capacities
the magnetic closure has a small magnet so it doesn´t close properly most of the times.
"It fit just fine but the plastic is hard and not really absorbent for impacts and made a tough fight to get it on the phone, ended up throwing it away after never using it and loosing the phone it was meant for into a lake."
"Works great. On a full charge, it'll charge about 3 to 4 phones. Charging it up from a dead battery to full battery takes a bit, quicker than what I would have expected for 10,000. It's a great device, quality is nice has a really nice feel to it. I use it mainly for concerts/festivals and when I go camping or somewhere I don't have an outlet. I recommend it to anybody needing a portable battery great price too"
Great product at a Great price.
"Didn't really stick, I never sent it back like I should have."
Very disappointed
"works across any phone which supports the shutter function with a volume button.<br />Apple, Xiaomi and Samsung worked flawlessly.<br />nice sleek and classy design, no cheesy colors.<br /><br />minor gripe about the swivel holding the camera as it felt loose...<br />but nothing some epoxy didn't fix.<br />great value for the price and with a free gift too, thanks!!"
So far I've had it for 5 days and it's still the same!
very good
Awesome
Perfect case !!!!!!!!!
Excellent charger for the price and great length
Always buy these ones they sound good
The product works extremely well. They were very inexpensive but took a long time to deliver. I would have paid more to deliver faster.
Good Price
"The LEVIN Waterproof case is exactly as depicted in the photos and described in the sales promo. It is sturdy, made of ultralight hard PC plastic and Glass Screen Protector that works flawlessly with iPhone 6 Touch ID. The case weighs 1.64 oz/ 47.5 grams and is 0.4&#34;/12mm thick. The granular surface is slip-proof. All ports, buttons and controls align perfectly and are accessible. Package contains the case, an audio extension cable, a microfiber tissue and user manual. Setup is easy and intuitive.<br /><br />I tested the case by placing tissue paper inside it and fully immersed it overnight in a sink full of water. The results confirmed that the LEVIN case is indeed waterproof, there were no leaks, and all tissue contents were dry.<br />Charger port only fits the original Apple jack. The audio port requires an extension (provided).<br />With the phone inside the case, sound quality is excellent. No damping or muffling.<br /><br />I took my iPhone 6 (inside the case) with me on a boat ride this weekend and, for the first time, did not need to put it in a cumbersome plastic locking &#34;waterproof &#34; through which one cannot dial, answer a call or take a picture - all of which I was able to do easily with the LEVIN Waterproof case.<br />I really like it and shall keep my phone well protected inside this case.<br /><br />I received a coupon to purchase this item, but with no obligation to write a review. This is not a barter deal. I have no financial or personal connection with the manufacturer, seller or their employees."
"Good price for a good quality case. It took a few weeks to arrive, but otherwise no complaints"
Love them
Its barely even noticeable and its pretty thick.
great slim case.
great sound quality; hold a charge;  not the most comfortable ear piece.
loved it
"This ruined the battery of my phone, it overheated and I can no longer use my phone. I would give it zero stars."
"Product is not as resilient as the OEM. Perfect install, then placed into my brothers pocket the morning he went to work, sat down in his car, heard a slight crack looked at his phone... Cracked!!! He bought his G2 new when it came oh so long ago... Oh well, what can you do."
Great amp great transaction
This was a birthday gift for my teenage niece. She loves it!
great one i like it
This is a very functional phone cover. I love the flip cover function of it for protecting your screen. I live the simple white cover to it and that the back is clear showing through it the phone itself. The phone stays put in place nicely The port cutout in the bottom is almost the entire length of the phone so you don't have to worry about chargers not fitting into it while your phone cover is on. I will be using this case for going out to make sure my phone is protected while in my wristlets as it gets hit against things and I like the extra protecting for my screen. I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. That in no way swayed my opinion of this product.
It works but the sound quality is incredibly poor.
Great
nice
Bought this and it does not fit my lg stylo phone so not liking that at all. If they companies dont test these on the phones first why sell them waste of time and money
Very easy to get dirty. Not sturdy. Don't recommend.
"It did the job while I used it. The only issue is that my house key falls out if I adjust it while running. Also, if I go for longer runs, I get a rash from the sweat salt grinding under it. I switched to a FlipBelt, but that is just my preference. Feels good to have my arm free of it. I guess it would be perfect for you if you were just going on a walk or some activity where you didn't sweat."
"I bought three sound pods in the kickstarted campaing. I love them very much! The sound they produce is amazing. I use an IPhone 6+, but have also used other phones in it. They come very handy when one desperetly wants to hear music! I take them to camping because they don't use energy; I'm using two, I keep one in the bathroom and one in the kitchen and use them everyday. Totally worth it."
"Had to send back as didn't fit my phone completely, but nicely made."
yes
Very nice protective case for I phone 6 plus. I dropped my phone 2 times and no damage. Easy to put on looks nice and not bulky. I like!!!
"I love it. I've been using it since the day I got it. It fits well on my ear and has a spare of ear strap for those who has small ear. Quality of sounds, the easy setup, is what I needed"
eats up battery life.
Works great in my 2011 Ford Ranger. Dual 2.4amp USB for charging any cell phone! Works great!
First off I'm huge on boxing and I love how the item is boxed. The sound is crystal clear which makes it hard to differentiate from a cd. I don't see why people rate it any lower than 4 stars. Just an FYI you DO have to have a stereo head with an aux input built in for the device to work. One thing that I forgot to mention was you can charge to of your devices at the same time which is awesome.
"This charger does not work!  In fact, it reverses the charge already on the Kindle."
Very happy with this purchase. Thank You!
This is a very sturdy case for the iPhone 6.  It comes in 2 pieces...a black rubber case and then a pink (or whatever color you choose) plastic cover.  The case has port covers for the charging port and the silent button which will keep sand/crumbs/etc. out of the ports. I really like it.
"A definite buy if you're looking for inexpensive, reliable, good-sounding bluetooth headphones.<br /><br />I previously used the Beats in-ear headphones during my workouts. I wanted a set of bluetooth headphones to avoid having to worry about the cord in between my iPhone and headphones. These headphones fit the bill perfectly. They obviously don't sound as good as the expensive Beats ones, but they are good enough for workouts. They do a terrific job of isolating noise, so I don't recommend them for running outside. Inside, like the gym or on a treadmill, they are perfect for isolating you from the rest of the world. I have no problem with them staying in my ear while running or lifting weights. The key is to try the included, different sized-earpieces to get the best fit. Battery life is good, they last about 3-4 hrs; I only keep them powered while working out.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes."
One of the best phone cases I've ever had it is sturdy and holds up pretty good when dropped.
Used for my Garmin Fish Finder.  Holds a charge for up to a year.  (that is with out using the Fish Finder)
"I couldn't be happier with this case. It is very sturdy and I'm always getting compliments on it. I'm able to keep my license, 2 credit cards and a couple of dollars in it. Now I don't have to carry my purse everywhere."
Thank you
if you have the newer phones these are a must have. Aftermarket chargers don't work
Love it!
This subwoofer works very well. It sounds amazing. My Vette now is rocking!!!!<br />Excellent customer service and fast shipping!!!!
"Absolutely amazing value. I used to be a big fan of Klipsch, having owned two pairs of S4i and one pair of Ri6s and the Brainwavs Delta easily matches up in terms of sound quality even at half the price. The seal and noise isolation isn't quite as good, but is still very on point. The wire noise is minimal, the wire is light and not intrusive, and with the foam eartips that are included, these can be comfortably worn for hours. I love using these while I work out because they're so light. Furthermore, the one year hassle free warranty makes this hands down one of my favorite earbuds I've ever owned."
"Not really for a note 4. You can jam it in there, but it is made for a smaller phone. Cheap quality. Got what I paid for."
The only device that was able to hold properly my Nokia Lumia Icon phone.
Great design and very sturdy!  Love the colors too!  The price is wonderful for five cables!
"The unit is made very nice and sturdy, but if you have steeply angled air vents (such as the ones on a 2014 Hyundai Tucson), it's not practical to use.  Only recommend for air vents that have a more vertical orientation."
"I love the case, HOWEVER, I purchased the teal case & when I take pictures with the flash my picture turn out greenish."
Pictures are blurry.
"Hard to say if it helps or not, I think I have slightly better reception. For the price you cant really go wrong."
Very nice.
As advertised. Love the look and doesn't add any weight. Looks even better with one of their back cover skins.
good
I wish you would hold the battery a lot longer but it does give you the strength that you need
Excellent.
This product deserves the five star rating.
"looks great, only slight problem is a few times the detectors actually slides off the holder."
Fits the phone very well. Highly recommended!
"did not like them, every time I plugged it into my nav system a message came across that it was not charging so I sent them back"
"It is a good quality case, but i expected the bumper part to be solid white. However it is a semi transparent, matte white. I still like the case enough for it not to be a big complaint. It is sturdy and very thin, and feels nice in the hand. All the ports and buttons are easily accessible as well."
"Works well. Viewing angle could be better...  but for the cost, great monitor!"
The Infinim is the second pair of LG Tones I've owned. I was super excited about the new design and Harman Kardon sound experience. I am so disappointed. My original tones sound way better with a richer and louder sound. I have to keep these and my device turned almost all the way up to hear music decently. I have tried adjusting the audio settings with no resolve. These are basically good for calls only. In no way are these worth the price tag. You are paying for the cool look and the retractable cord option only on these.
Good product.  Works great with my NOTE 3.  Nice to not have to fight the low battery issue all of the time.
"At the beginning I faced an issue with it, later on I just made a simple restart to the beacon itself and now it's working fine and I tested it many times ... Only one reason for the missing star that the mobile app needs more features.  I recommend this :)"
Works perfectly... Thanks 😁
perfect
battery is working great
No appreciable increase in signal strength
I am really starting to like the Caseguru cases. This one is no different. This is a new way to add a credit card holder to a phone case and I like this format. The card is tucked in and protected and I think it is harder for people to realize there is a card in there which could be good. This is a nice protective case. The case also fits nice with the &#34;edge&#34; feature on my phone. Looking for a good fit on the edges is something I really watch for on cases now.<br /><br />Note: I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
Just an amazing deal for screen protectors.  Admittedly they're not super quality so they get scratched up pretty easily but they're so cheap that you can just put on a new one every few weeks/months and it still costs just about nothing.
Just what I was looking for.
"Best lightning cable out there, This has traveled constantly over the last 13 months, still works perfectly.  I would call this super heavy duty."
"Simple, convenient, inexpensive and best of all it works. This is a no brained for anyone fishing along the coast"
"Love it, It's work with Galaxy note 5. It say fast charging when you plug it in. It take about 1 and a half hour to fill it to up from 5-100%. But it dose not work with my Sony z3."
just as ordered but they forgot the ties ? but still its a great case to keep all those travel cable well organized
"Wonderful cover. Absolutely the thinnest cover that I've ever seen, and I have been receiving great comments from other people about it as well. I really wanted a minimalistic cover for my iPhone, and no doubt this fills the bill."
"Came way before the expected delivery date, it's amazing quality, and very cute!!"
"Awesome product, like always I've come to expect from iCarez team.  Get this Glass, you Won't be disappointed!! :)"
I'm very satisfied.
Fit perfectly
Fast shipping. Great price. Good power. Nice crossover.
"Sorry, does not work as good as the regular, 1 year old used, one I had before. I had it switched over at a Verizon store and charged it carefully. I still have to charge it daily, even with minimum (1 or 2 short calls) daily usage."
works good
Phone has to be at least two feet with in it to work
Arrived with 2-day free shipping as promised.  Inserted my Cricket SIM and I was up and running in 5 minutes.  Nice size sharp 7&#34; clear screen.  Movies and videos are crisp.  Great value.  BLU products are changing the marketplace with quality low-cost competitive products.  I am normally a Samsung customer but BLU is starting to change that.
"This is absolutely perfect and what I was looking for. It attaches to the vent, I hook my phone on it and can move it any direction I need. LOVE LOVE LOve it"
"Love the length, the durability is poor. Unless you treat your charger as an infant then go somewhere else."
What you are looking for
"Good case, took forever to get it delivered but great for the iPhone 5c because it allows you to see the color on the back of the phone. Does not interfere with use of the phone. Great buy for the price if you have the patience to wait for it."
Nice case. Good material. Phone still retains a good feel. It also comes with a screen protector so the phone feels like it is shielded well.
Very Good charge love it.<br />I will buy from this company again<br /><br />Thank you Q vigo Trading Company.<br />Keep up the Good Work.
This battery lasted a day. I was very disappointed. I would have returned it but my husband threw out the paperwork.
I bought one and was pleased with the product quality. I just ordered two more for other family members.
"Got this to cover a tablet we bought for my nephew and it works great. He is autistic and doesn't usually like these things on but he has no problem with it, he actually likes it."
This product has helped in my travels across Europe not only did it charge my iPhone 6+ rather quickly (30/40 mins from 10% charge).
Workes greatly
This is the highest quality screen I've ever gotten. Works and looks great and doesn't feel cheap like other screens I've purchased in the past. Well worth the price.
"Purchased as replacement for a cracked case, perfect fit, and nice to swap colors occasionally."
"It does what it's suppose to, but needs to be replaced in no time because all the little jewel thingy's fall off easily."
"I was hesitant to order this case due to the multiple layers in the photos.  Because of the bending issue, I wanted a solid case for my iphone 6 plus. I also needed a holster case. With this phone, I don't think anyone has pockets big enough... Delivered on time as promised with Prime.  The stylus is a nice extra but not really needed or used on my part. I have had no problems getting the case in and out of the holster and I also have a screen protector on as well.  The corners are all protected and there is a lip which provides protection for the screen.  All buttons work well and all ports are accessible.  No problems with charging or camera /photos. Excellent value for this purchase.  Would buy again and am thinking of buying an extra because the holster clips eventually break at some point."
Product arrived as advertised and I love it.  Deliver was as promised.
installing this thing was easy first time i ever installed a car stereo...Bluetooth is awesome you don't have to reconnect every time you turn on the car it automatically connects to your phone so just hit the play button and it will start playing the music that you have on your phone....if you want to use the hands free calling you might wanna hook up the mic that comes with it otherwise the people on the other end of the call  will not hear you.....in my situation i wasn't able to speak through my phone while it was Bluetooth to the stereo...the touch screen is pretty responsive so that's good.......oh and i installed this in my 2006 Nissan Altima and did not need to buy a antenna  you can still use the factory antenna
"It was a vastly different color of gold than what was pictured- more of a dark yellow, almost like if you mixed copper and gold. It arrived after a very long wait, and when I recieved it the case was already broken to the extent that it would not even stay on the phone. Save the dollar you'd waste on this and just get a cheap case at WalMart- at least then you can actually use what you bought."
Great
I've bought other &#34;lightning&#34; cables in the past...but these are the real deal!  Can't get over how fast it charges my phone!  Cable quality and the 10' length are fantastic.
Excellent product! Love it😄
"Seems abit cheap, hard plastic, tight fit. But it does what it was made for, is handy and certainly protects your phone."
"Being able to replace the tips on this vety good stylus extends the original investment in the stylus itself. Easy! Screw off okd tip, screw on new tip. Voila! New stylus"
It came with no usb cable at all.
Bought this case for my 16 yr old daughter & EVERYONE at her high school LOVES it
It charges almost as fast as the Samsung fast chargers. Very good product!
Really not impressed. Two did not work right out of the package. One stopped working in one day. The last one took a whole week before it didn't work. I didn't pay much for them and still didn't get my money's worth out of them.
"The sound is good, the microphone is horrid. Everybody I call say that the sound is muffled. Would not buy for phone use."
Broke before I even got on my cell. Was wiping away finger prints and it snapped and cracked. Not worth the wait or even 10 cents.
"I wanted to like these, but literally half of the pens didn't work at all- like the pen tip wouldn't even come down"
great for what they are. often misplace my stylus. now I can have several on hand.
Stopped working after two weeks very disatified
Broke the very first day of normal use.  The suction cup completely broke off the body.  Very poorly made.
This is my review of the [[ASIN:B00KDLL3YS UNU Enerpak Micro Battery]]. I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. The packaging the product comes in is very simple and in the box you get a user guide and a 1 foot long micro-usb charging cable. The cable can also be used to sync your phone to your computer so that's a plus.<br /><br />Onto the build of the actual battery pack this thing is incredibly small and lightweight. I weighed it at only 2.3 oz! It measures only 3.5 inches long and 1.1 or .78 inches wide depending on which side your measuring. The battery has a plastic build which contributes to the lightweight design I guess. There is also can LED light to show if the battery is charged when charging it. So it's red when charging then changes to blue when fully charged. Now the specs say this has a 1 Amp input but in my testing it actually charged slower than that at about 0.7 Amps so charging took a little bit longer than other battery packs of this capacity at about 4 to 5 hours. The USB Port outputs at 1 Amp which did output 1 Amp when I tested it with my usb power monitor.<br /><br />One thing a lot of people don't realize is that portable batteries like these are never 100% efficient so you will never get the stated capacity. So you should always estimate you'll get about 70% of the total. Sometimes more or less depending on how efficient the battery is. I tested this battery using my PortaPow USB Power Monitor and using the battery to charge up my Nexus 5. I got a total of 1566 mAh which needs to be converted so the actual number is 2116 mAh. Since the stated capacity of this battery is 2800 mAh this gives us a 75% efficiency which is the average for these battery packs. Overall the Enerpak Micro Battery from Unu is a great product for you if you want the small and lightest battery if you can overlook the long charge times and that fact that you don't get different LED colors to show your charge level. Here is a link to my review on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIgL0_IFwB8ps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIgL0_IFwB8
Bought this for my daughter's galaxy note and she loves it - great quality.
"This armband is really comfortable, unlike my last one which was scratchy and made my arm sweat. The front plastic is thin enough that all of the touchscreen buttons work."
Great case but frame sort of narrows the screen width.
Great GPS but the program you need to register and update maps will not open and run on most computers....save your money...do not buy!
Works Great!
Although the back was a bit scratched it is still a very good case. It allows me to wirelessly charge which is very important.  I tested it on three different wireless chargers: 1 ring & two 3 rings.  The single ring had no problems charging the phone.
"Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! The pattern on my case was slightly off centered, but it's only slightly noticeable. I received many compliments on this case."
I am happy with this charger. Charged it first in the house and plugged it into my phone that night.
"High Quality digitizer worked well on my kids iPad. With a help of Youtube video, i was able to repair this on my own."
Great case
"Nice looking case, it seems to have the essentials for protection against ballistic mishaps. I have yet to test its actual effectiveness (and I hope I never do)."
Great value
Beautiful cover very sturdy!
Perfect fit
"i received my car cell phone charger & tried it right away! Yes, I am happy with it & will order again from this company."
"Got this for my boyfriend and he loves it, Hold credit cards and his ID."
The difference quality can make is huge!  These came as a recommendation from a friend who is a hard core audiophile.  Well worth the money and awesome sound.
Works aspected. Great
The iPhone 6 Plus (5.5&#34;) Tribe armband is fantastic. It fits with the case I have on my phone and stays up on my arm while I run. These are strong features and very convenient! I would recommend it to a friend. I have had arm bands for other phones in the past that slipped and couldn't fit a phone case well. The shipping was rapid and I was off and running immediately!
All the cables are not working anymore. I want my money back. What a joke!
This charger works great and I love that I can plug in all of my devices and charge them at the same time.  It charges just as quickly as the wall outlet.  I would definitely purchase this again.
Great product
"I have had this phone for close to 2 months.  Up until a couple of days ago I would have rated the phone a 5, but the ringtone speaker stopped working.  I contacted Asus via eMail to find out how I get the phone fixed.  The customer service representative's response was illiterate and totally  useless information.  Now I'm faced with a dysfunctional phone as well as a seemingly dysfunctional customer service department.  I will update this review once I have resolved the problem to my satisfaction."
Can't. Get a phone to fit it
Is a great case all around. Very slim and durable.
"i had a problem in the past, destroying phones... With and without a case but now since I got an Otter box...I haven't had to replace my phone for almost 2 years"
Nice system works great
Works for 3 months and tip of cable stock in my phone. Contact saler told me have to ship the defectid item and then they raplace it. Not worth to buy
"This case is heavy duty as described, but yet it is sleek and highly durable.  For the price, I highly recommend this case to any other name-brand on the market today.  You won't be disappointed!!  Thanks."
"I had to return the first one I received. The phone would not charge in any position. The replacement will charge the phone(galaxy s5) horizontally and upside down but not right side up vertically which is ,of course, the way it needs to be if you intend to look at it while charging. I like the design but form over function will not do."
"It's CHeap! so, don't expect it to last long."
Love this product.
"I purchased one of these recently in anticipation of a Europe trip.  I didn't plan especially well and the unit showed up just two days before we left.  Unfortunately it wasn't manufactured properly and the connector receptacles didn't align properly with the case so that I couldn't get the charge connector in.  I knew that I didn't have time to return it and get a new one prior to my trip so I did some manual rework of the unit with a screwdriver so that the connector fit (but just barely).  I had heard good things about Anker but this unit was definitely made poorly and I was left with a barely functional unit that has disappointed me.  Update - After the review above where I originally gave the product 2 stars, I was contacted by Anker customer service and offered a replacement unit.  I took them up on the offer and it arrived a few days later.  I am still disappointed by the need to get a replacement but very impressed that they dealt with the issue so quickly and with so little extra work on my part.  Thanks Anker."
Get phone case...Fits perfectly & protects the phone. Also arrived on time. Thank you
This is going right back!  This product is of poor quality and looks and feels like plastic with a cloudy appearance.  I am sceptical that this is an actual BLUBOON-Tempered due to the fact that NO WHERE on the package is the name &#34;Bluboon&#34;. Just says Made In China.  Really peeved about this purchase.  Dont appreciate being cheated and mislead.
"arrived on time,  fits perfect."
"Works great! I especially love that it takes a standard USB cable for charging. I had a similar shower speaker from another manufacturer, but it took a specific &#34;wall wart&#34; AC adapter with an unusually small plug to charge it. It also didn't have the power specs on it, so I couldn't substitute another AC adapter when I misplaced the one that came with it. This one allows me to use a standard USB cable that I can find just about anywhere to charge it. Big plus. Sounds great too."
"Just as discribed. Fast shipping, just what I needed."
This just does not have the muscle to adaquitly  hold my phone.
Its not leather and the metal adapter wont fit... Scratched the inside on the apple watch... Thats what $11 get you.
Great case!
very good quality
"It was a little confusing because I thought it would be the size of an iPhone 5 but it was huge because it was actually for an iPhone 6, it still works, but the description is confusing."
Very durable! Highly recommended.
Everything was as advertised no problems installing worked just great
Came in handy while moving. I shouldn't have worn my moto 360 but I got the warranty so I wasn't too worried. Saved the screen multiple times.  Glad it came with 3 cause dust got under the first one and the second one got scratched real bad on a wall while moving the couch.
Excellent quality came when it was supposed to!
Nice cover
It very good good thank you
Fast shipping  fits perfect  and protects well
"works well and does the job. Screen protector works well, too. Easy to apply. I have basic experience in applying screen protectors."
Fine
Great product
Could not get the channels I wanted. Hard to tune.
It fits my phone perfectly. It protects it very well. I'm very happy with this purchase.
Love it Color is awesome :) :) :)
LOVE THIS CASE. I'm on my third or fourth one. They don't last that long but they are affordable and so nice because of the wallet.
Worked for my S4.
Great.
"Works OK, nothing outstanding or exciting about it..."
"It is Short! But very effective and after a month in the amazon through humidity, sun, and even a little rain, it managed to survive unharmed and still works great."
"It's a good case, I love it"
Worked great for a while. Then it would only read that the product wasn't supported by Apple and would no longer charge.
Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
"This is hands down the best thing I have ever purchased for my vehicle! I LOVE it. I have had a couple magnet holders for my truck in the past just checking them out and they all seemed to hold a little better than this. If you stick the metal piece that is attracted to the magnet to the back of your case/phone then it will definitely not go ANYWHERE. It's a very strong hold and I couldn't live without it anymore. Goes very well with a Bluetooth radio system because you don't have to mess with any wires at all unless you are charging. So you can just get in your vehicle and literally slap this thing onto your cash and BAM, it's there until you want it again. Everyone that rides with me is in amazement and I recommend it highly everytime. The main reason this item sold me is because it is so small and doesn't take much room up on my dash. The pivot is designed perfectly, it moves to where you want it with just the right amount of grip and once you let your phone go it stays put in any direction you leave it be. That was one of my main wonders when I was shopping is if it will stay tilted up or down or to the side, it will. Quit reading this review and buy the thing, I swear you won't regret it.<br /><br />The only thing I would say would be the &#34;cons&#34; is that I have noticed after having it for some time it has faded from the sun. Will attach a picture of the new color, if brown wouldn't match your vehicle and this will be in the path of the sunlight, you may want to purchase another similar item."
My package  was lost but he responded and called until we both figured it out. I will continue to purchase from him. Recommend to anybody.
"I use my iPhone grocery shopping.  Instead of laying the phone down in the cart to free up my hands, having Loopy, I always have my phone on me.  Love it!"
Does exactly what it advertised.  Plugs into my Jabra Pro headset base and turns on when I remove the headset from the base.  I work from my home do people can know not to walk into my office when I'm on a call.
Works great every time.
Was exactly what I needed and at a good price.
"I was so excited about getting this phone. I like the size and all the features. It arrived just as expected in two days. I had phone for a week now. Today, all of a sudden when I went to make a call, the receiver can not hear me. I did everything told to get volume, nothing works. Looks like I will have to send phone back.....disappointed"
This is hands down the best glass Protection for an iPhone. I have been using this glass protection for about 2 years. You can't beat the cost or the protection quality ... Great Job...
It's is good
great colors; sturdy!
Good product...meets my requirement
Perfect for my phone and easy to use.
I LOVE IT. IT WORKS GREAT AND I REALLY LOVE THAT IT TURNS OFF WHEN THE CHARGE IS COMPLETE.
Was very satisfied!!! Happy customer
It protects well.  No scratches evident since I got them placed on my phone
Tuff well made little cord !!
it worked real good
Perfect....exactly what I needed to get the job done
"It's inconvenient to carry, so I only use it on days when I know it's going to rain. I am personally fine with the fact that you can't really hear anything when the phone is on the case because that means its pretty much waterproof. It's perfect for concerts and festivals because then I don't have to worry about ruining my phone."
Excellent case for my iPhone 5S.  Easily handles phone is Otter life defender case.
"For the potential buyers that have a Samsung Galaxy 3:<br /><br />To me it feels pretty much the same. Not much of a difference except for a few.<br />The most noticeable is the appearance, of course. It is much larger and was a bit of a challenge for me since I have small hands, but you get used to it pretty quickly. The &#34;back&#34; button is placed on the left side rather on the right.<br />The Wifi connection gave me some problems, but after fumbling around a bit I was finally able to connect to further wifi hotspots rather than in my own home (this is especially important for gps/locations).<br />The call quality is pretty much the same depending on your wifi. Speakers are BEAUTIFUL on this thing! The Galaxy was loud, but this has quite a range and quality.<br />I thought the screen resolution would be a downgrade and I thought it would look &#34;fake&#34;, but I was surprised at how clear everything was. (Tsum Tsum is so much more fun to play on here!!!).<br /><br />The most important change is the storage space. This phone provides 8gb, but when you check it it will say that you have already used up to 6gb of the space. The majority of it is coming from your preloaded apps. Useless, useless apps!!<br />After some research I bought a 32gb micro sd card along with it. When you set up this phone I would disable any preloaded apps that you don't need at all (you can't delete any of them...). For any new apps that you downloaded for yourself you have the option to place it in the sd card instead of your phone storage to save space. I have about 13 apps on the side that go to the sd card and I still have 2gb space left on the phone storage, which is a good sign leaving me with 28gb of space on the sd card!<br />Keep in mind that only some apps can be transferred to the sd card.<br />Another side note is that you cannot take the back of the phone off so you can't change the battery. However, on a full day of leaving wifi conn. on and using tumblr and facebook formore than an hour (and some tsum tsum) thoughout the day only leaves me at around 60-70%<br /><br />Camera quality is alright. The thing with this is that it can be either as good as the galaxy 3 or worse. It really depends on your steady hands and how steady your object of focus is. I am fine with this camera and is the only reason why I got this phone at this price, but the quality is a downgrade for sure. It's fine in the daylight and if you have some sort of tripod, but anytime that is dark even the flash won't help that grainy look you get on cheaper phones unless you have a GOOD light source.<br /><br />This phone likes to update a lot (twice a month at this rate), but that could just be either my phone is adjusting itself or I have bad luck.<br /><br />Either way, for this price I would give this phone a 7/10 mostly because of the camera quality. Everything else is fine if you are okay with some minor changes and routines."
"The biggest complaint I hear about this product is that it's ugly and uncomfortable...Neither are true! It's extremely comfortable on my wrist and with the adjustable strap, it's perfect! I got my package yesterday and immediately opened it, charged it, and put it on! I'm in love with this fitness tracker already. Great accuracy with step tracker, calorie burn, and so much more. As a previous owner of the Nike Fuel band I was skeptical of anything else but so glad my Fuel band broke and I got to purchase this! Microsoft is stepping up in the world!"
I am not happy with this product!!! I received the product on 7/5/15 and it stopped working on 8/29/15!!!!
"Lens opening on case does not line up at all with the lens on my iPad. Case is cute, but I have to return it."
love it
Broke at the first time when on the floor and I cannot return it
Poor battery life!!!!!
"I have had the Q-card case for the iPhone 6 for six months and it is the BEST phone case I have ever had.  I am a woman and a professional.  I wanted a phone case that would have my essential items when I slipped it into an evening purse or my pocket. I keep two credit cards, my driver's license and my health insurance card. I do not keep cash in it - doing so would stretch it so that I would always have to have that thickness of contents. When a card is removed for use it is important to hold the phone/case so that the other items will not fall out.  The material/leather stretches only according to what you put in it so if you wanted to carry just two cards it would probably be okay but only if you never put more in it.  When I need something like an Atm card with me, it does not go in the phone's case it rides separately. This is not a problem at all.  And guys, yes, it will still fit in most front pockets unless you are wearing trendy jeans, flat fronted trousers, or painted on pants, none of which have real pockets.  If you want your screen protected, get a good screen protector as well. I have dropped my phone in this case and my phone is fine but I did chip the edge of my screen protector so do use one."
Good product. Fast shipping.
Bought for my wife. Looks good for the first 24 hours then it started to shed. The damn beads are every where and it is peeling. The beads get stuck to your face your hands and everything else. This product is over priced nod it's really crappy!!!!!!
Great phone. Not as fast as I would like. Still a great phobe
"Very good product, and on time delivered"
Great product
Finally one i like the quality enough to keep!
As described and shipped fast.  Very satisfied.
"First time buying a tempered glass for my phone, and this one really surprised me, I don't notice it at all it really feels like touching the screen."
"My cords all stopped working after the first +/- 2 months. They were great at first but now when I plug them in, my devices all say &#34;this accessory may not be supported&#34; and they won't charge."
Love love love my jackery!!!!
"This product arrived looking dingy and used. The clear plastic was completely scratched up. I definitely ordered new, so I'm not sure why the case came to me looking like it had been used and abused for a year or more. Best thing about it is that the mint color was true to the picture and is very stylish against my iPhone (though the back of the phone looks bad due to the deep scratches and ruins the whole point of showing off the lovely champagne color of my phone). If I could be assured that I would receive a scratch-free NEW case, I would use it. However, I am going to invest in a higher quality one since I can't trust this seller. Overall, a huge waste of twelve bucks. Highly disappointed."
Does not work
Very easy to use!
It's an otter box. It doesn't get better than this.
These are amazing! They have a good range and great bass. My only concern is that they tend to fall off the ear.
Fits perfectly. Easy to hold without fear of slipping out of hands. Nice design. Highly recommend!
The battery was as described and much cheaper than any I could find locally.  I charged it up and put it in my phone and it has worked ever since.  Good price and fast shipping.
I would recommend it to everyone! Great quality. Delivered in time. Very nicely packaged product.
"I have been using this product, for a month now and it works really well. I have had lots of charger cables in the past but this is the best hands down"
Exactly as described. Works great. Can't even tell its on the phone. Very satisfied. Would recommend.
"These hit hard! Too hard if I turn the amp up. I have 2, I could have easily got away with just 1."
"Arrived on time and undamaged.  It fit the bars fine and the rubber liners help the fit, and keep down vibration.  My Garmin Nuvi attached perfectly and does not move when underway.  For information, I ride an 18 yo Harley, so vibration was a concern.  Screen is easy to read while riding."
"this is a great product, i received a discount on my order for a fair review,<br />its made very well."
Excellent product
This shield is pretty crappy for the nexus took me awhile to get it installed. Then it doesn't cover much of the phone. I ended up getting an intelliAmor Pro for the nexus 6 it's a better fit on the phone.
Was brand new and in perfect condition!
All four wires are working
A great amp.....I scared to order at first even after reading great views. So I went to YOUTUBE.  Then heard the amp on some subs.... OMG. I'm telling all my friends about this amp...The name speaks for it self BAMF
Great product I love it but after an hour of using it my power bank stopped working I would for it to work again.
"Product arrived on time in perfect condition. The only issue is that it starts to get dirty after about two weeks, no matter how well you treat the case."
I purchased this charger to take with me on vacation recently and it failed me completely.  After using this product less than three times it just stopped working completely.
Excelent delivered before initial delivery date.<br />Works great
After two months both of the these chargers have failed.  No one will get back to me about replacements.  DON'T ORDER FROM THSES PEOPLE!!
Good
"All good so far, got them for out door activities, fit is good , simple instructions"
Feels great. Excellent response. Super easy to install. Would buy again.
"Great product, fast shipping."
"Great item but one of soft rubber pieces can off after one trip, would definitely buy again!!!"
The case seems really sturdy.  I like that there's a separate clip you can attach and it can swivel but it is not easy to turn.  You have to work at it. Definitely a good buy.
"Awesome slim design.  Slips in and out of my pockets very easily.  I've dropped my phone a few times since I've had this on my phone, once on pavement, and it has protected my phone very nicely."
Fits perfectly and it's as clear and beautiful as the original one I paid 3x more for.
worked great for about 6mos - now says its not a certified apple product
It was excellent. I love it
"Have been using this product for about a month and it really works great. Works like the original lg battery however lasts for much longer I charge it at night while im sleeping and it keeps my phone working for 2 , sometimes 3 full days, depending on usage."
The only thing is I wish I could switch out the charging cord for a longer one. But other than that it's great!
"This phone case is great for my 11 years old's first phone, he loves it!  It is easy to get on and off.  The only comment I would make is that the case is too think to keep on when the phone is on an iphone docking station."
Only case I have truly loved. The stand is great. Form factor is slim. Basic protector works well.
Arrived quickly and works great.
I just received mine and it was broken I didn't even get to use it! !!!!! Horrible care!
I love this case. A great way to keep your phone charged as well as protecting it. Definitely recommend!!
"These are great cases. I've heard that the anodized aluminum case of the sport version of the apple watch scratches very easily, so I just wanted something to protect from scratches. These are not meant for heavy duty impact protection; if that is what you're looking for I would recommend one of the full body all in one type of band/cases.<br /><br />These also improve the look of the watch, making it a little dressier and less feeling like you're wearing your fitness tracker to the office. Pair this case with a jazzy new watch band and no one will know you went the cheap route (as far as purchasing any apple product could be called cheap)! The only caveat with these cases is that they do slide on and off easily, so they could potentially catch on clothing and be pulled off of the watch. This has only happened to me once or twice while changing and is not a big deal to me."
The colors are great but the side buttons require some effort to push.
Bought it for my kid's iPhone.  It's cheap and ugly.  I'm not sure how long it will last.  The green part of the case doesn't seem very durable and it's a little ill fitting.
"Everything is almost perfect except space of charging point. When I use car charger, case needs to take off. It's not perfect for car charger."
"it does not work well, very poor quality, product already returned."
works good
"Having purchased multiple mobile accessories over the years, it seems that a few of the brand offerings stand out as far as quality, price, and customer service. RAVPower is one of them, with products that work as advertised at an excellent price. I measured the output of both outlets and they deliver 2.0 amps. Typically one is used for my RAVPower External Battery Pack, and the other to charge my Note 3 phone. I keep this plugged in near my kitchen where people tend to congregate during gatherings... it's been very useful when someone gets a low battery. They're surprised at the speed at which this charges their device. The first question - &#34;Where did you get this?&#34;, followed by, &#34;How much did it cost you?&#34;. Usually within a week, they've got one of their own."
"I received this type C HDTV Adapter cable, and it was great! just to specify the cable doesn't fit the 13 in MacBook. The quality of the cable is very durable, it's a definetely must have item and I highly recommend this product. I am greatful to have had purchased this item at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.<br />Enjoy! (:"
LOVE IT!  Now I don't need a screen protector. Best feature is the answer without opening although not sure I have figured out how to hang up without opening.
"Originally purchased it for use as a PC microphone that I could use without having to wear a whole headset. It worked well but I was limited by the battery life (about 3 hours) so didn't work well for longer gaming sessions. I wasn't too upset because it was only a few bucks. Now I use it while I ride my bike to college. Totals about 2 hours a day. I listen to music from my phone. It works well for this because it allows me to keep one ear open for situational awareness, and also because of how it is nestled in your ear it makes it very difficult to fall out. It sometimes causes me irritation if I wear it for too long, usually over 2 hours at once. But that is uncommon and very bearable when it does happen. I could not reccommend this earpiece more. It is very discreet and I have used it while working (at a bar) to listen to music and very few people noticed it. If you aren't sure about this earpiece I would say you should at least try it. For a few dollars it very well may surprise you."
Was everything I needed. Perfect item and price was outstanding
"We all have numerous electronics that require usb charging cables.  When we travel we used to have to take multiple plugs etc.  Not all hotels have power outlets in convenient locations and this solves that problem in one easy to carry item.<br /><br />As the amazon description mentions:<br />The power cord is pretty long, ( just under 5 feet) and can easily wrap around for transportation.<br />The plug has a convenient snap in spot as well.<br />It does not mention that they include a handy drawstring travel bag for the unit. (nice touch).<br /><br />So far, I have a Note 4, and an LG G watch plugged into it at night. I'll also be charging a Kindle every so often at the same time.  No issues with charging, I can not speak to the speed of the charge, as I have them plugged in all night and in sleep mode. However, I have a full charge by the time I wake (about 5 hrs later).  That is usually from a 35% charge to 100%, again I am not able to report how long that takes,, as I sleep through it.<br />This will be easy to toss in a carry-on bag for trips, or my laptop bag to and from work. I have no need for the universal plug, but who knows, maybe one day.<br /><br />I received this item for free or discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
"I bought one and was very happy with it.  Then I bought a second one was pleased with that one, too.  I like the length and sturdiness of them."
So when watchOS2 comes out this fall it will enable nightstand mode for your Apple Watch. This stand is ready for that because to use it you lay your phone sideways. I love the design of this and I am so happy its nightstand mode ready as I do not have a bedside clock.<br /><br />The stand is made out of a matte rubber and its very flexible. Its actually 2 pieces as well. You have the base which you wrap your cord around and then you have the top part which acts as a tray. Once your cord is wrapped you push your charger pod into the area designed for it then push the tray over top of it. This not only helps support the phone but hides all the excess wire.<br /><br />I have plenty of docks due to testing and reviewing but this is my daily used dock because of the design. I also love the color. If you aren't fancy on the teal they offer other options!<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes.
Lovely case and a great value.
"I choose the CD mount for my 3 Series sedan due to positioning on the center stack. I had to use scotch tape to secure the plate in the case. Simply put, the holder works. The CD mount is really secure. I have no issues pulling the phone off the magnet. I will be buying another mount for our other car."
"love it. works very well. I can lay in bed, and use this to hold my phone on my belly. awesome."
Works great out of the box.  Time will tell!
nice item
"it came on time and it also came with an extra screen protector. I loved it, it looks cute and classy on your phone and actually it's cheap. I would absolutely purchase it again if I ever loose mine."
"Updating my review.  Worked great but this one is not very durable. After a month of actual use, the end of the cable broke and got stuck in the phone.  Be aware of the warranty, tudia wants you to pay $5 to replace.  The cheaper cables last longer than these.  Will not buy this brand again."
"Perfect fit, and it comes with a anti scratch film. You can also make and cut your own design."
The screen protector is really thin and flimsy. Thought it would have been more than just a piece of plastic protecting the screen. But overall good case.
This item was purchased for a friend and he likes it. I wish the magnetic closure was more secure.
Great product.
;)
Very nice. A bit bulking but protects very well.
"The package came at record time, very fast, I like the durable and color of this case, however it is too hard for me to press the buttons.  :("
Great price. Does everything it's supposed to do!
Wasted money
"Hate it, nothing but trouble.  Spent lots of time trying to fix problems, won't upload photos, message keeps going off, and there are no messages there."
Great
After a week of use it wont hold a charge and one of the earpieces pops off. Going in the trash as soon as I buy a replacement
Fantastic! Better than anticipated and came sooner than estimated.
"Easy installation, and it will charge all my devices at the same time."
Love It Color AWESOME  :) :) :)
It was exactly what I wanted!
Sturdy cable works nicely
"It works very well.  It was a replacement for another model.  Unlike that one, this one continues to work."
"good products, fast delivery"
It did not properly fit my phone.  The hole for the camera does not line up.  It also did not stick well and was removed after the first week.
Great Case at Great Value.. thank you SupCase :)
Works great.
Far better than any other screen protector. Doesn't yellow or dent ..very durable ..full coverage ..exactly like item description.
fits great looks even better
It works!
"Looking for a protective case for the Ultimate 2 is not disappointing at all for the many styles that are available from several different suppliers who have just about COVERED all possibilities in how to protect this phone. ICE-CLEAR even offers several different two-piece hard or some soft rubber styles, and this slip-cover style made of one piece of soft silicone rubber probably offers the least amount of protection out of all of them. But it is not without its own merits. I particularly like the ability to quickly remove the cover so I can slip the phone onto an old desktop charger purchased for a GS3 that I don't use any more. Concerns regarding protection from dropping the phone are rather nil for me since I seldom ever carry a phone with me, and in all this time have only dropped two phones, both times the impact of the fall being broken when hitting my foot and then sliding harmlessly to the floor. Both of those phones were wearing silicone rubber covers similar to this one, but of better quality and not so easy to remove as this one. I would still think in the same situation this ICE-CLEAR cover would remain in place during a fall, thus helping to prevent the phone from splitting into a thousand pieces that scatter into tight and inaccessible places. So don't expect that this cover will offer any protection other than that. ICE-CLEAR even throws in a protective screen shield and a metallic blue stylus, both of which I didn't need. But as is, it works just fine for me because this case provides a more positive grip whenever I'm holding the phone."
worked just fine
"OK. . So after trying 3 other protective covers, this is the only one which fits the Note 4 precisely. The holes in the  cover line up with the ports on the phone. It doesn't add any weight to the phone. This cover has enough 'lip' around the sreen to protect it when posed face down on a smooth surface. It is sturdy and thick enough to protect the phone when it drops to the floor. I am totally happy with this protection time cover"
I have these in my 2008 F-150 and they sound really good.  I wish I had put an amp on them because I'm sure they would rock even harder.  I am very pleased with the performance and would buy this again.
Excellent
I just got this item. It came within a couple days of ordering which is nice. It seems very durable! So far so good.
"Very Impressed with soundance bluetooth headset. I was able to get these for a discount for an honest review. I couldn't be happier. Pros -Very crisp sound. I like to listen to music and they sound excellent. Does not sound like a tin can like others ive tried. -Compact - i can easily and comfortable put these in my ear with out feeling like an idiot. - Snug - while running and working out never felt like they where going to fall out. -  4 hour battery life on play time. - reliable never felt like it was acting odd or doing what it shouldn't. - Plenty of features with the Play and next track buttons, pretty standard. Never felt clunky - Comes with a functional hard case. Love the case wasn't expecting that doesn't feel cheap.  Cons distance is only 10 meters, not that i can expect more from the compact size the USB port was a little hard to get open at times but not a deal breaker.  Overall this is an excellent product and had a great experience testing it out. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this. Ive tried a few other small headsets this one is the best so far for every day use."
great product
case snapped on easily but now phone does not fit in carry case.
"I would give this product 4 or maybe 5 stars, however; after about a month and 8-10 uses, the bluetooth won't pick any of my devices up any more! Sometimes, it starts out okay, but the signal gradually fades and then the signal is &quot;Out of Range&quot;. Again, I'd be very pleased with this product if it lasted, but it didn't.<br /><br />UPDATE - After reading my review, Patozon sent me a new pair of headphones for free. I only received them today, so I'll reserve judgment for the moment. Although I can't speak for the new set yet, I can speak for Patozon customer service. They didn't hassle me. They sent me one email, apologized, and informed me that they were sending a new set. Excellent customer service.<br /><br />UPDATE #2 - My new set of headphones has worked flawlessly, to date. I'm very happy with the purchase and would not hesitate to buy from Patozon in the future."
Computer does not recognize it as a compatible cable.
more than 30% shows wrong address or navigation path
It works!!!!
"Seriously, if you don't have this on your $600+ phone you're making a mistake.<br />I slapped on of these on my mom's phone and forgot all about it.<br /><br />She freaked out after dropping her and cracking the screen<br />and I reminded her about the temper glass screen protector.<br />I peeled off the cracked screen protector and behold! The iPhone screen was without a scratch!<br /><br />Spend the $5 and just get it!"
Nice phone
Did not like at all. Kept sliding and would not stay in place.
Garbage case. Phone fell out twice!<br />I returned it before it broke my phone
"Wireless is great!  Good range for indoors. Battery life is just a few hours, so plan on recharging often (not a deal- breaker).  Stays in ear pretty good; would have been nice to have a few more loop sizes."
Easy to appy (bubbles really do disappear like magic!) .  Prompt shipment was also appreciated.  I will definitely order from this seller again.
"Let me start off by saying this case is very nice looking. It is sleek and has a great texture to it. However, after using the case for only a few weeks, it has started falling apart. The case fits the device VERY tightly. Definitely too tight of a fit. It was incredibly difficult to take the case off of the phone, during a couple instances when I needed to take my SD card out. It seems that after difficultly prying the case off of the phone, the bumper part of the case has begun to peel off. This is very unfortunate for me as I really like this case. I would like to get a new one, but I feel that this flaw is too great. I have to take my case off now and then, which is impossible with this case."
"Was expecting a case for the Galaxy S6 Edge, but received a case for the iPhone 6. The barcode on the packaging was a barcode for the S6 Edge stuck on top of an iPhone 6 barcode."
Excelente producto
"I registered my product at fusionexcelintl.com, it worked perfectly."
Works great
Workes awesome
These are great!  This is my second set.
Good!!
Its waterproof but that makes it hard to hear
Very nice. A little bulky.
great one i like it
This is a tad bulky and heavy but its great for long events like concerts when you will be sucking the juice from your phone and esp when your friends phones die and they always want your portable charger!!!
No one ever takes my picture.  All pics I have are of everyone else in the family.  Not any longer.  It's really easy to use.  A little tight on my iPhone6S because it has a protective cover on it and makes the phone absolutely as large as the prongs will spread.  Works like a charm.
You get what you pay for
"The original batteries were defective, and after miscommunication with the seller; I received adequate replacements...but then the charging station literally melted."
"Good product so far, bought two...we had two Newtrent products & both quit charging up, so without a charged battery to charge, they were useless & had to be replaced.  Went with a different brand because the reviews were good, the price was excellent & Anker was in the top 5."
Fit perfect and works very well.
To big.  Don't like it.
good case
Good quality
I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Syncs perfect with your smart phone and looks like this watch costs me hundreds.  My husband is literally obsessed with his new gadget.
"You get what you pay for on this one.  Unfortunately, they feel really lightweight and cheap, and the stylus only works when fully upright.  You can't hold it at an angle.  Worse (and shame on me for not catching it in the description), the ink in all of these is black.  I don't know that I've ever owned a pen with bright colors like these that only write in black.  Oddly disappointing."
"Fantastic case but the only downside is that the side buttons are more equipped for the iPhone 5 not 5c as advertised. I have to push to hard and I don't want to damage iPhone itself. This item is great, protects otherwise!"
"Expensive, and takes 2 weeks to get, but it seems Apple products only charge correctly with factory Apple charge cords, which is a shame."
"This antenna Is a great upgrade,  with it I am able to pick up transmissions out to about 50 miles away."
good cables for the price
Excellent product for the money!  It's very well made and attractive..even came with screen protector!
this new tom tom is great as other one was old and would tell you to turn after you past the street or exit. thank you
Pretty and protects!!
Clean and clear. Hard to believe it has a protector over the actual screen
Product was ok. Not really what my daughter wanted but it was suppose to arrive in 3days and she needed this before school started. well 3 days turned into 6.
The product got delivered as described in the product description..
I love my case!!! It's very well made
I have had the glass on for 2 weeks now and it is lifting up all around the edges
Exactly what I needed!
Great product
Good quality
"Cant wait to take it on vacation ! Arrived on time, and works great with my iPhone."
Great cases!!! Great quality!! Nice.
"Amazing, I put them in my 2002 Jetta and they were able to kick some decent bass. For about 30$ a pair, they were really impressive"
Was as advertised
"This case is by far the best out there for the price.<br /><br />The rubber-like outside material is smooth and tough (except around the edges, just a little excess) thus making it easy to grab on to. The inside hard plastic piece is rugged and durable allowing for drops to be absorbed through the casing. Again, the plastic has a little excess around the edges. The only problem I face with the inside casing is that it's a bear to take on and off; however after minor adjustments I have not needed to take it off since.<br /><br />As for the plastic covering the various holes and ports, they cover everything with a secure fit so dirt will stay out, which is very nice.<br /><br />Then there's a screen protector. Oh boy, the screen protector. First off, I noticed the plastic was being scratched very easily by normal wear-and-tear inside my pocket. Also, the plastic has a faded off-white appearance that looks dirty and makes the screen more reflective of outside light.<br /><br />Also with the internal frame, the plastic ridges on the sides, top and bottom next to the screen are very high. It's hard, for example, to close ads that are in the corners or on the edges, or to play games that involve you to tap in any of those locations. It could also be that I have stubby fingers, but to me those ridges seemed unnecessarily high.<br /><br />The most annoying thing however was that the protector did not meet the screen, so I was having to push harder for the touch screen to register. That was very annoying. To fix this problem I took to it with my handy pocket knife. I found that the screen protector was secured to the internal plastic frame by only a couple dabs of cheap glue. I was able to easily pry off the plastic.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great buy for the extremely cheap price. I am very happy with my purchase."
Took it on a road trip in the middle of the summer and I guess the heat was too much for the plastic so it broke and fell right off my windshield while I was driving. Only used it 3 times before it broke.
"Performs exactly as I would expect it to. I saw that other reviewers said that the life of the battery didn't last long and it looked like it was previously used, but mine looked brand new and performs as such."
Very good for the price....I highly recommend this produce
Am really disappointed I bought 2 of this last week and I only got 1screen and after fixing it on my phone  it has a black line in exactly the middle very disappointed with this seller
This is the second time I order this screen protector. I constantly drop my phone in its face and this protector probably started to get a little damaged around the 20th time I dropped it. But it did its job and protected my actual screen! There wasn't one scratch on it
great speakers. was really shocked by  the sound considering the price
Nice & sturdy. Fits phone well & kickstand works great
This case works great
Fast Delivery good product
stopped working after few days  horrible......
Perfect picture perfect quality
I should have read the other reviews more carefully. This is one of the Spigen cases that scratches the frame. I only had my phone in the case for 4 days and when I removed it the the top and sides of the metal frame were scratched. There is nothing I can really do about it at this point so I just returned the case and bought something else. I don't know how this case is still allowed to be sold after so many complaints.
"Nice and small profile, provides a decent bit of grip. Not super protective, but seems to be holding up well 6 months later."
Great construction and I can keep my phone in it's case!
I really love this case. It looks exactly as described in the photo. It's so chic and classy. One of my favorite cases thus far. Great find :)
"Lasted 6 weeks, then broke."
"I love it.is so pretty. the only thing is; you can't put away to much in it,just few things as I'd credit cards.few things. But other wise.I recommended."
Charger doesn't work after 3 weeks.
Just what I wanted.  Quality is Great.  Would buy again
"works great, charges fast"
Speakers sound great and look awesome!
This wireless charger works great for the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. All you will need is a wall adapter plug and you are good to go. Make sure to place the disc in the center of the phone to work properly. The screen will show a blue ring with a battery percentage in the center  that indicates it's charging. It is only a little over 2.5 inches so it will not take much space. For the price it is a great deal.
"Have used this product for about two months now as my daily charger at work. Quality has been good, no experiences of not charging or being warned by iOS that the device is unsupported. Would (and probably will) buy this product again."
"I have owned Samsung smartphones in the past as well, as previous LG G2 and now the G4, which I have had for one month.  Whenever I read a review about this phone, I generally hear such &#34;CONS&#34; about the button position and the build quality. Just so you know, I appreciate both those features a great deal. First, the buttons, I hardly, if ever, use the buttons. I set the volume and forget it, what I don't like about phones with buttons on the top or side is that when you grab your phone or fish it out of your pocket, you can accidently send the caller to voice mail, disconnect them or decrease or increase the volume requiring you to phone fiddle, call back the caller or go to voice mail if they leave a message... a hassle. If I am at my desk and I get a call, I set my G4 to answer when I pick it up and say &#34;Hello&#34; no buttons to push... CONVENIENT.  sECOND. &#34;THE BUILD QUALITY AND APPEARANCE&#34;  Metal components on a phone adds to the weight when compared to plastic, metal can be dented and metal reduces the sensitivity of the phones receiver because it can block weak signals from the cell tower. As far as &#34;Appearance&#34; ... what the heck, most people are going to put a case on it anyhow.  If you like the touch features on your phone then you should know that the G4 can do everything by screen touch alone, even the home button is virtual and you can move it and the others around for your convenience and operating comfort.  Is it the fastest phone? No it is not. Is there any phone that is twice as fast? No there is not and even if there was what would it get you?  Typically, a G4 can open an app in one second, if there was a phone twice as fast then it could open an app in 1/2 second. What i9s that 1/2 second worth to you?  Battery Life for texting and calling can easily last the full day. Turning on Bluetooth, NFC, GPS, WiFi, full screen brightness and Hotspot will surely kill your battery in  3 hours but you can quickly replace it in 30 seconds and go on.for another 3 hours and by then your reserve can be ready again.  Tap the screen anywhere twice and the phone wakes up, in camera mode tap the screen anywhere it it snaps a picture.  In my estimation the lack of side buttons is a big convenience except my girlfriend is still disconnecting me when answering her S4 !  OK... It doesn't have a finger print reader but there are four other types of phone Locking methods such as, pin code, knock code, face recognition and voice recognition. As I said, when my phone is asleep... all I have to do is pick it up and say Hello, this feature can be turned off so that you do have to press the screen button to answer.  Lastly, right here on Amazon for the price of just $8.00 you can order a G4 Wireless charging receiver for your phone and install it in a under 5 minutes and that can be coupled to a regular or &#34;Fast Charger&#34; that the G4 supports."
"Nice and sturdy, not cheap. Fits perfectly"
My S-10 works very well. I'm a happy camper with my purchase.
work well
It powers two iPhone 6's or an iPhone + iPad on road trips w/no issues.  We have three and none have had issues.
The microphone worked and the left earbud but the right one didn't on all 3. Don't waste the money buy better ones
"One word of warning.. if you upgraded a win8 computer to 8.1 you MUST find upgraded 8.1 bluetooth drivers, or unit will NOT function!  this warning should be included.  Past that, product when everything is upgraded.. sound is awesome!  product easily connects to bluetooth devices.. No complaints here!"
It fits very well but the back doesn't look very appealing it looks like there's water behind the case. But when it comes to protection it does the job.
No one can here you during phone calls.
"Great for long car rides, hold iPad 3 perfectly."
lovely case... fits perfectly on my phone and am loving it
"Awesome case, handily you can charge the case separately to the phone which speeds up charge time! Only complaint is the speaker reroute is not very good; sounds a bit tinny I drilled two extra holes in the bottom to allow sound to escape the case; seems to have sorted that issue nicely! Just looks like there is a headphone jack hole on both sides :)"
"the phone was in visually excellent condition, but some how it went through refurbishment without being able to be charged. not very useful without power."
Great product!  Arrived on time
"I barely had my Vivofit 2 for a week and it popped off somewhere. So it is lost. I thought it did a decent job as an activity tracker and I was getting back on an exercise and calorie counting regimen, but the clasp did not hold up to rugged work. I am positive it was locked in, but must have popped loose when I was hauling logs. Very disappointed that lost it that quickly. Onward..."
"Looks great, BUT lasted a little over a month. The lightning port broke while I was unplugging it... I'm never buying Aduro products again."
Charging connector did not work.  Broken on inside.  I could hear it rattling.
It works great and I love that everything is on the front not the back
This replacement screen is noticeable smaller than the original size.  Not happy with the product.  I would recommend purchasing from another vendor.
Love this case. It has been one of the best cases I've had!!!
My father loves the case it protect his phone .
"Maybe I got a bad battery, but I don't think this one works even as well as the 9 month old original one it replaces. I've stopped using it and will be returning it."
Absolutely love this power bank!! Charges my phone fast and helps me to keep up with my customers for my business!
This phone is out of my hand but it's working and the person who receive it is loving it no complain no problem man
"Now I can tell my phones from my son's...LOL It doesn't seem to be quite as securely on the phone as the original one I had, but I like it a lot."
Nice throw away item.
"This case is awesome! Holds the phone, 2-4 credit cards/id's and plenty of room for cash. I get compliments on it all the time. Loved it so much I bought one for my mom. Had an issue and customer service had it corrected in 24 hours. Really impressed!"
Plugs into the wall (with adapter) and then plugs in to the device. Charging/Syncing happens. Goal achieved.
Great product and great service!
Bad quality
"I am well satisfied with the Mophie 2200.  Is it real or a knockoff?  It sure looks real to me.  The packaging, product, and instructions are first rate.  It was at half charge out of the box.  It seems to loose a little charge during the day.  You absolutely MUST use the provided cable.  The one that came with the phone is to light weight.  It has too much loss.  It will work even better with a higher amperage charger like the one from a tablet. The fully charged Mophie will only recharge my S3 to about 60% ( wonder if it might be old/new stock?).  Which is okay for my needs.  It fits my phone perfectly!  No removing the back of the phone or anything like that.  I added a screen protector to protect the screen.  Both seem to protect the phone somewhat.  I don't think it comes anywhere close to the protection that I gave up using the Otter Box Defender (which leaks dust and dirt like a screen door and lasts less than a year before the rubber deteriorates).  The LEDs, switches, and case cutouts perform perfectly.  The buttons are somewhat sensitive, like on the phone itself.  Takes some getting used to after having to mash the buttons on the Otter Box.  It solved two of my needs. 1. No need to carry a spare battery in my pocket.  2. Saves the wear and tear on my phone recharging jack which can be somewhat fragile.  I am totally happy with this purchase, especially at the price of less than $20.  Now if could only find the drop in charger for it.  How cool would that be?"
Great
These cords are junk. Most of them stopped working within the same day!!! I had 1 cord last a week....
"Item as described, delivered in a timely manner."
Dghfhcg
Great charger- was able to quickly charge smartphones and iPad and the flashlight came in handy as well.
Thank you so much super fast delivery. Only took 2 day to get to my house.... and works gr8
it looked nice but it was pretty low quality and came in broken
If it was possible to give more than 5 stars I would have. I have always liked Plantronics headsets but this is the best one yet. The range is great and the sound quality is amazing. I would truly recommend to a friend.
Not as expected...slow delivery.
"Works good, item as specified. Nothing more to say"
EXCELENT
excelent
Love it! I used it for a few months until it broke..but honestly it lasted so much longer than I expected it to.
"Great device however, it's kept kicking me off the Bluetooth."
"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
"I bought this as a present for my 8 year old daughter. I spent ages downloading MP4s to put on it but the only video formats it plays is .AMV and .MTV...Good look finding those. Even when I downloaded a converter; it still wont recognise the files. It's hard to work, it's very quiet and it crackles. I thought I'd grabbed myself a bargin, but I was wrong. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
feels good when running but i feel like sooner or later it will rip.
This thing rocks.  Took two on a week-long trip inside Grand Canyon.  Charged all the Go-Pro cameras for the entire week.
"Worked well, easy to install and does protect screen. You do have to wipe down the protector a lot."
Didn't work. . . At all. :-/
I luv it 👍
Works great and looks good too. Uses your existing Apple Watch charging cable and allows a convenient stand to prop your IPhone or other device to charge overnight while your watch is charging.
"I have it working, I love it. Excellent"
Well you get what you pay for here. I wear mine on my belt but it kept jumping off my belt because the metal clip was not very secure. I ran my belt through the webbing behind the metal clip and the webbibg is tearing and starting to separate from the case. Spend a little more and get something better. A stingy man pays twice
"Was able to easily use the tool to replace my band. I did bend one of the pins, so it was nice that I was able to use one from my old band."
Great
Was delivered on time works well and I would recommend.
"This case fits my galaxy s6 perfectly and it is slim and sleek looking, I love it.  My favorite case by far, the best part is that it fits into my armband for my daily runs without having to take it on and off.  Love the fact that I can get the protection I want for my phone without a big bulky ugly case.  I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
So far it is awesome.  The mirror is alright
"I don't get 11 hours of talk time but this fits well, is easy to use and very clear reception."
Incredible screen protector. The technique used to apply the protector itself is just magnificent. I'm very pleased.
Rapid response and correct parts delivered :-)
It interfaced with my old Galaxy S3.  I'm still working on figuring it out.  Sometimes I even have trouble getting it to turn on. That cannot be operator error!  Have managed to get some pretty awesome selfies.
Worked perfectly.
Great
"I love this handy little device. My favorite feature is the ability to press a button and disable a charging port. This allows me to leave my chargers, cables, and devices connected without overcharging or burning up cables (FYI: A CABLE CAN BE BURNED OUT PREMATURELY IF IT IS LEFT PLUGGED IN WITHOUT BEING CONNECTED TO A DEVICE - via BestBuy Tech). Thanks for a high quality product Bestek!"
I got a two pack and neither screen would stick down along the rounded edges of watch screen.
"This is an Awesome product!!! The compatibility with Echo is great, easy set up as well"
I only use it on road trips and so far it works great as long as I have a cell tower signal.
"I like my new case from #Ghostek it is pretty💣since Lifeproof wanna bullcrap on making a Fr&egrave; for the 6 plus. I'm not fond of their Nu&uacute;d case but I am VERY fond of this Ghostek case, I submerged this case in water and there was NO WATER AT ALL inside of it!! I got this case and am very glad that I made the purchase while getting qualified for the Amazon.com Chase credit card with $1,000 credit limit & $200 cash advance didn't hurt neither😉fyi: I have a GLASS HD screen protector by Amzer on underneath the plastic screen protector that is on the case & my phone works fine with NO problems at all. It's very CLEAR while viewing & still easy to use the touchscreen. I wish that the case would have come EXACTLY as advertised with only 2 holes in the front but it has 3 & the extra hole at the top isn't needed because the phone only has 2 holes in the front on the screen. That's my only issue with it so that's why I gave it 4⭐️instead of 5 because the picture is false advertising in my eyes because I expected to have the EXACT same front for my screen. I called my son and he said I sounded muffled a little bit but it's barely noticeable so we switched phones and I didn't hear anything, maybe I need a hearing aid, so I'll just wait until someone else calls me and tells me I sound weird or something to comeback and do an update for that part of the phone. I like how my phone is completely covered it is not a piece of my phone uncovered and I like that ALOT!! It's like my Zero Lemon case but waterproof with a plastic screen protector on top of my Amzer tempered glass screen protector. #Ghostek #Apple #iPhone6Plus"
it arrived quickly and it's gorgeous. i love that i don't have to carry a separate wallet. it's well made and i love the color.
"This product is very simple to install and fits seamlessly to the Galaxy Note 5. The kit comes with an alcohol wipe, microfiber cloth, 2 dust remover stickers, and 1 glass screen protector. I first cleaned the phone with the alcohol wipe, wiped it off with the microfiber cloth, and then used a dust remover sticker over the entire surface of the screen. After cleaning the phone, I lined the glass screen protector up and placed it flat upon the phone. It will gradually &#34;suction&#34; to the screen of the phone - this is a huge improvement from the sticky plastic screen protectors that you had to gradually apply and almost always resulted in a few bubbles. There was one air bubble left over after the glass protector suctioned to the screen, and I was easily able to slide it out through the periphery with my microfiber cloth. The glass protector is exceptionally clear and feels just like the phone screen. I have not noticed any color distortion with this product. There is about a 2 mm margin between the edge of the screen protector and the edge of the phone, but I did not feel this to be terribly noticeable. I think the margin is actually a perk because it prevents you from applying the protector too close to the edge, which would inevitably prevent the edges of the protector from laying flush against the screen. I would absolutely purchase this product again in the future."
This is a very convenient way to hold your phone and get to where you need to go safely!
"Definitely it wasnt as good as they said, Phone died after 2 months. I bought it to bring it to Ecuador,<br />I had to pay to unblock it here,  Then the battery  always discharged quickly, finally last friday  august 28 the phone didnt charge anymore,<br />I bought another battery and didnht resucite, Its a piece of garbage, I am in southamerica, who is going to replace it??<br />I trusted I bought a  great phone but it was a rubbish,  BE CAREFUL"
"I love, love love this cell phone clutch.  I have 3 different ones and this one is by far the prettiest.  Good quality.  Well worth it."
This product did not fit my phone and it was the correct model.
"Product covers entire surface of iPhone 6, cutout for the home button is very precise. This was not my first purchase from intelliarmor so I have had experience installing previous products. I was a little disappointed with the installation accessories, mostly because the cleaning film was flimsy and didn't take off 100% if the dust. I was able to use some of the installation accessories from the M9 screen protector I had installed right before. But the product itself once installed is perfect."
Worked good for a while and after 3 days the selfie stck with glue came out and it did not hold the IPhone 6 plus. The company sent me a new one. This worked very well with iphone 6. With 6 plus it is heavy and unsteady but worked great with iphone 6!
"Love my new case.<br />Fits my phone perfectly, allowing me to charge w/o removal from case.<br />Description was accurate & delivery was on time as expected."
like the camera feature and photos taken w/ the phooe are clear and nice
Its annoyingly good at reminding me to get up and move.  Wish it would track 'movement' as well as steps.. and of course I wish it had a vibrate feature. but so far so good.
This case is gorgeous and it protects my phone so well! Definitely something I would buy again!
Good for Venezuelan people
nice product
"Superb...<br />Great case, good protection, feels great in your hand, and a [low price]... what more can you want from a case???"
"I have only had this product for a couple weeks now. I followed the directions and it installed easily, looked great and I was really please with it. However after only a week it had a small chip on the side and a deep scratch on it. I haven't dropped in and while it has been in my pocket for a short time with keys the hardness factor advertised on this says it is one step below diamond. A key should not easily scratch it. But to be safe I stopped carrying it with my keys.<br /><br />Now a few days later I see a crack in it. Now I didn't have my keys in my pocket, I keep a silicone case on the phone that overlap the front edge and I haven't dropped the phone at all in the past week so no idea while it is cracked.<br /><br />My wife has another brand of tempered glass covering on her iphone6+. It is a bigger phone than my regular iphone 6 and she throws it in her bag with all her keys and stuff and has no cracks or major scratches on hers after 6 months -- even with my 7yo dropping her phone all the time while playing games.<br /><br />very disappointed in this product. I don't expect it to last forever, but to only last for 2 weeks with light use is terrible."
"I was a bit skeptical about how cool the virtual reality headsets would be. I thought there's no way they can be as fun and amazing as people claim. That was, until I got these in the mail! I downloaded a few apps, a Rollercoaster simulator, a couple mazes, and of course being me and the zombie fanatic I am, zombie shooter ones. As the person using them they are amazing. ALL you see is what's on the screen and it really does feel like you're there. This set blocks out all excess light and fits a variety of heads! My husband is even more skeptical on EVERYTHING than I am and even he enjoyed it! My boys didn't want to give my phone back after they tested it out but this mama needed it... so she could keep playing with the VR herself lol. The controller was very easy to connect to my phone and came with the batteries needed for it which was great because we don't typically have AAAs lying around the house. If you are in the market for a great VR headaet, these are AMAZING!<br /><br />Side note, my best friend and coworker lived these too, he walked around with the headset on and open for like 10 minutes before he even got to try the apps out. We both thought it was hilarious that he looks like the guy from trailer park boys with the cats lol. There is an included image of that!.<br /><br />I got these at a discount for my honest review!"
Fits great. Not too thick. Easy to take off but stays on securely. I've had 2 othe glow in the dark cases and this one glows the brightest.
"Genus design, I love it. Bought one first as a gift, then had to get one for myself. If I could give more than 5 stars I would."
"*This is an update to a previous review.  The Alaska Life has amazing customer service and will do what it takes to make sure you are taken care of as a consumer.  After reporting an issue with my product, they responded and got the product replaced immediately.  If you are stuck on making a purchase between a few different products, be assured that this choice comes with excellent service to support.  Can't go wrong.  Looking forward to the future products ahead."
Works perfectly
"Perfect, covered nicely my phone with glass protector on the top."
I really like this style case.
Good
Love this item!!
"Delivered sooner than expected, easy to apply. Great screen."
Perfect fit and cute as ever.  Took a long time to get.  But it was worth it😊
Despite being listed as a hard case - this case is not worth the price. Even if it was $2 at 5Below it would be overpriced. The &#34;hard&#34; case aspect does not even stay snapped shut without an iPod in it. Drop it from even the smallest height and it will crack. Not worth it. Pretty but it's going back.
Great product. Easy ans simple instructions ships super fast<br /> Would recommend this product to.anyone..Great job!!
"Good product.  Along with the screen protector I also bought, I feel safer carrying th IPod around."
Very good cover!
Not sure on it .
"For the price, these were good length cables. However, they were fairly finicky when it came to staying plugged in and charging. Movement of the attached device could easily stop the charge, and one of the three completely stopped working after about 2 weeks. One works fairly consistently, and the third will only work if the device is completely stationary. Would not buy again."
It did not work and we tried to make it work.
Does the job it is supposed to do....
it didn't fit my phone
Came in perfect condition but only thing is the double case doesn't fit exactly with eachother
"It's a nice design, nice colors, but it does add a significant amount of bulk. And it doesn't feel like the front and back pieces lock securely. It feels like if I were to drop my phone the case would fall apart.<br />I wouldn't buy this product again."
Just as expected. Get a lot more time out of my phone now!
I love my case
"Portable Charger arrived promptly, was inexpensive, and worked great. Highly recommend."
It is great!!
Works great
First one was defective but power add replaced right away and everything great now.  Thanks Poweradd!
fast shipping thankyou
EXCELENTE
Good unit...big advantage is the retractable cord.
"Awesome screen protector! I was having touch issues on my G4 with my previous tempered glass cover, this one is much better and much more responsive!"
"I Have had these headphones for just over a month now and almost like clockwork, both pairs I ordered have started to malfunction. Neither were great to begin with and I probably should have returned them straight away but time slipped by I was uncertain if my kids would like these or not. In any case, here are my complaints.<br />1 - Unless you sit DIRECTLY in front of the transmitter on your unit, you get static. Anything more than 15 degrees off center and static starts to creep in.<br /><br />2 - The volume level on these are not loud at all. We own a van which has an average amount of road noise however, at full volume, these are not lous enough for me or my kids to block out even very quiet noises. I can only turn the car radio on to about 1-2 for my wife and I while the kids use these otherwise they say that can't hear and ask us to turn down the radio. I tried it myself and they were right.<br /><br />3. - For the 30 minutes I tested these headphones, I noticed the ear foam pads were thin and irritating. I think for a longer movie I would be bothered by soreness."
"This is the best screen protector I have ever used. I followed the directions for application closely. At first there were a number of bubbles and I was worried that they wouldn't go away, but I watched, and each day there were fewer bubbles. By the fourth day, there were no bubbles and the cover is flat and easy to see through. This is not this flimsy plastic like other screen protectors. It is more like window tint for vehicles. I would recommend that you purchase this and be patient...the bubbles will go away. Just follow the directions. The wait is worth it."
"I love this case! It is a light and durable minimalist case. The orange trim is fun, and the clear back really highlights the elegance of your iPhone without covering it. The material is very grippy, so I never feel like my phone will slip out of my hand. There is sufficient coverage around the entire face of the phone (no corners uncovered) so if I set it down face-first the case (and possibly my screen protector) are the only points touching. I gave it 4 stars only because the edge of the case separated along the back of the phone after many months of use. But I like the case so much that I ordered another one - same exact one and same exact color. I think it is good value for the money."
"Compact size and work well. Also, shipping was very fast."
"I'm really liking this thing.  It is sad that the phone chews up battery so quickly but this turns out to be the answer.  Of course, I no longer have a thin and svelt phone ... it does stick out a bit now.  But no so much as you'd think.  I'd put up with a much thicker battery if it would last twice as long as this one.  As to metrics, I've gone from getting about 4-5 hours standby with the OEM battery to a full day or longer with this.  It is wonderful to not have to pack a couple of spares and two chargers when I go out."
Fits perfectly. Good grip.
I got this for my mother and it's perfect it fits well and the pocket doesn't stretch and get loose like others it's just perfect for my mother
Easy to install and appears to work as expected.
The product broke after a week of use
"Very disappointed with this product. The screen protector was supposed to fit the phone perfectly but instead I ended up having to cut it down as it was 1/4&#34; too wide on both sides, not to mention that none of the pre-cut holes really lined up either. I ended up using all 3 before I got it even close to the size it was supposed to be and looking decent."
works as promised on my S6/
really beautiful!  Lots of compliments!
Works perfectly with our 2 USB's. Now we have a free plug for other items
Excellent product!!!
The user manual is all but useless. They don't explain the steps in near enough detail. In my opinion this is not a user friendly dash cam. Still trying to get video to play on computer but the steps they say needed for playback aren't getting me there. Some buttons you have to hold for a period of time others you don't and certain buttons need to be hit before others. The manual says nothing about the ok button they ask you  to use. Just so you know its the record button and the manual calls it the confirmation key. ( think they could have just called it what it is THE RECORD BUTTON ) The manual totally amps up the aggravation in using this dash cam. If you're lucky or smart enough to figure it out I'm sure its a great little unit. I found the play back as I'm writing. It amazes me how a company can create such high tech. and then screw up the manual so bad. Is it to much to ask for a company to put just a little thought into the manual. The manual should say press X for 3 seconds then use the MIC button then when menu comes up here are the additional steps. Its just an absurdly written manual that assumes you know more than some of us do.
It did not fit as advertised. If you have a note 3 from verizon it will not work.
I was surprised that the wallet was of good quality. It fit my daughter's Galaxy Express perfect.
"This is one of the nicest screen protectors I have ever seen. It is thin but thick enough for protection. It's not easily scratched and it fits like a snug. My sister who has a note made me give this to her. I guess she needs it as much as she drops her phone lol. When we opened the box, it was so nice and sophisticated in the box. It was well packaged and it is very sleek looking. It comes with a alcohol pad and a cleaning cloth. Everything you need to get you started. I ran my fingernail across the screen to see if anything would pick up and NADA...that was nice to me but the best thing of all, no air bubbles. I have air bubbles and there's no chance of any getting inside. I am very pleased. I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review at a discounted rate. I would gladly recommend this product. Great Great Great screen protector. Great investment!!"
"This is so handy to have when you're out all the time, or doing long distance drives. I don't go anywhere without it."
"This thing is awesome. It's robust, handles heat well, and charges your phone more efficiently than the manufacturer's cord (which, incidentally, for a phone that costs in the hundreds of dollars, its own cord is absolute garbage). My only regret is that I didn't buy the longer cord."
Work greats. Charge my phone quickly. Highly recommended!
"owning so many iPhone 6 in this house scares me to death to have without have a glass screen protector on them. The ones in the stores cost so much money and they don't seem to last that long for the price you pay for them<br />The Siania screen protector arrived and I was so happy because it came just in time when my daughters IPhone arrived:) I had my husband put it on and he said that it was easy to apply and it looks great on her phone. No smudges are anything. You can't even tell that it is on there at all:) I'm very happy with it and so is she. Normal screen protectors without the glass show so much that you just want to rip the screen protector off,but these you don't want to:)<br />I highly recommend this. It not only protectors your phone,but if it cracks usually its just the screen protector and at this price you can always get another one with no problem:)<br />I received this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done:)"
"These are amazing! I have ordered several for friends and family. The warranty is unbeatable, I actually did drop my phone and it did its job and just shattered the protector. The company sent me a new one at no charge."
Great price!  Fast shilling!
I love the way this cover looks and fits my phone.
The best glass you can find. I can hardly tell that I got the glass on my phone.
"Terrible. Stopped working, no longer charging, after 2 months. Don't waste your money."
Better than I expected for the price. I feel my phone is protected and the rubber on all 4 corners is pretty thick.
I was so looking forward to this but it doesn't fit my car's VERTICAL air vent. I gave it to a family member. It was so easy to setup and use. It would have been perfect if it would fit MY car. I didn't want the kind that sticks to the window.
Great fits my phone perfect.  Enjoy the just enough of the rubber it helps grip so my phone doesn't fall out of my pocket.
The screen looked great but when I placed my finger on one area it would click on a different area. This is the second screen I have had trouble with.
Fast charging!
Good Quality 👍
Fast delivery and looks great!
"Provides good charge times but the way the prongs are positioned means it can take up an extra socket if you're using it on a surge protector like I am. Other than that, it's OEM-like in quality for a fraction of the cost."
not good broken item.
Did not work for my phone (samsung galaxy legend) despite it being in the product title. the plug fit in the phone but the phone never charged. waste of money.
Super Cute. Has a faint weird smell but can't really tell unless your nose is smashed into the case.
"I'm using it with the Nokia DT-910 charging stand, and it constantly disconnects and reconnects, with the iPhone vibrating twice each time, which is much more annoying that fiddling the iPhone into a normal charging stand, or a cable into the iPhone."
Great to be ably to charge multiple items at once.  Great price and delivery.
Excellent purchase
great
Watch as durable it's a nice thick rubber style band Durable.  Screen size is perfect viewing the best you can get for a watch. It has all the capabilities of a normal phone would have. But it sure beats the price of those iPhones.  I plan on getting a Nother one. And I did receive this for a heavily discounted/free to give a honest review on.
"I purchased this for my 13 year old grandson and this is his review:<br />Hey guys. I have had this charging case for about two months now it's been great. I love the colorway it comes in(white/gold or black/silver). Also, so far it has been a very durable case. I have dropped it accidentally a few time and there has not been one scratch on the phone. Also if your phone is dead you can charge it back about 70-80% up. But the reason I wouldn't totally five stars this is because the case battery takes up an extremely long time to charge completely. I'd say your phone will last a whole day. Thx"
