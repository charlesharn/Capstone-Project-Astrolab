Great for price!
Cheap quality and does not fit phone.
"Sound quality is pretty good (heavy on the bass). They pinch my ears a bit, so if you have a larger head they might not be for you."
Heavy duty cable that works with my iPhone 5s. Will buy again.
Received product fast and as described
Great fit. But pretty slippery.
"Worked great for 4 days. Then it wouldn't charge. Every time I tried to charge it, it would reset and just vibrate. Tried to contact the seller, but the language barrier made it all but impossible. Shipped on time and in good condition."
great Product.no instructions but look it up on YouTube
I was very satisfied with the delivery time and the product.
Like the phone. Still having trouble with downloading photos in messaging.
It's good quality but a little bulky.  I like something slimmer.  Still it's nice for the money.
"This case is an exceptional deal.  It fits our iPhone 6 and 5. I bought 3 of them for my family for vacation at the beach.  You can still make calls, text, and take photos while protecting your phone from sand and water. It comes with a cord to hand the phone around your neck...we vacationed in Europe and the case with the cord was extra protectioon from pickpockers.  The case is easy to use and will protect hour phone from water and spills.  A great product!"
"I received the headset as promised.  They were easy to charge, program, and comfortable to wear.  So far, I am happy with the purchase.  I would say that this is a &#34;good buy&#34;."
Nice product! As described & pictured.
"Love this charger cable! Charges my IPhone 6+ super fast. Durable cord, doesn't tangle. I have one that stays in my car and two in my house. Definitely a good buy!"
Works great!  Thanks
"I am giving this 5 stars. For the price, you can't go wrong and the sounds quality is really good. the base is deep, sound is crisp and you can hear everything clearly as if it was a wired set. This comes with different sized earbuds and they are comfortable. I think design and cord makes these very light and easy to wear during activities like bike riding, running, gym activities or casual wear. I tested the calls quality and I didn't hear any complaints. For the price and quality I would recommend."
The screen protector came with good instructions and a good little squeegee. It was easy to put on and didn't make a lot of air bubbles
Well this is the third intelliglass product that I have used.  Two for the galaxy note 4 and one for the wife's galaxy s5  all went on with out problems except for the first one on the note.  But it was my fault.  Looks clean and smooth.  S-pen glides over the screen.
"Only work minimal with direct sunlight.  Better use the old ways, open and close the car doors not completely about 10 or 20 times, temperature inside the car will reduce faster than using this.  Good exercise for you arms too."
thank you
pin pictured is not the correct pen.  It did not work on my device.  I had one like photoed and it worked.
I really loved the case. The case is almost addicting and I love the thickness of it. It holds really well on the phone.
Used it hiking over the summer. No problem charging my phone and other items. Wish they had changed the placement of the grommets so that the pouch could be shielded from the sun by the 1st solar panel. Still gets 5 stars.
A+++!!! Epic seller!!!
Worth every penny!
Would be 5 stars but the case is already lifting from the seal
"Product arrived on time, EXTREMELY well protected.  Ok, the box was the size of a toaster filled with those air cushions surrounding a lens smaller than a quarter...<br /><br />Seller says its OEM, but it sure doesn't look like the one I pulled out.  The dimensions are dead on.. perfect fit.. just visually it looks different than the one my phone came with.  There were 0 instructions on how to install it.. Looks like you pull the old piece, put in the double sided tape stuff inside the new one, pull the protective film off the lens, stick it in place, and re-install.  Fit was perfect.  I can live with it not looking identical.  The tools that shipped with, not a single one of them was the right size for the screws, again, no worries as I already have the right tools.  The little plastic pry thing was useful, and the only thing I'll keep from what it shipped with.  Good price, would be nice if they just had an option to buy the silicon lens and the adhesive though."
"Excellent phone, but overpriced here. Got mine (unlocked T-Mobile) at Bestbuy for $119.00. I hear they are very popular and folks can't keep them in stock. Maybe that why the price has gone up. Again, excellent phone.  Bought to replace my aging G3."
Arrived on time and works just great.  It is nice to have a similar holster option with out paying high wireless prices.  Fits just fine.
"Soooo glad I purchased! I bought this for a trip to  Mexico for me and my boyfriend. Super cheap way to go if you don't wanna do the whole go pro thing. We took underwater videos and they came out great! Enough room to put my galaxy s6 edge with a not so big case, money and hotel card. I put the money behind the hotel card to try and hide it. Definitely recommend this purchase."
"Nice Case, fits well and looks good."
"This cover is awful. The screen cover is gapped, and makes touch screen access awful. Stuff gets under the screen cover making a mess.... save your $  get a life proof."
Good case! Way better then the first one I bought for my phone. The first one didn't fit right and there wasn't a hard case!
Perfec
They are great at work.
"My order just came today - earlier than expected!!! Very nice case - just as described. Only negative comment I can make is about the magnetic closure flap - it feels a bit flimsy. But overall, I'm satisfied with this purchase. Phone can be charged while still in the case. You won't be able to find a phone case like this at your neighborhood mall selling at this great price!  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B010NFD0GC?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00"
Best armband I've owned!
"As good as the Samsung Galaxies, in my opinion."
"Came ahead of schedule absolutely love it! fits my phone great. Added a dust charm, definitely will shop with them again."
Nice!
"While the whole case is a little bulky, especially when it is in its clip-on holder, it is really perfect for me and this phone. I like the feel of the rubber on the sides and back, it is really non-slip. I like the edges reach over and create a lip on the front of the phone without losing any of the screen viewing area. And I use the belt clip holder everyday to carry my phone around. It is so much easier than fishing in my pocket for it. It does have a handy clip on the back of the phone case so you can prop the phone up, but I don't use that. Not having it might make the case just a little less bulky."
"Worked great, very durable."
Love love love 5 stars for sure
Extremely noisy. Zipper tabs rattle with every little bump. I have the iPhone 6 but this case is big enough for the plus.
"I really like these headsets, the fit well, and sound really good, the problem is that both pairs I ordered had the same problem, after a bout two weeks of use, they stopped taking a charge resulting in about five minutes of use when powering them on. Too bad."
Good.
"My first smart phone, and I absolutely love it. Real Android (5.1.1 as of last update), great screen, good call quality (all cellphones aren't that good), excellent connectivity on WiFi and 4G. Works GREAT with Cricket Wireless. I get 4G LTE in strong signal areas, HSPA in my home which has a fair to poor signal. Calls always go through just fine, even in my low signal home.<br /><br />I selected Cricket Wireless as my carrier, and bought the BYOP kit from Amazon. Works great, but read the caution below. Solution is to make sure you buy a MicroSIM kit for BYOP.<br /><br />The only caution is that the box has an icon showing Micro SIM OK, nanoSIM Bad!. Googling this, I found that the electrical contacts for the SIM slot can catch on NonoSIM to MicroSIM adapters if the SIM card is removed. This is the case for me, since I chose Cricket Wireless (ATT Prepaid) as my carrier. Since I don't intend to remove the SIM, it isn't a big problem. Knowing about the problem, should I need to remove the SIM (to change carriers, for example), I will need to take care extracting the Cricket NanoSIM. You can google the method, which is not complicated, and is essentially slipping a very thin piece of plastic (like screen protector plastic) into the SIM slot before gently removing the NanoSIM"
Great !
"Stopped working after 2 months, will no longer charge iPad.  Pay the extra money and buy a better cable, Do not buy this item, it will be a waste of money."
Its a great product.  I already own several.  I purchased this one because I wanted a lighter weight one to carry on a daily basis.  Its not much lighter then the bigger ones I own.  Not enough to make a difference.
Beautifully designed but doesn't work. Only thin cases will slide into the holder and forget about the watch staying in place. It constantly slides off causing the connection to fail. No response from company about the problem.
"Was a gift for my dad for Christmas, and he loves it!"
I have an older Sony TV in my bedroom and this Bluetooth transmitter extends it's lifetime for a few more years. Thank you for such a great product and the follow up after sales.
Very happy with my selfie stick. Came on time and is perfect for my vacations!
"i bought this for my iPhone 6 last year and within a month, dropped the phone. The screen protector cracked but my screen was fine. Tech armor quickly sent me a new screen protector, free, no hassles. Recently dropped my phone again cracking the protector. Quickly got a replacement for free!  I drop my phone a lot and the screen protector doesn't even scratch. I now have one on my iPad and the kids iPads. I especially like the anti-glare/anti-fingerprints for those. I will never use another brand!"
This works exactly like it's suppose to. Simple device and simple job. :)
This is a MUST for any Power User of Smartphones or tablets!
This case fits perfect and offers great protection.
Product didn't work waste of money
This was the first SPECK product that I bought.  Best phone cover ever.  Phone is protected from all sides.  I have dropped my phone a number of times in the garage and phone bounces.
"I received my case with high hopes for it. I was thoroughly disappointed by the fact that the inner cover didn't even fit my iPhone 6, and the snaps didn't get snap on the bottom so there was a gap. Because there is a built in screen protector, this gap made it impossible to type without pressing ridiculously hard. I can hear the popping noise whenever I tap my phone screen as if the built in screen protector is being pushed back in. Not to mention, the screen protector came damaged with a smear that I can't get out no matter how vigorously I rub it with a electronic screen cleaning wipe. Very disappointed with the touch sensitivity/fit and will return this item."
It's the real deal.  Don't settle for a cheap charger that last two months.  This one does not flicker or lose connection.  You won't be disappointed.
"I am forever forgetting to charge my cell phone, and nw, no matter were I am, I can charge it..  Stays charged for more time then all the others I checked out....  thanks."
great
Not worth it
"I love this watch, my friends were complimenting me when they see the watch, am so happy with it and good customer service."
Unfortunately it didn't work with my Galaxy S4 phone; so I had to return it. Instead I purchased the Samsung S4 battery case with the wireless receiver already attached and it works like a charm!
Great case for the money! I would definitely buy this again!
I absolutely love this case. The quality is amazing.
"I love this case. It fits perfectly and holds the phone in securely. The only thing missing is a belt clip/protective front cover which if included would make this the perfect rugged case for the Moto G. I don't use my &#34;phone&#34; as a phone. I purchased it for the sole purpose of using it as a backup camera and a link for a Sony action camera so I can use it as a viewfinder. I needed a rugged case that would take some abuse while out in the boonies and this thing delivers. It has a secure grip when my hands are wet and dirty and has taken a few good drops without issue. I do wish it had a front protective covering so when it's in a back pack or bouncing around in the jeep the screen itself would be protected. I did purchase another brand case which came with the belt clip/front cover. Come to find out this MoKo case holds the phone in much more securely and is built a bit tougher so I am just using the front cover from that other case on this one. MoKo, if you read this, please make a front cover/belt clip to go along with this case and I'll buy it. I don't even mind spending more for it since that would make this the perfect combination for the Moto G."
"After only a couple weeks after I purchased this phone, blue dots appeared on the camera, and I have no way of contacting the seller about it"
This bluetooth headset is working good. i am able to get a perfect fit for maximum sound quality. Bluetooth easily paired with my iPhone 5. Best
My husband loves it!!
I love it yay
Great case for the price!!!
Great screen protector.
"Cute,  convenient, inexpensive,  protective ....  BUT doesn't last long.  Had the case  for about 4 weeks when it started looking really worn out and cracking where is bends when you open it. Then after 8 weeks the seems completely ripped through where the wallet part is so it won't hold money or cards. I never overstuffed it or anything.  I'll probably order another because the price is right but as far as quality it definitely doesn't compare to the otterbox wallet case"
"It took a bit to figure out a place to put it on my dash, but now that it's placed. I love it."
"Bought this to take with my to sporting events when I want to make sure I have battery life and don't want to carry a ton of stuff around with me. This certainly fits the bill! Fits in my purse, and I've had it a month (and taken it to 4 games) and haven't had to charge it other than the first charge yet! I plan on charging it before this weeks game just in case, but I bet it would last without it!"
Only the mouse worked on me... Keyboard won't work...
They covered my Ipod that broke w/in a yr
"This is a VERY nice setup for the price. The flexible arm is strong and stable, and the suction cup locks solid on a smooth surface. If I had any complaint at all, it would be that you only get 1 clip per pack. I bought 2 of them so I could have a couple clips. Using mine to hold a HTC M8 with a case, so it opens wide."
"I have said this before and I will say it again, you can never have enough selfie sticks because a family member or friend will always try to &#34;borrow&#34; it. This selfie stick is awesome because it can be used using your headphone jack or with Bluetooth. You do have to charge it when you get it. I like that it comes with a waterproof carrying bag and I won't have to worry about it gettting damaged if I'm walking in the rain with it. Its small enough to fit in a purse and come on girls we all need one in our purse. The only problem I had with it was that I had a hard time trying to extend it. Other than that it didn't have any other issues and worked really good.<br />*I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
I love it becuase i don't have leave my phone sitting away from me i move with it now
"Paired easliy with my iphone, and ipad.  Just need to make sure you are not covering the lights on the button to let you know what you are doing.  Comfortable and secure in the ear, but I have not tried to run with them."
"I have had these for a couple of months.  No problem pairing them with my Windows phone.  The volume buttons work well.  A little tricky though, as it will skip to the next song if you are not careful when using the volume buttons  (the manual tells you this).  I use them mostly when doing yardwork and they are plenty loud enough even with the lawn mower on.  I have had some problems when mowing, with the phone in my pocket, where the headphones cut out occasionally if there is some jostling, but not usually very often.  They are comfortable and stay in pretty well.  The track skipping feature works with online music apps as well, which is convenient.  Well worth the price I paid."
"It works it charges my phone, its cheap enough and looks decent, its hard to find high quality accessories for anything not an iPhone, which is a little bit of a head scratcher for certain Android flagship phones like docks with speakers and high quality cases specifically I've been looking for a waterproof case for my galaxy note 4 none of the big names make one, but they have several for each gen iPhone.<br />Wow this one got off topic quick, bottom line this dock fits and works not the most elegant but more then suitable for what I need it for."
Not Good
Very simple to use and very reliable. Reasonable price as well.
Looks great. But it doesn't stay on well. If you drop your phone it breaks appart and falls of the phone. Its more for looks I guess. Which is fine with me. The HTC one m8 is pretty durable itself so I'm sure it I'll be okay.
Great Product. Just what I expected.
Perfect fit for my iPhone 6+ and Apple Watch. Apple Watch charger fits exactly and with no fuss and iPhone is more than secure. I completely recommend 100% buying this if you are in the market for an Apple Watch stand.
Does its job... With putting it on my OCD self makes it harder than it really is! i like how there are multiple protectors for 3rd times a charm and for future savings
Great product I really was inpressed with packaging
"This is the best phone case. Despite not being bulky, it absorbs shock when I drop my phone (even on the hard sidewalk) and nothing has broken yet! It fits perfect but isn't too difficult to take off if you need to. It feels good and looks great on my white phone (although that being said, it does show dirt easily, but I just wipe it regularly). Highly recommended!"
Dose what it supposed to do holes  my watch and phone so they can charge
"Works great, what else can I say?"
Everything was great. Thank you.
"I have trusted OtterBox for as long as I can remember; however, I have become addicted to LifeProof over this last six months. I guess I liked the clear case and slick look. Nonetheless, when I put this case on my Galaxy (work-phone), I remembered why I LOVE OtterBox. Not only is it fairly professional looking (it is a pretty basic, simple looking case), but it really is like encasing your phone in safety!<br />This case WILL hold up to a serious drop, it will (obviously) protect your phone from scratches and scuffs, and it will give it a pretty cool, polished look.<br /><br />LifeProof is PRICY. And, when I put this on, I realized that OtterBox is slightly better for everyday use than LifeProof (unless you are a devout hiker or outdoors person ... then, LifeProof might be the way to go).<br /><br />So highly recommended!"
Very difficult to get on the phone.  The volume turn on/off did not work.
"Like many other reviews, my set will not hold a charge after about a month of use. When they worked they sounded great &#60;assuming my phone was close enough to send\receive signal&#62; for music. I did get the audio drop out here and there when I was biking but it was never anything too bad or that would require a reparing. Forget about using these for a phone call since no one could ever hear me clearly when trying to use the built in microphone. Unfortunately now I get to throw these away because I am not able to charge the battery. Save your money and buy something that is better quality."
"After use, break from usage and unrepairable."
I love the design just not sure how long it will last
Very Happy With This Product
Works perfectly and was a great price
This is perfect! Exactly what I needed. This way I get the case I want and I still have a place to hold cards. It's very strong and staying in place. I highly recommend it.
Great product! Just as described.
"Initial review after having this Kinivo for 48 hours?  This has been what I've been searching for the last few years trying to use a system to sync up my calls and music.  I've used the motorola tx550 (terrible), Satechi Soundfly BT, and numerous other failed devices.  I was not only able to set this up in literally under a minute, I was later able to completely hide all the wires under my dash which made me even happier.<br /><br />I will periodically update on this device."
"Excellent, great product and his quality has wonderfull"
"Excellent quality of stand and packaging, well made, included lightning cable built in, which was a pleasant surprise.<br />Would buy again and strongly recommend.<br />Just waiting for watchOS 2 so I can use nightstand mode on the Apple Watch while charging, stand should be compatible with feature based on the angle it is held at."
"After reading other reviews I didn't want to invest my 7.00, but thought I would take a chance, I liked the brown leather look. But to my surprise I really like it, will buy again if need be. So far I have no complaints really glad I bought it."
After getting one of the brand's other product and decided to get another because of the good experience. This is a good product that give it a good boast. I use it every time I am on vacation or hiking. Give it a shoot.
This is no good at all. Within a week it lost its strength and never held up well anytime at all.<br />Don't bother buy this product.
Good quality
Excellent product excellent delivery
"Amazing product, completely water resistant. Took it on a family vacation and got it wet and my phone was intact, dry. Got lots of people asking me where I got it from. Would recomend to everyone!"
A+
Nice but back clip broke after a few months.
Love it!!!
Very cute! Love it!
Works Google
"Everything about using these screen protectors was disappointing.  I've used several other brands in the past, and never had the problems I've had with this one.  The cloth that came with this was the lintiest (if that's a word) cloth I've ever used.  This is the only screen protector I've used where my phone always looks filthy.  And it's not just the fingerprints (each one stays forever); it just looks dirty.  I haven't had any problems with it sticking like some others have mentioned.  It just never applied well and it's useless to me because the screen looks like such a mess all the time."
Didn't fit
"Works as intended, I should probably stock up on these as I tend to loose them quite frequently."
Cable is a bit short as it says but it does the job.
I recieved a discount on my order for a fair review
It arrived defective
"This is sleek and very well packaged. I'm happy with the quality of this product all around. I am thankful to have received this product at a discount for my honest review. What a great way to charge your phone. The future is now and this is an awesome example. My sister in law has the samsung galaxy s6 and I gave this to her. It charges her phone perfectly. This looks great on any night stand. Easy to use too. It has a grip to keep your phone in place and charges through her case. This makes life so easy. You just drop it and walk away to come back to a fully charged phone. No more hassle with finding a charger cable before bed. Just like the samsung commercials, this is a game changer. You don't have to have the newest phone to use it either if you buy a Qi adapter for your current phone. Worth every penny and full price is a great value."
Good fit
Better battery performance than the OEM Samsung batteries.
I just got it today (very quick delivery) & it fit just right & it is sturdy so far & has a good grip & the design is 100% how it looks in the picture c:
very pleased with this  product. i purchased this cover from a different company in pink. great protection and very durable
Perfect fit. Classy.
Inexpensive and serves its purpose.
Love it!
"I use this on my patio and also indoors. It's a great, easy to operate bluetooth speaker."
Great case. Protective without being bulky.
Worked great and lots of compliments!
Great product but beware it is not NFC or wireless charging friendly.
"Seeing how there aren't very many waterproof cases out for the note 4, I decided to give this one a shot. First off, I chose this product cause it looked better than the other options available on the market.  Out of the box: it's a nice looking case with decent cut outs (could've made the boarders less thick to allow edge-to-edge accessibility, but there's another draw back to this that's pointed out later on), foam and rubber parts were nice, back kick  stand is a little tough to get out but is a very nice addition, the rubber notification cut out was a definite plus for me.  Testing: alright, so taking apart the case is slightly rough but the snapping when you close it is oh so satisfying. The water test went fine; put a piece of paper in the case, sealed it off, submerged it under water for an hour, shook off the water, opened it up and the paper was still dry. The bubbles that come out of the bottom speaker vent is normal. Had no issues with watching videos and audio being muzzled. Only my OEM charger would fit, which they state somewhere in the papers along with screen protector usage being ill advised when paired with this case (found this to be true).  Conclusion and why I'm giving it a two star rating: it was a great product when I used it for all of a week but decided to take it off and the corner of the front panel, above the s pen door, broke. On that note, the mechanism that opens for the s pen access is EXTREMELY weak and a little pressure on it will open it. As I need to constantly open the case to swap out the battery for a fresh one, this may have considerably weakened the case, but this shouldn't be to the point where a corner cracks open due to it. I wanted to like the case, but you really get what you pay for and it's not the best long term product to go with."
"Not sure if this will fit my 2000 Grand Prix gtp. It is a 1.5 din, but the air vents stick out about 1.5&#34; from the face of the current radio. Not sure if the screen will be able to open all the way?"
Love it!
"These work well, but one had a defective battery compartment latch. I am using a rubber band to keep it closed."
"I used these on two new phones.  The cut was precise, and they went on easy.  Can't beat the price.  I just hope I never have to find out if they protect as well as the big $$$ brands."
I purchased two of these. Neither of them stay clicked in nicely like the original one that came with my phone. They constantly fall out while charging. It leaves me to believe that these are not authentic Samsung products.
"Mophie chargers are excellent but this case is not.  I've owned two and in each case, the plastic belt clip has broken after a month or so of very normal use, dropping the phone to the floor in each instance.  The first instance was a few years ago and I foolishly assumed that this product would have been improved and bought a second one.  My mistake.  The shortcomings of the plastic fittings make this product unworthy of your purchase."
Great product.. Honestly worked great in my side by side.
"I've had this case for 2 months. I've taken it out the case at most 2x. I love this case its durable and it's saved my phone from many drops. It has a smooth backing to it. It will slide off all surfaces when placed on its back. The silicone piece does grip to some surfaces when phone is placed face down. I haven't lost any of the diamonds and the color hasn't gotten darker from wear and tear. My only down side is I already need to replace it because the silicone has stretched out. I wish the hard plastic wasn't just covering the sides because it may have prevented the top and bottom from stretching out so much. The stretching does cause the phone to loosen out of the phone case all together, which in turn has made me have to take my phone out and put the case back on correctly more often. Annoying! I guess 2 months of durability and low cost out weights the slow painful death of my precious phone case."
I had these for 3 days and the remote to control the volume and to pause and play the music did not work the cord is very bad as well.
The cases arrived quickly and were exactly what I expected. Good colors and fit snug. Not a lot of protection if it drops but it's enough for me. I would buy this brand again for my next phone.
Perfect but it's hard to turn the phone on because the button on the case is hard to push.
Excellent!!!!
Nice and sturdy.
"I had been using another VERY popular case, but the plastic at the bottom kept breaking when i was pulling the phone out of my pocket.  This one is much more robust in the bottom, and has the same look, feel, and function as the other one except the back is plastic instead of the rubber.  My other case was wrapped in rubber with just a plastic ring around the edging.  This one is wrapped in rubber with a complete plastic backing and some on the sides.  It is much less prone to breaking.  Bonus, my phone actually looks like an iPhone with this case too.  haha  I am happy."
Battery has worked fine after several months of light/moderate use in a standard (non-Smart) cell phone.  Price was great and I am not disappointed in the capability of this slim Samsung battery at all.  Younger &#34;power users&#34; might think otherwise.  It takes a charge as quick as the day I bought it and will go days in between charges (with light use) which is something my Kyocera cell can't do with a fresh Chinese knock-off battery. OEM parts sometimes pay off.  I know it does with my camera batteries.  Just sayin....
its okay product
Like it a lot!
Awesome product
"Very poor quality.  Case fits, but is not snug on my iPhone 5c.  Color and design is wearing/scratching off after just 2 days of use.  I guess you get what you pay for."
It does not provide enough power for iPad. I am disappointed
Good
Didn't work for my lg g3 at all. Screen would not activate on case was on. Case looked sturdy by was useless to me because it didnt allow my phone to work
"While I understand the reasons for giving low ratings for this product, I can't say that I agree with the fact that they are given.  When you buy this mp3 player just know what you're getting into.  It is a very simple interface, simple design, do not expect frills and thrills, but for $25 bucks what do you expect.  I went to Target and Wal-mart to find the cheapest mp3 player possible that had at least mediocre reviews, and the most cost effective one I found that didn't receive total garbage ratings was in the area of $40+ dollars, and it was in area of 3 out of 5 stars with users experiencing similar problems which is not something anyone likes to see.  I will admit that the controls and interface are a bit confusing at first, but nothing that I couldn't figure out after a day or two of use, and while you can toss a sim card in this player, it comes with 16 gigs and if you just use it for music, estimating an average song is about 3 to 5MB, you can fit somewhere in the range of 3,200 to 5,300 songs.  Definitely wouldn't recommend that many though if you're someone who likes to search for a particular song though.  Sound is surprisingly good, and can actually get pretty loud depending on your headphones.  For my own purposes, I get inexpensive mp3 players to take to the gym so its not a big deal if something happens to it and I usually have about 100 to 150 songs at a time so this player for me is perfect.  To sum up, I feel like you get much more than your moneys worth for a very basic product.  Keep your expectations tempered and expect at least a little interface confusion to start.  Personally I'm probably going to buy a couple more in case something happens to the one I have so that I have a backup for when I inevitably drop something heavy on it."
"Unfortunately this has the halo effect around the edges where the glass is to big and goes over the curves of the screen, which i did not mind the look of because it was such a nice feeling protector. BUT this lifting of the edges allowed dust/sand to get in under the glass, and cause it to get several cracks that crossed the screen after only a few days. Skinomi says they have lifetime replacements, but i filled out one of their claim forms on their website, and after a month of no response, i sent another. Still no response. As far as i can tell, their customer service is non-existent, two months of waiting and nothing. Extremely disappointed in this company, and a waste of money."
"Beautiful case for iphone 6 plus. Great fit with some corner protection around the phone. It's a hard case with a very nice sheen finish to it, and I love the Disney tsum tsum prints which is very nicely printed. Definitely a plus for Disney tsum tsum lovers."
This is one of the most fragile phone cases I've come across in recent memory. There are 4 connector that connect the plastic gel case to the outer shell at all r corners and all but one of the connectors broke. The paint chips off very easily and now the case looks very warn even though it's only a few months old.<br /><br />There are some good things about the case though. Kick stand is convenient. There's also a nice padding on the back of the phone case that protects the s6 camera lense that sticks out more than most camera lenses. Would be a great phone case but I don't know how long it's going to last.
"[[VIDEOID:fcf2bdb3f1d37e2781470efc47fde6cc]]What a great leather wallet styled case!<br />It looks slim like a wallet style.<br />I easily inserted the phone into the case without a problem.<br />On the left flap, there are pockets to hold my driver license, credit card as well as some cash.<br />I can also use the case to stand my iPhone6. It is a quick and easy way to watch movie or do video chat.<br /><br />It looks great. My iphon6 is hidden well inside the case. Very cool!"
Product works great. Just as promised.
Great product. All my friends have on just got my code getting mine.
Didn't like it
"Great, bought it for my wife and she loves it. Only down side is the cord it comes with to allow for charging does not fit her iphone 5 (or my 4 for that matter) maybe it is a plug for the iphone 6. Great overall."
It makes my Iphone look nice!
Directed electronics is very vague with info on install instructions but if you can figure it out this is a breeze to install. Just a few connections and your done.
Beautiful design and fast shipping!
Works!!
"Love this. It does exactly what I want this type of thing to do, just basic activity and monitor my posture. I have been wearing it since I purchased it in August 2015 and enjoy receiving the reminders for posture and information on my goal achievement for steps and posture. I did not want an activity monitor to wear on my wrist. The Lumo Lift is very unobtrusive and I appreciate that it does not announce the fact that I am monitoring my posture or counting steps. The options for dressing it up are nice but I use the basic silver and black."
Very durable. Strong case!
"Super! Used it constantly for over a year now, it's traveled weekly and still kicking"
"The tablet is great. Lollipop is not; yet.  Stay on Kitkat  until  LG puts the upcoming Lollipop update through (5.10). It runs 5.02 right now. If your tablet wants to upgrade from KitKat, learn from my mistake, and dont' let it.. If you install Lollipop before the update, your tablet will &#34;leak&#34; memory. Music stops in the middle of a song (imusic player is Google Play) , keyboards crash making it so you can't type, and apps continually stop and then relaunch, slowing everything down. Trying to have 2 apps open in the same window is useless. I'll post back here once LG puts the update through."
"I've ordered multiple sets of these cables, to replace various USB charging cables that have worn out and stopped working.  These cables have solid construction and good connection when plugged in.  So far no problems with connector failure due to strain at the plug end.  Excellent value."
Perfect
Everything worked out great! good shipping.it arrived the day they said(it came early in the day)<br />It works witht-mobile.you just have to buy a sim card. But it comes with a charger and to my suprise some headphones that sound great.
For the money you won't find a better case for your phone.
Excellent Cell phone charger
"This far exceeded my expectations of the quality for the price!  And the seller shipped extremely quick.  It has a built-in screen protector that I worried wouldn't be as responsive as a sticky film protector, but it has been great.  My eight year old has been the one using this, and no complaints from her either.  The stand stays out of the way pretty well, but is also removable (and can be used on either side) and since it wasn't a feature she was using, we just took it off completely.  The silicone is thick and durable with extra padding on the corners - I think it should protect it from most drops.  The color is a true red and very attractive."
Works as intended
Gift
"The layers in which the phone is inserted, make it very difficult to remove it from the holster. The layers automatically snap off from the phone, making it much too hard, to quickly remove the phone from it's holster and answer calls. This holster case is good to protect the phone from minor damages; however I don't recommend it as a phone belt holster. Additionally, I received it late and with no user instructions.<br />I'm very unsatisfied with this &#34;Holster Case.&#34; I Don't Recommend it."
"I wouldn't but it again, is nothing like the picture show, cheap material, I was disappointed"
"Works great!  Very clear reception, and good enough distance (picks up about 15-20 feet away)"
Just not a great bluetooth headset. I found it hard to hear the players
The case is slipping from the holder it came with.
"Sounds good, backup works well, like it.<br />The bad:<br />Backup does not work while reading ad card.<br />Cannot adjust settings while playing music.<br />Display does not dim when night falls."
Love this!
just junk.
"I researched for awhile before settling on a case. I previously bought a water proof case for an HTC one that was terrible. This case is great. Fits the note 4 perfect. It may not be completely water proof, but it definitely feels resistant. The S pen can still be accessed. Good product!"
Excellent Bluetooth for the price.
"Pretty sturdy, I'd buy it again!"
Looks just like real wood
"Awesome product, very durable."
Right after I was accepted for the review I got my calling card credited to my account and the card works great. Would recommend to anyone
these work great and have great sound.
Took a few tries to get the ear pieces properly fitted.<br />A bit of a thump thump as you run.  Not too overbearing though.
"Quick delivery. Item as described, easy to install 10/10."
"Its an amazing case, works really nice underwater!"
"They're awesome!  Easy interface, and stay in my ears very well."
"First choice out of all our headsets because they are small, lightweight, and swivel for either ear, but they break VERY easily. The pin that holds the ear piece together snaps off and they are rendered useless after only a few uses."
Works exactly as advertised. Very good product.
Its nice product
GREAT FIT!! GREAT QUALITY!! GREAT PRICE!!.. THE CASE CAME IN SOONER THAN EXPECTED TOO:)
"True to color. And the best part is its made out of a good material. It's very durable. I always drop my phone, so this case helps me many times so I didn't have to get a new phone."
"I really like this product for charging several devices at once: iPhone, Kindle HD and Kindle reader.  I've tried other products similar to this that would not charge or were very slow.  This one does the job. I've very pleased."
"Within the first week I lost two screws, the material that covered the ports started ripping/tearing and EVERYONE had a hard time hearing me if I talked in any position other than by my hand (i.e. my sholder). I really thought I'd found a great cover but I wish I hadn't wasted the ! $."
"I’ve been seeing these all over the news about how these are really popular in Asia and wanted to try one out. This thing is amazing and has revolutionized how we take photos, I LOVE monopods. It arrived in nice blue packaging. This selfie stick is black and works exactly as advertised. You hook up your phone via audiojack and place it in the holder. Click and you’ve taken a pic! Initially, I was worried that it was so light, it was flimsy. But once you put your phone, you realize they did that on purpose and it helps to reduce the weight. Button works perfectly and I like the sleek design. My phone fits well, but I always have my phone in a case, just in case something happens. We took this on a trip and it was so convenient just taking this and my phone, instead of lugging around our DSLR. No more bothering strangers for bad pictures and we can get the whole family in the pic! You might feel funny about using a monopod, but when we went to Europe, everyone was using them because they really are great! Totally recommend!<br />*Honest review for discounted product*"
Stopped working after about 2 weeks.
easy to hold and seems to protect the phone.  looks quite nice
"Cute, but doesn't come up around sides to protect front if dropped."
ok
Very good
Worked as advertised
Love it.  Only thing I could do with out is the bright blue LED light that flashes when my phone is on the unit.
Great stylus to use. Most stylus last about a week with me but this one have been use months and still as new as the day I got it.
"High quality, protective cover. Very convenient for carrying along ID, etc. Love it!"
The product  was delivered as stated in the product description
"Installation was very easy, I just followed the instructions it came with and went on flawlessly. Would buy again if this one breaks or I get a new phone."
Works great!
"Do not charge my phone,"
I love this case...especially the fact that it wraps all the way around to the edges. The graphics are clear and look quite good.
This works well and has kept me charged up over some multi day hiking trips.  But for some reason recently just one charge of my iPhone drains the battery pack almost completely.  Not sure why that's happening.
Beautiful case! Love it!
Very good! Works as expected. This was the only charger that worked for my LG G2 after the original charger shorted out.
I used this cable for about six weeks and than it just stopped workin. I have tried it on different device multiple time since than but no result.  It was very difficult for me to believe that $15 iPhone cable will just stop charging so soon.  by the way I take a good care of my electronics and the cable had no visual damages so it may have been defective or just my luck.
Works really well.
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
"Didn't like it.  Sleeve was slightly loose around my phone, and it was difficult to get in and out of the holster.  I got a different one after about a week."
Fits perfectly. the kick stand comes in handy for videos.
Just what I needed for my daughter whose phones' cables break down fast. And it's inexpensive in comparison with the original ones.
My old USB plug in overheated and warped plug in. Phone wouldn't even turn on. I thought my whole phone was dead since it wouldn't turn on. Installed this and was able to charge phone again and phone works great now! I also have no mic issues like some had. Install was fairly easy too. Thanks!
"This is a great pair of headphones for any kind physical activity. Took it out on a long run today, stays perfectly in place and you do not have to fiddle with it every time the buds get sweaty. I like the piece that goes behind the ear. Its very subtle and lightweight so, you do not have anything bothering you.<br /><br />The cable has a plastic covering. Which protects it from the sweat. Currently, the cable is not very flexible, but I loosens up a bit.<br /><br />The sound quality is great for the money you pay! As i mentioned, great headphones for the outdoors. Must buy, if you like good quality headphones at an affordable price."
Item as specified.
After 2 days the minions started to fade in appearance. I guess the heat from my fingers and from the phone in general caused this to happen. This case needs to be made of different material. It was nice for 1 day.
Works perfectly to protect my phone!
A+++
Works great
Product as described.
This &quot;Pocket charger&quot; is awesome it will charge my tablet fully in half the time it takes on the wall!
"Pretty good case but I feel that when I put my screen face down it will still get scratched, there's not a lot of room between the screen and the table. But gorgeous case. Design hasn't scratched off(yet)"
Excellent charger. Great price. Charges both my fire phone and my kindle.
"Great case at a great value!  Slimmer than the Otterbox case, but just as protective.  Some slight rainbow effect from screen saver, but you can only see it when the screen is off.  Rainbow is not visible when the screen is on."
"Excellent product, very sturdy and appears that it will not fall apart quickly like others!"
"This phone is absolutely terrible! It states that it is designed for use with AT&T...<br /><br />Okay, well first off, it is set for using up to 2 SIM cards, but the IEMI numbers do not match watch actually comes through in their system (they chronically think that it's a NOKIA). Second, straight from the factor the internal settings (VPN, APN, etc.) are entirely incorrect, even after cycling through two different SIM cards from AT&T. The phone never achieved 4G status (see above) and AT&T could never track down a troubleshooting/diagnostics guide from the manufacturer - NOT SUPPORTED.<br /><br />Do NOT purchase this phone. The package insert is useless and there is no user's manual that covers any details other than how to screw the battery plate into place, how to insert a SIM card, and how to plug in your charging cord.<br /><br />By the way - the charging cord tip (the metal adaptor piece that inserts into your phone) is a custom job - it's longer (deeper) than any that you'll find in any store. This means that you cannot buy one anywhere for replacement. I had to buy one while on the road and was stuck using my pocket knife to whittle away some of the plastic so that it might reach in deep enough.<br /><br />Do NOT purchase this phone!"
love it
So far so good. All of the batteries works well for this note 4. No problems thus far.
"Spend the money; don't use the cheap wireless receivers; mine didn't work; but once I attached this case all is good.  This back cover does make the phone slightly bigger and it will not fit the Otter Box Commuter Series case, but it does fit the Otter Box Preserver Series case & my Lockproof case; plus it allows you charge with the case on."
"Just received mine. The build quality is excellent. You have 2 options to secure a piece of ferromagnetic metal to your phone, a small disk or a rectangle that is thinner and smaller than a credit card. These can be attached with peel and stick adhesive or placed between your phone and your case. I chose the latter, since I have a simple Belkin case on my iPhone. The device fits securely into my air vent, and the magnetic force is adequate. No problems to report."
Is not genuine. Korean imitation!!
All cables worked well with my set up. Speaker wire could've been a little bigger like 12 gauge instead of the provided 18&#34; gauge speaker wire
Had this for 2 weeks and its not charging my phone anymore
"This product works as intended to protect my phone's screen. The only downside is that it doesn't completely adhere in the edges and after a few months of use it stars looking really bad. Dirt is deposited between the edges where this doesn't adhere to the class and becomes imposible to completely clean, so the only solution is to change the protector for a new one. On other phones and electronics, screen protectors seem to last much longer. This might just be the way the phone is curved, but I think the screenprotector could be designed to cover a little bit less area and that way the edges will stick better."
"Fixed my daughter's phone (for the 2nd time) using the Sellicase kit.  Worked like a champ, but would definitely use one of the YouTube videos.  There are a couple that have a template with them for the various parts (especially the small screws).  Makes the job much easier.  Phone's working like new now!  Would buy again...if needed."
Pretty good for a cheap little case. Doesn't protect much but it was more for looks than protection. The pink is a litttttle but more dark than in the picture but I think it's because in the picture it's on the white phone and mine is gray.
"Don't bother buying this! Left ear piece works, right ear piece does not!!"
"They are ok, wish it had a longer battery life. Needs to be charged constantly!"
"On time, work perfectly out of the box, friends say sounds great."
Great case!  I love it.  I've dropped my phone several times and it's held up great.
Not much more to say. I love it!
Not an accurate description...  they are transparent and flimsy
Mines stop working in a week
works as advertised.  we power our mini iPads and iPhones and have not had a problem
Great case! I like how slim it is while still feeling like it provides a fair amount of protection.
works very well for sailboat
Good
Wonderful way to charge my new Nexus phone.  Charges the phone without the need to remove the clear plastic case. Great value!
"I love how simple it was to install and I appreciate how well it holds my phone.  My last car phone holder required that I place it in some arms that then clicked to hold it tight.  It was a pain to grab my phone.  Basically, putting it in or taking it out of the holder was a pain.  Not the case here.  It's a powerful magnet and you simply place your phone on it and it stays there.  Then when you want to grab it, it just comes with you when you grab it.  I did receive this product as part of a product promotion, but now that I've been able to try it out, I'm ready to buy another for my other vehicle!"
Pretty cool. What I was expecting
"This is a great charger to use in your car, and I really like that is has 2 ports, so both my husband and I can charger our phones at the same time.  I also like that it has an air purifier on it as well.  I can't really say how well that works as I don't have any way to test the actual ability to provide clean air, thought I am hoping it helps with my asthma and allergies.  Either way, it's ability to charge 2 items at the same time is great.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
"Item stopped working after 45 days.  Good idea, but poor execution on this particular cable."
"Perfect, I needed this for my car, everyone wants to charge their phone while driving, this out let made it possible."
"For the price of this case, you can't go wrong.  If you own an ATIV windows phone you know phone case choices are slim to none, so I have tried them all, and this is hands down, one of the best.  It is durable, pretty, effective and inexpensive.  This is a win-win purchase."
Great
Tough case
"Overall, I really like the band and seeing my steps thru the day is a great way to focus more on my fitness.  I am not sure that the sleep measurement is accurate.  Also, I hit the band on things sometimes due to being a little tall."
Wonderfull.
Easy to install and great detail!
Nice fit and good feel. Along with a screen shield my phone is fully protected!
fair
"Fast shipping, worked great and had some instructions on charging too!  Thank you"
Love it! Many compliments on it.
The only thing I was a little disappointed in was that it wasn't as bright as I thought it would be like in the picture.
This case is great! Its super slim and fits perfect and offers great drop protection.
Fits perfect! Great protection for a great price!
Great case
Works!
"Good, solid feeling case. I like the swivel clip. Fortunately I haven't actually put it through a drop test yet."
"Worked fine for 2 weeks, then bricked.  Got it mainly to help keep track of swimming laps.  Off by close to 100 yards plus or minus any given mile swim. Close enough.  Would eventually have tried the golf and Cycling features.  Now does not work at all. After charging it stuck in update mode all day and now nothing.   Update ... It mysteriously started working again after about 2 months.  Used it the rest of the summer for recording laps and it worked pretty well. also used it for steps and stationary bike a few times.  Now it just stopped recording steps when i walk or distance.  It will show distance as the crow flies from a starting point so basic GPS seems to be working.  It also displays time and date, but that is all. Will NOT connect to Garmin for updates."
"I got this for my wife when Amazon had it on sale.  I read a lot of bad reviews for many bluetooth hands-free car kits over the last couple months.  This one caught my eye because although there were only a few reviews, they were favorable overall.  I decided to give it a try considering the low price and considering the great Amazon return policy.  I installed this for my wife and routed the cables out of the way.  I paired it with her new iPhone and showed her how to control the unit.  She is a happy camper.  She is far from tech savy but she has no problem remembering and operating the simple controls.  The audio quality of the microphone isn't as great as my factory system but it really is good quality -especially considering the low cost.  The audio quality for streaming music from her phone is great and that is how the unit is used 99% of the time.<br /><br />We don't use the cigarette ligher USB adapter portion of the kit because I already bought her one that is much better quality.  That said, the one included with this kit seems to be good quality and that was a surprise.  She keeps it as a spare -just in case.  We are very happy with this unit and I am considering getting one myself.  My factory hands-free unit only supports calls over bluetooth and I want one of these to handle music streaming."
Great
"I was a little skeptical about purchasing a solar charger since I have never used one before...I am usually a positive person and try to make the best out of all the things I purchase on Amazon even if it turns out not how I wanted. But this product, solar charger in general has got to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever come by.  It does not charge at all! I was really disappointed and is in the process of returning it now.  Left it in the sun all day and not a single charge!?  It barely charged using the USB/wall charger(very slowly), but my purpose of getting it was to be able to use the solar.  I am taking a vacation trip to the villages of Laos/Thailand and I know most of the villages don't have wall chargers and so I was looking forward to using this to help charge my batteries for my go pro. But too bad it does not work and I don't think I'll be investing in any solar chargers for now on. Save your money and invest in a external battery power banks instead..."
Looks great; sturdy construct . Does its job ..
Best idea ever.  Especially on vacation and family reunions.
Husband love the length and sturdiest<br />Of cord
Magnet not stong enough to hold phone in it well enough.
"This speak is loud enough, even louder than I expected. So far it's working well. I am able to bring this speaker everywhere. Since the week I got this speaker, I wasn't needed to charge it for a week (got this last week). I like it so much."
"Great, but if you use wireless or NFC a lot, this will block those features since its made of metal."
Perfect fit for me.
Cheep and did not last
Once you use the case for a while it doesn't stay the same color and my white part is peeling.  Other then that it's a good case. But don't think I'll buy again
"This product is certainly better than having to figure out where to put my phone when I am doing turn by turn navigation.<br />The only issue that I have had is that it does block one of the main vents for air for the driver, but this I can manage do work around because I would much rather not have to find my phone on the floor or in my cup holder when its telling me where I have to turn next.<br />Overall a very good product.  Works well with my Samsung 6, Samsung 5 as well as an Iphone."
It's a nice touch especially with the Chevy cobalt...... Bought it for my boy friend.... Fits perfectly in 06'..... And a little cubby in the bottom...... Hands free
"Installed this last night. Followed a video on youtube and the install went perfectly. Screen looks like the original screen, from the LG logo and finish on the grey area at the bottom all the way to the perfect fit of the glass. If I didn't replace it myself I would think its the stock screen. The digitizer had no dead spots and seems to be very responsive. Screen looks clear and bright, I can't tell any difference in quality from the original. As long as it keeps working long term I will be very happy with this  purchase.<br /><br />Tools included were great, suction cup worked and made the job much easier, pry tool and guitar pick tool worked great. Only tiny complaint was that the screw driver end seemed too small, felt like it was going to strip the screws out, so I went and got a better quality little bit wider screw driver from my tool box and it worked great."
"Great device, works as described. It is very compact, and has reduced the mess in my desk considerably! Definitely recommended!"
I like it.
"Doesnt play audio by Bluetooth or jack.<br />Tried on several cars, nothing seemed to work.<br />All that works is the usb, no audio through usb either."
nice new item
"My wife loves it, but it didn't work well for my car"
That is a great Android cellphone I ever seen. Great experience!
"This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I've ordered several of these cases in different colors for multiple phones and I love the kickstand function. I ordered this one to keep at work so I can see the notification light while working without keeping the volume up. I like to use other cases that don't have a kickstand, so I'll be able to snap this on at work and change back to my other case for the rest of the time. I was a little disappointed that they charged $5 for shipping, when the case didn't even cost me that much. That being said, even though it wasn't sent to me from Amazon/Prime, I did receive the case extremely quickly."
"This case is awesome, full protection at a fraction of the cost"
Great products
Love it
"Love this case, got it as a gift for my Husband for his Birthday, He's so picky!! Hard to please and buy for, This is a very Nice case, Wish they had it in Pink or Purple sparkly girly something, that'd be cool! 😉"
This things is AWESOME. Fits great and it appears to be able to protect it no problem. I can even use my Samsung Wireless charger through it which I could not do with another style. Not having to take the case off every night to charge is a bg bonus. The kickstand appears to be metal in the photo. It is plastic. Still works but I fear the mechanism that holds (Plastic Bump) it into the case will wear out and the kickstand will become useless and have to be ripped off. We will see though.
ok
"Great sound for a small area, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, by the pool, on the beach etc. but for dinners and parties you need to go bigger."
"These are great screen protectors and you can't beat the price. I have been ordering these for the past 3 years for each of my mobile devices and they have protected them from scratching and every day wear and tear. The fact that it is glare proof also makes smudges less noticeable, which is always good! One thing to note however is that because it's glare proof there is an added layer, and it actually makes your screen slightly darker. You will also no longer be able to use your phone as a mirror, but you get what you ordered!"
My little sister loves it!!!
"we tried in a couple of places to program it butt no success, it s &#34;no &#34; for me"
"I bought it for the eventual EARTHQUAKE, when we lose power,  So far, it works very well (during testing...not an earthquake.)"
Can hardly hear the ringer and you can't change ringtones without purchasing a new one and the buttons are so small that big fingers hit more than one at a time.
"Charges 3 phones at rated speeds simultaneously. I charge my Moto X, iphone 5s, and zenfone 2 all with this adapter and it works great. It gets slightly warm put when putting out that much wattage you can't really expect it to not heat up a bit. I recommend this so much I bought two."
"This works good on the mirror mount on the handlebars .I noticed that on my FJR that it had a place to mount a mirror on the handlebars that was not used due to the mirrors being mounted on the faring . I just bought a 10mm x 1.25mm bolt and painted is satton black , I thought I would have to drill it out due to it being stated it was 9mm but it threaded right on . By the way this would work with the mirror still being used no need for a bolt then .  I'm not sure if it would work very well with 8 mm mirrors.<br />Larry"
"Cords are exactly as advertised, and truly are the perfect size for the DJI Inspire 1 with the factory device mount and the iPad Air 2! A++"
"I have an iPhone 5c and I specifically ordered it for my shape of phone and when it arrived, it was built for an iPhone 6. It sucked. The case was nice, though"
Grey and blue colors are very stylish and chic.  It gives my Samsung Galaxy phone a sexy new makeover. Cover is very sturdy. Made with durable materials which protect my phone from falls and other elements.  Case arrived with a hand held mirror in the storage compartment. You can store a credit/debit card or even an ID with the mirror or remove the mirror and store 2 cards.<br /><br />I purchased this case when I travelled out of the country so I can store my card in an inconspicuous yet safe location. I would highly recommend this product!
It's charge 50% of the cell phone battery which it's good
Great product durable
2nd one I have bought! Love these :)
Great product and so easy to install. Love it!
"I personally don't own an iPhone 6+ (let alone any iPhone), but I bought this as a gift for someone who couldn't make up their mind about which case to get. That being said, they were naturally happy to receive this case because it afforded them the quality of an OtterBox case to an extent without costing as much. What makes this case even nicer, is that it has swappable plates so he can change it depending on his mood."
"I bought this for my boyfriend who is a welder, so he obviously sweats a lot throughout the day. He still has it, uses it all day every day and loves it. He can hear it while he is in the weld shop, and it sits low enough on his neck it doesn't get burned.<br />I chose the black so dirt wouldn't show up like it would with the white (like I bought).<br />I have a different brand that is ~60 bucks less than this that I use at the gym. The Bluetooth capability on this one holds much stronger distance wise than mine does. I would recommend this over any other brand, any day, and he has recommended it to many of his friends as well who have purchased one."
"I never carry a purse any more - it's great!  This is my third one (for third phone upgrade), and except for the limited color selections I couldn't be happier."
"nice looking, holds phone well, stash a credit card and a few bills when going out!"
"I love the beautiful design and look, also protects the phone well, also ordered a silver one."
This case has great features. I love the colors and the kickstand.
Pretty good
"Thank , I really liked , shipping was fast ."
quality was good works as i was expecting<br />image quality was nice ill give it 8/10 for quality
"Two cables, both duds. Both had &#34;not charging&#34; message meaning they are likely not mfi certified as stated. Going back to Amazon. I never seem to learn my lesson that cheaper is almost always too good to be true."
I loved it
"Awesome phone.  Spyware/malware comes pre-loaded though.  If you don't mind having to root your phone and going into developer mode, than this is a great phone, especially for the price.  This phone competes well with Zen-Phone II, one plus one, and all other unlocked phones.  This phone is sweet. Everybody will be asking where you got it, with that bright yellow.  Also, 4g does not work with t-mobile in the United States.  I heard the 4g works with the AT&T."
Great headset sleek and sharp you'll love it.
Great product. Exactly as described. It fits very snug to my phone. Shipping fast as well
"Love this case, perfect fit, great material, great price! Exactly what I was looking for."
These are great ear phones. The only lack a clip so they will not slide from around your neck.
Delivered on time and in new condition. Fits perfectly and performs flawlessly.
"A very convenient item. The con is that it does not come with a USB-to-MicroUSB adapters, so I had to spend additional money in order to purchase that."
"Not the happiest with this item. If you have your phone in it and not in a plastic bag dirt, dust, lint, and anything else that might be in your pocket or anywhere for that matter gets inside and ruins your screen. I will say if it was improved on it could be a great product ! $20 bucks you def get what you paid for"
As advertised
It protect against falls and other mishaps one might experience while in your possession.
"It works great, except for the phone mic system. Probably better to buy the model without the hands free calling."
2 amp fast charger. Love it
"Great product, very comfortable to wear and very easy to configure, after pairing for the first time it connects super fast, I just have to turn the headset on and that`s it. I have asked people that I have called on how is the quality of the audio and they says that it is very clear I can hear them very clear as well. Shipping was super fast and I definitely recommend. great product for the price."
Working well thus far. Total bargain!!! We purchased these for our tablet and phones and it works well with both. It also works
Best Shower speaker for a great price!
The white part got brown within a week of using.  It wouldn't come off.  Threw my case away after two weeks because it looked so dirty.
Ordered just before trip. Easy to install. Works great if you find the correct placement of the antenna
"Best phone case I've ever owned, and classy. Only problem is the little band is made out of the same stuff as hair ties, and my band has entered the final stages of it's life. I recommend the magnetic one instead (Search for magnetic genuine oiled leather case for nexus 6)"
finger sensor doesn't work screen protector kept coming off horrible quality I wouldn't recommend cheaply made
Works well with lots of credit card and magnets hold very well.
"Battery life is great with this product. Doesn't take forever to charge like previous products I have had, and will last all day with HEAVY use. I can get 10-12 hours screen on time with this in a single day.<br /><br />The back the comes with this does feel a little cheap and that's the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. It can pop off really easy if you're not careful. It does make your phone about 3/4 inch thick and significantly heavier, but it's a good balance between the smaller capacity batteries and the REALLY big ones."
Good phone
great one i like it
"there is a scratch on the front screen and there are also two prominent bubbles, the back is nice though"
Fits my phone perfectly. Soft and keeps my phone protected
Used this to repair a cracked screen in a Asus Transformer T100. I've replaced a few screens before and this product is/was exactly what I needed. Put a line on both inner and outer edges and you are good to go. Always warm it a tad to seal the deal. Literally.
Great product at discount price. Seller delivered as listed.
Works as it says!
"Fits nicely, good video to follow"
"OtterBox.  Always a great option. Defender is bulky, but worth protection."
"Beautifully done. It's a little difficult to remove once it's installed. Feels a little flimsy...but it looks great, It probably doesn't provide any protection to the phone if it falls. Ships from China."
"The person who repaired my phone told me that if I drop it one more time it probably won't work. After hearing that I decided to buy this to be safe. It works really well, I have dropped my phone a couple times and no cracks. What I really like about this also is that it doesn't scratch so my phone looks like it's new."
Not as expected
"The only reason it's a 4 star rating because my cable failed after just two months, but I'm able to return it back for refund. I'm still an anker fan. I think I may have received the defective one."
Works
This cover cracked easily and also discolored.  Did not  effectively protect the phone.
I bought this case for my phone. I absolutely love it. I've had it about 6 myhs now and all the lil bling diamonds are all still in tact!!  💜
These wireless earphones gives a great quality sound. All the music sound and the voice during call can be heard smoothly. The earbuds are soft and comforting. I don't have to adjust it in the ears again and again. t was provided to me as a free sample to test and I recommend it to everyone.
I didnt expect much when i ordered the case due to the low cost after receiving it I am very happy with the purchase.
"This would have gotten five stars if I could have used all four connectors, someone with A Galaxy 5 or Note will be surely give it 5 stars.  This one  cable charges my iPod, iPad 2. iPad mini 3. Small speaker, Dreds Bluetooth headphones.  It will charge two things at once, say an iPad and a headphones.  Two iPads won't charge at once, probably they take too much power.  The cord is long enough to make it easy to use.  This is a no brainier  I bought two, one for daily use and one for travel.  I should have bought more it would be handy to have one in the car and I'm sure my son will appropriate one if he gets a chance."
Love this light.  It fits perfectly and works great.
good
So good I order four of it. A little disappointed I didn't order 5 so it would fit fine in the box at the same price of the total minimum shipping weight.
excellent
Recently got back from a domestic flight where we had the opportunity to use the headphones (in green) with our 6 year old. He loved them and even my 3.5 year old (which used his hand-me-down version of some other product) asked if she could use these! They liked how soft they were and I really liked the soft wire connection as well. Highly recommend. Easy to fold and carry in its own carrying bag which made it super easy for traveling. Kids were able to hear portable DVD player just fine over the plane engine (and we were toward the rear of the plane both times).
I like having the option of changing colors!
Ok
"Good quick charge, and also charges very much fast."
"Not a lot to say, except that this strikes me as a very well-made item. It's sturdy, and I feel it keeps my phone safe. I'm very pleased with it."
"After a couples of days a bubble appeared and it won't go away and it's annoying<br /><br />But other than that it's a good case but hard to take off, you have to use a card or something hard"
"I like this phone case. It looks similar to the color of my phone without the case.  It's not bulky and is easy to remove. I have dropped it a couple of times and haven't had any pieces chip off the corner. It is a thicker plastic, so I am happy with it"
i go to plug the charger in my phone and it doesn't work..
Too bulky and sticks out too far from the vent.  I like the cradle design.  I just don't like the bulkiness of it.
Looks great with the Space Gray iPhone 6. Love it!!!
Fast shipping and great price! Thanks.
Cannot wait to receive mine this would be helpful when I'm driving and use my phone for gps same time
"Works perfectly, battery life is long lasting. The control pane is a little heavy and can get annoying but easily bearable. I would definitely recommend this, worth the money :)"
"I received a product discount for a fair review.  Great product, protects phone well!"
Yes it fit my iPhone 5s perfectly.
Love the case. Very protective. Just a bit too thick. Makes phone more bulky then I'd prefer.
"Lost its &#34;color&#34; after one wear.. NOT GOOD, even for the price. Will not be buying anymore."
"I love it. San Antonio is a hands free city, now."
Low quality materials and unsecure for the cellphone.
Awesome case..
Fits my watch perfectly.
The outside border that holds the whole thing together broke down by the charging port after about 2 weeks.
This is a fun case.  It's like have a wallet with you.
"Ordered this sub enclosure as I really wanted some bass in my pick up.  It's a DVC SUB factory wired @ 2 Ohm's so I took the sub out and wired to 8 Ohm as my amp is not 2 ohm stable.  Really impressed with the sub, thought was a little flimsy sub in the enclosure. But the weight of the actual sub-woofer that contributes to 85% of the enclosure weight.  Have this little fella installed in my 1990 single cab Toyota Hilux (Pickup)  Hooked up to a old school Rockford Punch 60.2 bridged; @ 14.7 volts 280 Watts!  Perfect fit behind the seat...seat all the way back too! Give's a real nice bass too...not the awful boomy bass.  Good bass that's low!  Need now to upgrade my high end to perfect balance."
"Second Spigen cover I've used on my phones and I must say I'm impressed by how sleek and durable these cases can be! This cover in particular is even slimmer than the previous case I had on my Galaxy S5, but it feels just as sturdy. The included stand is a nice feature, looks a tiny bit flimsy so I don't think I'll be messing around with it much. Overall great product and excellent service from Spigen"
"I really like this charger set. It is so nice to be able to plug in my phone and have enough cable to allow the phone to be used in back seat. The charge seems to go quickly, it charges even with navigation on. I have not used it for data transfer but am impressed with all other aspects. I was offered a discount in exchange for my honest review."
We gave this to our granddaughter for her birthday.  She LOVES it!  She's 18 going on 35.  :)
Product slips out of car socket Replacement works very well/ changed rating to  4 stars
"Good sturdy case. Works great for me. The only issue is the thin rubber base at the.bottom of the phone, hence the four stars and not five"
Love it
It's really good gives a new nice look to my phone
I bought three of these and they blow out the fuses in all three cars I own.  Stay away from them!
please read & take warning its a fake. sucks & not worth the money returning asap!!
👌🏻👍🏻
Does the job well
Love this wallet case! It's not to heavy but it's definitely secure.  You can't put too much stuff in the card holders or it will not close correctly but that's okay cause it serves it purpose for me.  My license  2 cards and a few dollars in the money slot.
Good case but for phone calls people couldn't hear me through the case nor could I hear them.
"My cell phone is my only source of communication, it's great to know I have a back up.  I wasn't sure which size to get, glad I decided on the 20w"
fit perfectly..
"Works great so far, not good to charge while trying to sleep because of the blue light flashing."
Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
Thrilled with this!  No longer need a long cable to connect directly to modem!
I love these. They're great to ensure your Fitbit stays on and the colors compliment my bands with a splash of color.
perfect fit for the 94 accord 4cyl.
Good!
The instructions are impossible and of no value. I am a 20 year veteran of offshore travels and have never had the poor assistance. I would not buy a Garmi
"This case is impressive. I purchased this for my dad's new phone, and he asked me to put it together for him. I watched the installation video to be safe, because when I first tried to take it apart, it was so resistant, I thought surely I was going about it all wrong. The video reassured me that I had been trying to take the case apart correctly, but the rubber piece is so sturdy that my dad had to get one corner off before I could seperate the rest. It comes in two pieces, the thick, durable rubber piece, and a plastic piece which includes the screen cover. It fit his S5 like a glove. The side buttons are covered by the rubber, but they are still easy to press. This surprised me, as other heavy covers have made it nearly impossible to use the buttons. The screen cover seemed very durable, without impeding the touch screen functions. It seems just as durable and protective as otterboxes I have owned, at a fraction of the cost. I will be buying one of these cases for my LG in the future."
"Poor quality, would like a refund or a new one sent to me, till the nexus 5 2015 is available"
Great price easy to use.  Purchased for a tracking system.
Excellent
Great Job
Really Nice
Love this case.  Holds up good especially with my line of work
the only reason i didn't give this 5 stars was that it was super tough to get on and off the phone. other than that it's a solid case and it worked to expectation. i dropped my phone a few times while using this case and the case held up.<br /><br />i was given this case at a discounted rate in return for an unbiased opinion.
I usually don't rate products poorly but this is a complete waste of money. The charger does not seat properly so it rarely charges and will flip back and forth between charging and not charging every other second. This charger has a bad connection in either the micro USB port or the connection to the magnetic charge port on the phone. It is poorly designed. Buy something else. I'm looking at the OEM dock now.
"case did not work, I went snorkeling with it and leaked a lot and now my phone is water damaged. I had to purchase a new iPhone 6 unfortunately."
"I got this to back up power for the i-phone.I am normally around a power source, but if I decide to tear out on the bike,drop it in my pocket and go! I have only had to charge my phone three time/per one battery charge,but am sure I could go more. The led light is a bonus feature that helps also.Really bright.With charge level indicator, this is all you need for back up power for most devices."
I love this phone! i bought this a while back and I still have it. This phone case is very durable just like the headphones and the charger.
great!
"Easy to install on phone, nice bright color, quick delivery"
"Excellent case, excellent price."
Great and cheap replacement and it comes complete. Was surprised to find all you needed. Thanks
"These are just easy, cheap cables to charge my phone. Nothing fancy."
I really love my case.
I bought it and now returning it since Im not very happy with it. The USB 4-5 inches cable that came with it was found to be very loose and not working with the Samsung S6 edge I recently bought - while driving I tried to put my cell on but it kept on coming off. Now its a different story that you can buy a pack of 5 USB cables (of 4-5 inch each) on Amazon for just 3-4 bucks - so it may not be as serious issue may be. Secondly this charger didn't come with its own charging cable  You got to find one of your own. Everyone has one but that was kind of unexpected. Also while on my recent trip I put it on charging with my cell phone also hooked up. Next day morning I found it had only 2 blue lights on - not all the 4. So the continuous charging didnt really work for me. I am just sending it off.
"If you are going to buy this for your ttc amaze please don't buy it. But otherwise you can purchase it. I put this battery into my HTC amaze and then it just started giving problems. However, the seller is good, they communicated well with me and help me solve the issue. Thanks"
A good film for Moto X.
Really good
"Not what it was billed as, as only one port will charge at a time"
works perfect and holds my phone very snugly and no wiggling.
Worked great.  Looks like a new phone.
"Love simple sturdy, covers the  buttons but unlike other box it's thin enough that. I know I won't press extra hard"
"Not really what I expected but as long as you dont drop your phone (and if you constantly drop your phone, you should have a protective case anyway!!!!!) the case works fine. I also have another case that has the same exact shape and is made the exact same way (the only difference is the design on it) but after a while of taking the case on and off the color starts to wear off on the corners, and it starts cracking."
yes
Works perfectly. Fits perfectly
Inner lining of wallet ripped after one week of use. Ripped where plastic case is clued to the lining. Like the case besides this durability issue.
"All three worked well for the first week, but two stopped connecting."
"Like other reviewers have said, the protector does not fully stick to the phone and leaves a ring around the edges. It makes the phone look cheap. The top right of the protector has also been coming off since I put it on and leaves a large bubble."
Nice mount for my phone
"Great product, protective and useful."
thankyou
Great but you have to be careful sitting down or squeezing by someone
Great buy.
Excelent!!!!
"I purchased this for my mother in law. She loved it! It is so pretty. I find it unusual that the harder plastic cover comes apart from the teal, rubbery part, but it works great. It fit her phone perfectly."
Love it!
daughter loves it!
Very good! I had one for a year and I just bought 2 more.
"The plastic shell scratches very easily, but feels great in the hand, protects relatively well"
Great fit and looks elegant.
Easy to install & bubble free.
"Mounted with ease, used it today for a 5 mile bike ride and it worked great. It adjusts to fit any phone and holds it secure enough to ride on the road, up and down hills etc."
Never buy again . Only use one day and broken
I ordered these from BOOD. They came extremely fast and I received 6 instead of the 5 that was listed. They are quite a bit longer than the stock cord that the iPhone comes with (why doesn't Apple think to give longer cords?!) which helps with mobility while charging. I have only used one-- and I am hoping that it will work for a while. I will try to update this review once the first cord dies... Which hopefully won't be for a while!
love love love.
Came in on time and looks fantastic!
Worked exactly as advertised.
Best way to mount gps
It very useful
I love enjoying using solar power electronics. I never thing about to get portable charger.
"Amazing case - very clear, very slim, very protective. Excellent value, look and feel, quality."
2nd one great stuff
"This case goes above and beyond to protect my phone from the elements. I took it on a river tubing trip and tied the lanyard around the handle of my tube. At one point my phone was in the water bumping along the rocks beneath my tube for about an hour. No damage, lanyard held up great. (My note 4 also had a screen protector on it so the screen didn't get hurt).<br />Another occasion I took it to the beach and went swimming with it in the ocean. Took pictures and videos.<br />The only thing thats tricky is when the phone is submerged it doesn't really work well. The plastic clings to the screen and the phone thinks you're touching it all over the place. So it can be hard to zoom and take photos. Works better if you leave a little air in the bag when sealing it. The less the plastic clings to the screen the better."
Good convenient size for a briefcase. Wish the lighting end was a bit smaller so it wouldn't interfere with my case.
a very good case for the price range.
Great!!!
"Do not buy this head unit.  You will HATE it.<br /><br />Pros: Sound quality is great.  Connectivity is very good.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It has a HORRIBLE user interface.  No preset buttons, menus upon redundant menus. It's terrible when you're parked, so good luck trying to make it work how you want while driving.<br />2. It has abysmal build quality.  Like others have mentioned, it randomly decides to stay on every once in a while even when you remove the key to the vehicle, and you either have to disconnect the battery or the fuse to shut it down.  It freezes CONSTANTLY.  It reboots itself for no reason.  Oh, and my favorite: every single time you first touch the volume nob or buttons to change your station upon initially powering on the unit, it crashes the face display and has to restart itself.<br />3. No preset buttons.  Everything has to be done through a left/right button.  That design decision makes zero sense whatsoever.<br />4. Curved display reflects sunlight at any angle.<br />5. And while we're talking about the display, it is absolutely horrendous.  The worst--the ABSOLUTE WORST--display I have EVER had in a piece of car audio equipment.  Completely and utterly unreadable in sunlight.  So now, while driving, you have a unit with no dedicated preset buttons causing you to scroll through channels you can't see.  THANKS A LOT, KENWOOD.<br /><br />This head unit is terrible.  Do not buy it.  Does it sound great?  Sure.  But that is NOT worth it these days with so many other great options to purchase.  It crashes, it's frustrating to use, and even when it works flawlessly, the display is completely useless."
"This works very well, for only $13 it works great to play my music while driving through the city."
"Originally I believed this to be a good strong product.  It seemed durable and was easily attached to phone.  However, after only 1 month, the first crack in the protector appeared.  The edges started to crack as it does not  cover the whole screen of my Iphone 6 and I now have 2 other cracks.  I have ordered a replacement and will see how it does."
Always need a spare charger just in case and glad I got it from here :-)
LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. Best thing I've ordered off of amazon
Great product fast shipping
Works great
"After second use, it would not turn off. After letting the battery. drain, it would not turn on or light up when charging. I tried a new charger and nothing changed."
Works
"very nice unit ,much better than i thought it would be."
Didn't go damage free for 30 days. The case chipped the first time I dropped it and every time since
Excellent protection.
"This case isn't worth the aggravation. It doesn't fit properly and constantly (and when I say constantly, I mean CONSTANTLY) pops off, making it absolutely worthless. Whatever money you intend to spend on this case, just take it and use it as kindling to start a fire or simply throw it in the trash. You'll get more use out of your cash that way. This was purchased for a &#34;DROID TURBO 32GB in Metallic Black&#34; and not the ballistic version.<br /><br />We purchased Aero Armor for some other phones and were so satisfied that we thought these would be of the same quality... they aren't!"
Is very dificul for in and out  of it.
So far they have been really got
LOVED THEM AND THE PENS ACTUALLY WRITE!
works with plus and regular model
Short memory
Great fit and access to all ports.
Just for winding the angle
"I have to say, it's worth the price for what it does, anti-scratch class screen protector and it also prevents the screen from shattering."
"It was a gift for my niece, she likes it just not a big fan of the plastic feel."
Perfect product. Just what I needed
My daughter loved it and received many compliments. Product is made well for the price!
This armband has been very reliable and the price was very good.
The best universal car mount holder I've ever used. Stable and sturdy one
No problem--arrived when stated
Perfect
Not a good material I could made a better one but for the price I guess it's ok
Great color and protection
The Bluetooth did not work with my iphone6. But it a great product
Works great as intended.
"Excellent phone. I only to know, how i can move my app to SD?"
"This is my new favorite car charger. I love that it has a retractable cord. It also has a second usb slot so that you can charge a second item. I plugged my phone in to the retractable cable on my short trip home from work (about 15 minutes) and it charged my phone 5% in that short period of time. My previous charger would only maintain my phones charge on the same trip. The retractable cord is the perfect length for the card and it retracts smoothly, so it seems like it will last for a long time. This is a great charger for the price. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review."
great product!
Greater!
works just as advertised.
Great fit and not bulky. Great protection.
Well - this did not work well. It broke while attaching it to the bike - the locking handle just decomposed into pieces. That pretty much ended the ability to use the product. Do not recommend buying this item.
This case was bought as a gift for my brother. I already have the Otter Box.
This product is horrible. Reception is noisey
Love it! Works great for iphone once I downloaded the software.
Works well
It is what I was expecting plus It is a peace of mind the warranty that came with it.  Thanks!
It Was OK ...But Doesn't Cover THE WHole..Face Of Phone ...
"It's a Minion case, but offers very little protection for an iPhone.<br />I'd skip this unless you're very careful with your iPhone."
Works for me!
Product exactly as described at a reasonable price and prompt delivery. Couldn't as for more.
"So far, no problems with this item. Can switch to landscape in a pinch, which is a nice perk. Also seems to leave a decent amount of room for the air to flow out of the air vents. Decent price, as well, so yeah, no complaints."
"The case is not as solid as I thought it would be, but it fits perfectly and slim."
"Piece of junk! It actually sucks the life out of the remaining battery in my phone!!!! I thought maybe it was just my car but I tried it in my husband's as well and it does the same thing! Before I plug in my phone it says I have 17% remaining battery life, after I plug it in & check it in 10 minutes it says 12% remaining!!! I though hmmm.... maybe I just need to leave it on longer & wait.....NOPE!! In the next half hr it was completely DEAD!!!"
Same phone with same Color looks good together
Very good product supported by excellent service
Was definitely different to put on but works well and went on fairly easy... Was nervous to try it because it did not just stick on... But works better.
"Great product, fast charge, it works well for my life style."
"Practical, and nice design. Meets my needs."
Just got this for my new iPhone 5s. Came as advertised. I had been using the default screen protector for a week or so. I took it off and applied this as the instructions said and it worked perfectly. No air bubbles at all. Super beautiful and I feel really good about the safety of my screen.
Excellent customer service and product.
This cord is the worst I have ever gottenfrom Amazon it doesn't even work
"&#34;This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.&#34;  That being said, I believe the price of $8.95 would be a good deal as well. The case comes safely packaged in a molded plastic container that is actually easy to open. It contains a neck strap and a belt clip so that you can wear it on your person either way. I believe both are sturdy enough for moderate physical activity. The case itself is a squishy plastic pouch that closes at the top with two plastic locks. It seems to lock tight and keeps the water out; although I don't know that I would want to keep it submerged for long periods of time. It is designed to float and I think that would be safe unless it is damaged. I plan on using mine mostly to guard against rain when I am out in bad weather or in the shower if I am expecting an important call, etc. The case I ordered fits my HTC One perfectly and allows me to operate the phone while it is in the pouch. It has a clear back window as well in case I needed to take a picture. Operating the phone a lot in the pouch may result in the phone heating up, so use it wisely. It also came with a small micro fiber cloth to clean your phone. The only slightly negative point is that the case is not yellow; it is more of a very light green. That is no big del for me as I mainly wanted it to be brightly colored to locate it in the dark, etc."
Less than a week old and the charger unit is already broker. The plastic piece holding the charger pins broke loose.<br />Charger is basically a plastic P.O.S.<br /><br />Batteries worked OK for a couple of days. Now they cause my Note 2 to reboot. Back to my stock battery and phone is working fine.<br /><br />I can't return this P.O.S. fast enough!!!!
"Belkin makes great products - this charging cable is no exception: Durable, with a fast charge and easy to use. I really love the 90 degree angle on this cable = for me it keeps the cable away from my immediate worksite and allows me more freedom to move around."
"Love this case. It's thin, attractive, rugged... better than the first version I got from Spigen.<br />The S5 gets a bit warm from the CPU sometimes, but this case is easily removed if needed.<br />I run A LOT... this fits into the armband including the case!<br />There's a lip this protrudes ever so slightly around the glass to lift and protect it... the case is sharp and professional looking. The rubberized corner and end pieces don't mark up and don't impede the fiction of any charge or earphone jack... the camera and the finger heart beat sensor work perfectly... in fact, the finger heartbeat sensor are easier to align now!"
Samsung Galaxy S5 fits well!
Just perfect!
peeled off with in 1 week
"Very slim, chic, all encompassing, protective case. The layering within the case truly aids to it's low impact when dropped. And, I love how the case is designed to amplify sound through the iPhone's speaker -- very nice touch. I've owned the case for roughly 2 weeks now and I am very pleased. The case also allows for a nice hand grip with little to no slippage."
"I find this product awesome though I have some difficulty in activating the apps for the messages to work. But once I got the right apps everything went well and good. I even ordered 2 more for gifts. The voice command is great, the volume and the sound quality is perfect. Ever features is working good.  Its worth the money."
Great quality
"Wish it were more muted in color, but overall I like it."
was not white it came in Safire blue/bk it was a gift for someone but the person kept it unsatisfied  not good
Well made cable - works exactly like I want it to.
It's as expected.
Was a present for my fiancé. She is a ups driver and she won't take them off even after work so.... Yeah
I BOUGHT 3 charger one charger the input not working
"Sent me the wrong battery at first but were quick to rectify the problem and send me a new one, even though it was from China. New and proper battery is now functioning well in the iPhone 5."
"[[VIDEOID:f74ea91be658ade5bff7e1ac854a6877]] The Smarteck Qy8 Bluetooth 4.1 Headphone arrived within a couple days of being ordered via Prime. It was particularly well packaged with the outer device box containing two individual boxes.  The Bluetooth 4.1 specification was introduced in December 2013; the current specification, 4.2, was introduced in December 2014 and included some privacy enhancements. Bluetooth devices operate at approximately 2.4 GHz.  Most mobile devices are class 2 with a range of approximately 10 meters or 33 feet.<br /><br />OPERATION<br />I tested the headset with my mobile phone initially without charging. The received audio quality was acceptable, but that sent was not. Following several hours of charging using the included USB charging cable, I repeated the test using Skype's Echo Sound Test Service. This time, the audio sent and received was quite acceptable. Charging devices before use is generally recommended.<br /><br />The accompanying video demonstrates the use of the charging cable. A port for the mini USB connector is located on the side of one ear phone. A flap is readily pulled back using your finger nail. Once the standard USB end of the cable is plugged in, the QCY text on the other ear phone will display a red lighting. The red light will remain on until the cable is disconnected.<br /><br />Pairing with my Android cell phone and Microsoft Surface 2 Pro occurred without incident. Once paired, the headphone requires a few seconds to connect, assuming you have turned the headset on. To turn it on, press the button associated with the ear phone that has the volume control on the side; holding it down for 3-4 seconds is required. Turning the device on or off is associated with light and audible English speech indicators.<br /><br />OVERALL EVALUATION<br />As Bluetooth devices go, this one is probably as good as any, particularly in its price range. That being said, I've gotten much better audio quality results from a $30 USB wired headset than any Bluetooth device, including one for which I paid well in excess of $140.

Love the design of this case. The only issue I was concerned about was the tempered glass protector that I had put on my screen before the case. The case fit over with no problem and the screen is still very reactive to my touch
Very happy with how easy it was to install.  I had one spot thought it would stay after letting it sit for a couple days then it went away very happy with this purchase.
Works very well.
"The case is great, however, the shipping was way overpriced! I paid triple for shipping-more than the product itself...disappointing! Will not order again for the amount I ended up paying!"
"Very easy make your phone stand,good design! The sound quaility is also good!!"
great phone for such a low price.
Easy to put on and just what I was looking for.  Price very good in comparison to Apple product.
Great case!
Works.
As described. Very easy to apply. Fast shipping.
"Works great,  I like how it shuts off when your phone is full unlike other charges that make your phone beep over and over again telling you the battery is full and to disconnect the charger.  It also charges super fast on my Galaxy S6 Edge Plus"
I got this for my husband to use at work so he can always have his phone handy.  He loves that he can access his phone whenever he needs it and does not have to fumble with taking it out and putting it back anywhere.  It also makes it easier for him when listening to music to switch between songs and control the volume or whatever he may need.  It fit perfectly around his wrist and does not bother him at all nor does it get in the way while he is working.  It is made of a very nice soft material and has not caused any kind of irritation on the skin.  It is also something that can be used easily if you go to the gym or like going for walks and want to carry a key or something similar with you as it has a storage pocket for such items.  We purchased this item at a discount for our honest unbiased review.
"I bought this several months ago, still working great!!  I like the fact that both USB's are 2.1A."
It did not work properly.
Works well with 4th generation iPad!
Bought this case for my friend and she absolutely adores it. Great contrast to her black galaxy.
"Great phone. I've had this thing for about a week and so far so good. My previous phone was a Galaxy S3 but it was 3 years old and lagged a ton. I'm a casual user and mainly use my phone for social media, texting, and the occasional photo/video if I am out or on vacation.<br />The screen is bright but it's not as bright as a Samsung Galaxy. It's also huge and does hog the battery. I'm not a heavy media user so the battery life is fine with me but if you are constantly on your phone and watching youtube etc I'm sure this won't be the device for you. Under heavy use, you'll probably only get 10 hours on one charge if you're lucky. I get about 24 hours between standby and social media use. Some have commented that you can't see the screen in the sun but I see it just fine on the &#34;auto&#34; setting.<br /><br />The phone does get pretty hot if you're playing games or doing things that stress out the processor. GPS use will definitely heat up this phone and there is an overheating warning for if you up the brightness while the phone is hot. It hasn't just plain shut off on me so the heat isn't really a bother.<br /><br />Camera is nice. Works really well in well lit areas. In low light, it does drop in quality but not bad.<br /><br />Other than that. I'm enjoying this phone a lot. It doesn't lag or anything and is running just fine and a worthy upgrade. I can do everything I did on my S3 but without the lag. :) If you are a casual user and want an affordable phone that works well, this is a good option."
Love it
"POS that Amazon should be embarrassed to allow it to be listed for sale on their site.  Does not fit 04 Tacoma without cutting the dash due to the long depth in spite of being stated as &#34;fits your vehicle&#34; when make and model is entered in the pop up,  The calendar function day/date function is wrong which is amazing since that is the easiest module for a programmer to write, the clock refuses to maintain a time setting so the prominently displayed time is what ever it feels like displaying. The trim piece included wouldn't even fit the unit the injection molding was so bad.<br />Worst part is the seller Boss was totally unresponsive to submitted  questions regarding the programming flaws and then after four weeks had the gall to ask in a email how they were doing for customer service.<br /><br />The radio, backup camera input, and playing music files from the sd micro card did function.  If those are the only items you need and don't mind the wrong day-date and time being displayed you could take a chance on it how ever it may be doubtful you will get any  service if it blows out during the factory warranty period.  Take note some of the &#34;good&#34; reviews do not state they had installed it yet. Research it on the web at other locations before purchasing."
Great item....beautiful! Thank you!
"To be upfront about this, I did receive this case for free in order to write a review.  That does not change nor influence my opinion on this product.<br /><br />Really enjoying this new case. Prior to this, I had been using an OB case. While I love the protection that case offers, it tends to allow dust under the screen protector. I usually have the phone in my pocket, so dust can occur quite easily. So far I have not experienced dust under the screen protector.  The screen protector does not have the same 'trampoline' feel that the OB case has.<br /><br />Getting the hard shell off the softer part of the case was not the easiest thing to do, but it was not challenging. This is to ensure a good, solid fit, and it really helps ensure that this is a high-quality and secure case.<br /><br />I really like that there are included the three different colored back pieces.  I would, however, like to see the colors match the color of the iPhone itself.  I have the gold color and the colors are close, but do not match.  Since there's the hole in the back to display the Apple logo, you can see the color difference.  I cannot comment on the two other colors and how they compare.  I don't actually care about this, and it does not detract from the quality of the product at all.<br /><br />When changing the back piece, there may need to be a little extra 'attention' to getting all the edges flush, but with minor effort, it's no problem.  Again, the little extra bit of work pays off in that the edges are solid and tight and help ensure that there's less gap for debris to get in.<br /><br />The flaps that cover the slots are easy to open and close.  If I had to mention a detraction it would be that the cover for the headphone slot can occasionally be a little tricky to get re-seated, but it does go in.  Just might take a little attention and not something you can do mindlessly.<br /><br />I will be keeping my phone in this case.  It's great."
good
Always disconnected.
Color a little more on the blue side than expected. Otherwise made fairly well.
very pretty
Nice case. Everything ok
Perfect
I loved them. Once I got them set up so they would stay in my ears. Sound great. the batt. lasts through several workouts. I have not had them very long so I do not know how long they will last.
The sides to do close securely and pieces broke off after having it only 2 weeks.
Perfect!
"I'm really excited about this iphone 5s screen protector because it is the same kind that I bought at the phone store for over $25. In my opinion, these tempered glass screen protectors are far superior to the flimsy peel and stick ones that end up with bubbles underneath or peel off after a few months.  Touch screen works great through this screen protector. This is one solid piece that you lay down on your screen all at once. The kit comes with wipes, and easy instructions.  Works great with my iphone 5S. Very satisfied with this purchase."
Pretty disappointed in this item.....
No Problems
"LG Leon  Premium Phone Leather Pouch Carrying Case with Belt Clip holsters, I love it and will be ordering more"
Simple plug in
"Woow what a bad product! The word cheap describes this in every way.when i receive the headphones they had been broken off and were hanging by the wire. The bright side is that they work but not the best quality. Its mostly a rare case but how could i revecive my heaphone like they had being use for a couple months and then shipped off for some random person to used it next. I wasnt expecting alot, i mean they did cost less than 30 dollars but still not a this quality."
Quality looks good and prompt postage. You can't argue based on the good price.<br />Would be happy to recommend to others.
I ordered this product because I wanted the adhesive that is pictured with the replacement screen.  When I got the product there was no adhesive.  Very disappointed.
Good
I was surprised how well these earbuds sound clarity is good and so is the bass.
These only last a few months and then fray at the lightning connection end and stop working.   Seller offered to replace but never did.
everything good!
"Best thing I have ever bought on here.  Used hundreds of times.  Saves my life on road trips. Fits ipad perfectly, easy to adjust and mount.  Very easy to use.  Great value!"
It broke when I got it
"I love this holder! Secure and holds my phone very tight.  I have the Samsung Note 4 with the Otterbox case, so it's a large device - and this holds it perfectly."
This is a neat little device that holds your iPhone while you ride o you can use Gps or listen to music to pass the time. Holds your phone securely --just remember to take phone with you if you stop at the market!
Love how it fits the phone
I am still learning all the nuances of this watch but I really do like it.  I wanted an internet watch that looked like a watch but still connected me to my apps and this one is perfect and is priced reasonably.  I'm not a part of the iUniverse nor do I want to be so I was very pleased that I could get an Android watch that would meet my connectivity expectations.  I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone using the Android platform.
Every thing fits great.
Burnt out too fast
Perfect.  Just what I expected.
Great service and great product
Worked well
fits good.  makes the phone big and sticks to inside of pocket but it does protect the phone.
Works great and stores all the necessary items
"If i'd reviewed this within say a month of buying it, I would have had good things to say. It feels and looks nice and the little door to store cards works fairly well. But after three months, I just bought a different case and wouldn't recommend this one. First, it got very dirty looking quickly, and I couldn't get the marks off of it. Some kind of clear coating began to rub off the corners from being in my pocket, causing additional discoloration.<br /><br />The door/card storage honestly isn't great. I always had trouble prying out the card on the bottom (often to the point of having to remove the entire case). I wanted it to keep my metro card handy, which obviously means opening it two times a day minimum, plus whenever I used my credit card. Long story short, the door started to wear out after about six weeks and finally broke off completely after three months of normal use."
the metal clamps will scratch up your vents. I've used it for only a short period then stopped.
"Love it, does exactly what I need it to do and that is keep me hands free while enjoying my music in the gym! Lightweight, can barely tell I am even wearing it! Definitely recommend this product."
Case does everything as advertised. Just a little larger than I thought. A great way to protect my phone while on my boat.
"I've used a Samsung Galaxy S3 for two years.  Nightly charging to 100%, daily use.  Over time, the original battery slowly faded until the point that 9 hours of light use ran the battery from 100% down to 20%.  I bought & installed this new battery.  After charging it once, I thought it was just as bad (3 hours of heavy dropped from 100% to 50%).  After 2 more charges, the battery is much better (9 hours of light use from 100% to 62%).  I have much more freedom now, and am no longer so afraid to use my phone because of the battery.  Works well -- give the new battery a few days of charging before deciding if it's better or not.  Works great for me!"
"I bought the TomTom camera about a month ago, and am very impressed with it. I'm an experienced still photographer, but don't have much experience with video. I have done various time-lapse shots of storms, driving around, etc. and have gotten great results. I took it with me to Costa Rica a week ago, and being able to transfer files to my cell phone without use of a computer is a great feature while away from home.<br /><br />I *should* have bought the full package at first, but didn't realize that it didn't come with the underwater lens cover which is something I wanted. So, I ordered that separately from the UK and it was here when I returned from Costa Rica. I played with it in the pool once, and was very impressed with the clarity and lack of distortion. I look forward to doing some more underwater work with it."
Prefect size and great. Received on time
Nice case for a low price
Good quality
It was ok
Fast. Quality product.
good cell trac phone case thx deb
"I received the phone quickly. It was in passable shape but after one day the screen turned yellow. Upon further inspection, there is a small crack on the inside portion of the top right screen. We have tried to reboot the phone to no avail."
The colors are way different than view online. I didn't even know there's two colors on it. Wish it has free return.
Excellent product. The mesh baggie is a great addition.
I LOVE It Best Case for my LG G4  the Body Glove Black Slim & Flexible is non slip the grip is great and it Look's Good too I Love Body Glove Cases. Get one and you will Love it too.
Great kit! It has everything I needed and made my installation a breeze.  I will buy this kit again for future installations if it is still available.
I love this case! Extremely durable and holds a lot!<br />PLEASE MAKE IN MORE COLORS
My daughter loves it. Protects really good.
Excellent build quality. Nice thick cable. Should last a long time.  Honestly Skiva makes products with excellent quality and attention to detail. Everything from the packaging to the finish on the materials.  Never disappoints!
Very good. good seller.
"Just now coming apart a little here and there. I used it everyday, and the credit card slots are just now stretching out a tad. I would estimate I've had about a year! Very heavy use. I would recommend!!!!"
Plastic gets a little ruffled but still has great touch sensitivity!
Love this case! Looks good and does the job. Fits perfect and gives all around protection. I didn't think I would need/use the kickstand on the back but I end up using it all the time.
Nice
😀👍
Amazing band. Great band for the apple watch sports space grey. Fits perfectly and looks great. One minus point was that it was very hard to resize even with the tools it came with. Recommend this though as its fairly cheap!
"This product has only been used daily out only used in my house, not wrapped up or thrown in a bad or anything else. It stopped working properly today. I just bought it March 30, 2015. It has a one year warranty so I will be returning it. It's a hassle to return and I didn't expect to wear out so soon."
Awesome case
Great product.  Use these in purse and car.
This is so plastic that it don't even fit on my phone right
Very Durable!!!
Long cord is a plus
"Love it! I have all kinds of disc issues, slipped, herniated, degenerative, you name it. This is helping me improve my posture. I have it set to 10 seconds. I see my pain specialist today, so we'll see what he says."
The case is nice and all but it doesnt show the apple when on. And the screen protector was also bigger than my actual screen. Im keeping it for now but will most likely get another one soon
Item is just as described and for a fraction of the cost as cases sold at retailers
"This jammed in my car's radio as soon as I put it in - I can't comment on sound quality, as I've had no way to test it. Quite a disappointment, given the other positive reviews."
Good phone
"The battery came scratched and a little dented, so I didn't chance it being a defective battery. I sent it back. My battery doesn't have XXXXXXXX on it so I assumed this was not the exact same as my stock battery."
"Trust the reviews from the previous customers who have purchased this case and rated a low score: it doesn't fit the buttons on the phone. Both sides of the case seemed to be loose as oppose to a snug fit that we all should expect. In turns, the buttons are extremely hard to press because you sacrificed their tactility by putting on the case. However, as one of the only few companies who actually makes a case for the Galaxy S6 Active, you're very limited to the choices. Well, this phone is called &#34;Active&#34; for a reason so I'll just go without a case from now on.<br /><br />On the pictures, please examine the side edges carefully before you consider purchasing this case. As you can see on either side of the phone, the case is lifted."
"I think this mount is better than those that has a simple grip rather than a hook with spring. [[ASIN:B00VFEE86C Car Mount, AVANTEK Universal Cell Phone Air Vent Car Mount Holder Cradle for iPhone 6 / 6 Plus / 5S / 5C / 4S, Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge / S4 / S3 / Note 4, Google Nexus 5/4, LG G4, Nokia, Xperia, Moto, HTC and More]] --something like this, pay attention to the way it clips to the air vent. Talking about this mount, once you fit the hook into air vent it will never fall off. Also it has additional supporting stand so you can attach larger devices without worrying it would fail and break your air vent blind. The red rubber is efficient but I don't like the color; I would prefer a dark / black one since it draws less attention."
"The Tronfy functions exactly as it's supposed to. The music quality may<br />not be the best, but for the cost of the<br />device, it just can't be beat."
"Great product, did the job."
"With all the USB devices, this makes a great addition to my technology accessories.  I can take this anywhere and charge my phone and my tablet together."
It's a clip. That works.<br /><br />As long as you make sure it fits your model Escort of course....
Works great though there are times when the phone comes off the charger without a complete charge.
Fantastic for the price! I do like the quality. Thanks.
Just started using it but like that I can charge one battery while using the other
"This product saved an Amazon Kindle Fire HD when Amazon themselves would not support the device or offer a replacement after one of their updates left the device in an unbootable state.<br /><br />My daughter has a tendency to fill her kindle with videos and junk.  This causes a known issue where if the File System gets too full it can actually corrupt, crash, and become unbootable, especially if an update is pushed and not enough space for a proper install remains.<br /><br />Amazon has not fixed this issue (HTC used to have a simialr issue on one of their phones but they did fix it).<br />So the Kindle was stuck on the screen that says it failed to boot and gave the 2 options of try again or reset to factory defaults.  Neither worked.<br />Amazon, when called acknowledged the issue but said since the Kindle was out of warranty even though the issue was known there was nothing they could do beyond offer a lousy 10% off on a new Kindle device.<br /><br />Hop over to XDA, look up issue, find solution, requires cable, and download of a fresh ROM image.<br />Use fastboot cable to boot device, use Amazon's own stock image file to restore device.<br />Reboot device, fixed and just like new.<br />Sign into account, restore apps, done.<br /><br />Thanks for nothing Amazon.  At least users at XDA and this cable helped."
"Can't have too many charging cables these days.  My iPhone is my life.  I charge it at home, in the car, and at work.  It's also charged when we travel.<br /><br />Yes, I could take the same charging cable with me everywhere I go, but why?  At this price point it's work keeping one where you need it so it's always there.<br /><br />I've had no problems with these since purchasing them and am very happy with the quality."
made the installation so much easier by making the connections on the bench and then just plugging in in the dash.
Does not work at all. I got this one and a different one and both wet my things inside. Thank goodness my phone did not get damaged.
"I have tried many others... For myself, these CCM's are without a doubt the BEST yet.<br />The internal pen is a major plus!"
Excellent product
"Very happy, quality phone at cheap price"
Very good
"Hea, this item is great, durable, and fits perfect , Never expected this great of item at such a low price"
good quality and cute
Great when using my android as GPS in car.
"I really like all the features and hardware of this phone, battery life is good, camera is good (not the best but gets the job done) The only thing I don't like is the software, this phone is not very popular so phones like the M8 will have priority even though this phone is technically newer. I stayed at kit kat because of many users that complain about lollipop, Other than that, I really like this phone, I just wish it was a bit shorter and smaller for a 5.2 inch display phone"
"My son ordered this, and my husband and I were very skeptical since it is cardboard.  It was very easy to assemble, and works very well!  Very cool product!"
exactly as described. easy to push buttons if you are familiar with otterbox.
Such a pretty phone cover
About the nicest charging cable I have bought in my many years of android usage. Connectors feel solid and the cable is nice and flexible.
"Arrived when promised, delivered what we expected."
Made a great gift.
Love it perfect for Samsung Note 3
So happy with my case i so would buy from this seller again an the case came quicker then i thought i give this seller five stars an would recommend to my friends an family 😊
Thank you
The clap broke 😑
Can't hear on the left ear!
So pretty.  Just enough bling.  Fits great and so far no one is saying they can't hear me while we're talking.
"Wish I was able to use the volume and lock screen button. It def seems to be waterproof, but I'm not comfortable enough to submerge it in water."
Great product! Worked perfectly :)
"This is a great little charger to have around when you're not near an outlet or in your car, where most of us have portable chargers ready to go. The housing is solid- it doesn't feel flimsy at all and has a nice weight to it. It's fairly compact, just about 4-5 inches high and 2 across. I was able to fully charge my Samsung Galaxy 6 from 15% in about 2 hours, which is great. I found that I cannot use it to charge my iPad, but I can't imagine what emergency I'd have where I needed to do that, so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />I'm not sure yet how long the pack itself will stay charged- that is something I plan to keep an eye on, and will update my review if I feel it requires charging too frequently. The only small drawback I truly have with this charger is that the sticky square mount on the back, meant to hold the charger in it's packing, was difficult to remove. It had nothing to do with the functionality of the charger itself, but it was annoying to deal with. Other than that, so far I'm very pleased.<br /><br />I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Thank you
I brought this case for a co-worker she loves it!
Does the job.
Its an amazing screen protector Iv'e dropped mine about 20 times and ive had it on for a year. Definitely recommend it.
Love it! My favorite case
"Worked fine, but it needs a stronger strain relief.  The sheating on mine at the Lightning connector broke away from the connector leaving the wires exposed.  Soon after the wires frayed and I had to dispose of the cable.  Maybe this was a fluke, but for $15 I expected better."
"This battery is amazing!  Even on the very first charge, I got over 36 hours usage out of this thing.<br /><br />After my first full discharge and recharge, I got 65 hours usage out of it with my normal habits that involve regular amounts of youtube, texting and other programs.<br /><br />The included case is of relatively high quality as well, comparable to the Otterbox case I had on it with my stock battery.<br /><br />Instructions are clear and this thing will turn your phone into a thick heavy brick (approx. 1 inch thick) but the sheer amount of power you get out of this is well worth it."
They worked and they were a good price.
"It was okay, not the best quality but you get what you paid for."
"Broke within a couple weeks, was replaced, new one broke again within a couple weeks. Not worth the money"
Niceeee!
Its a good case. The rubber ends kinda bug when trying to speedily pocket the thing but all in all ok.
"Works well, replaced my previous device which was discount from AT&T and it lasted about 1.5 years.  When it indicates charged...take it off the charger because you may warp the battery and damage the charging circuit in the router."
Very nice case. I will order the black one also. And maybe the red one. Easy on and off.
can't believe the deal I got. I received a discount on my order for a fair review. this is great!
"For the money its as good as I could expect. When I first started playing music I was using the volume button on my phone, I was disappointed with the volume with my phone set on high. Then I held the + button on the remote and wow! it is more than the speakers can handle!! After raising the volume on the remote I leave my phone volume set to about 3/4 and that is a blast."
"This is good.  I thought it would charge my gadgets faster, but I haven't noticed any increase in speed over my old chargers."
"The case is beautiful and well-crafted. The only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating from me is because I wish it covered a little more of the phone. It only covers the back and sides, but does not curve to cover the face of the phone. I will likely have to get another case that offers more protection for anything beyond the normal day-to-day activities. Overall, I love the quality of the case and how great it looks."
Serves purpose :)
These did not work. No instructions and no power cord to charge it.
Works perfectly with my iPhone 6. It's great for my workouts and bike rides.
Real Happy with this purchase......have used it to charge up tablet then phone and had plenty to spare.......Very cool battery.
"This phone doesn't come with much in way of setting it up, and it is so old of a model and so basic that it took me a bit to get things done.  There is also a section on the website that answers  some common things such as speed dial, being able to disable the lock button on side of phone.  I have tested it and sound is good/clear.  At time of purchase, my father needed something as simple as this to, we hoped, communicate by phone now and then.  Within days of receiving it, unfortunately his cognitive ability slipped further and he is not able to use the product.  Of course this is of no fault of seller and I will donate it."
"Not wrth 1,star. Didn't fit phone. FALSE ADVERTISING"
Cute and powerful
"Big fan of this case - so much so that we've ordered 3; just because the plastic screen gets scratched from use. I've dropped my phone from my lifted jeep with this case and it was totally fine. I like it because it's very light weight and compact but protects as well, if not better, as an Otterbox case. We'll continue to order this case as long as it's available."
"Absolutely outstanding battery life and water resistant, for these two reasons I bought it to double as my bike computer.  Now onto the weaknesses, no flash for the camera and is pretty mediocre.  If you don't need the battery life I would go for the latest moto G instead for the better screen and camera."
"For the price (I paid $12 for a 4-pack), these cant be beat. They seem to be standard quality, not as heavy duty as the Amazon branded cables, but they're decent and do the job and at $3 apiece, I'm quite happy with them."
I'm so happy with this phone. I had asked tons of questions of other owners on Amazon and everyone was so helpful that I made the leap and bought the phone. I am so glad I did. This is  my first Android and it's the best for a first timer or an old pro. Thanks to everyone on Amazon I've now have this great cell phone!
This did not work at all. I purchased 2 and was completely disappointed. One could be a lemon but neither worked.
Beautiful Product. Thank you
There are great. Just what I wanted.
Got this a year ago and still works great! My mom uses it most of the time though haha.
Great product but mine got broke and I  need info to get it fixed ty
the battery lasts 4 hours
Love this phone
The case was delivered on time and the quality was as promised.
Great 'add on' find!  I bought it as a back-up in case my more expensive version of the same style broke and I've been using it trouble free for a while now so it's also a great value.
"Just what I was looking for.  For the price, it is excellent."
Excellent just what I ordered
Still work after accidentally being washed!
Perfect! Also very sturdy.
nice color and good product
"The plastic covering the camera slows down the camera's focus time, and the bit covering the heart rate monitor renders the monitor useless. You have to take the entire case off to use the heart rate monitor.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a fantastic case."
Worked well
"This is a neat little case for the Galaxy Note 4.<br /><br />The one I received is a matte black with a red kickstand component on the back.<br /><br />I am always excited about new tech products to try out, especially for my Note 4, so I couldn't wait to get my hands on this. When it arrived, I immediately put it onto my phone.<br /><br />It snaps right onto the back on the phone, and all buttons or entry points for headphones and charges are easily accessible through the cutouts.<br /><br />The kickstand on the back can be easily manipulated so as to be able to put it in the exact position that you want it, with 5 different position points. The first, obviously being all the way closed, then 3 additional points. The last peg (or 4th) requires that the tab be completely looped against the back of your phone. If this sounds confusing, there will be photos to demonstrate.<br /><br />It does hold my phone up pretty well when being compared to other kickstand cases on the market.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't particularly like or appreciate about this case is that it provides little to no protection for your phone at all. There is no support other than the thin plastic backing itself. Also, when the kickstand is in use, the back of the phone is exposed through the kickstand track.<br /><br />What I love about this case is being able to charge my device without a USB cable, and even being able to sync it. The kickstand component has the feature to do this by plugging the end right into any charging port or USB port and plug the micro charging end into your phone.<br /><br />That being said, if you are careful with your phone, I think this would be a great accessory for your Note 4, but if you drop it a lot, you may be needing a new one with this case.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review. This is my honest and personal experience with this case."
Worked perfectly!
Exactly what I ordered and expected. Thanks.
Useless piece of junk why does sound come out of the watch?
This worked for s couple of weeks then the clip that holds the case together broke.
Very good.
"Was a great deal for the money...till 3 teeth broke. Now won't poem or close.  You DO get what you pay for, sadly. Won't be ordering another since this one was only a few months old."
"Super cheap, replaced old one that lasted about three years.  Now using it as my off line music library.  Have a 32g card in it. :)  By the way, Galaxy S2 was still going strong.  Had to upgrade because Sprint said it would no longer support it."
This case does not fit an iPhone 5s like described!
"UPDATE September 6, 2015: Tab snapped off while inserting a new phone for use with this. It did not fall or get banged, It just snapped off with an iphone 5S. Also, it broke before we even had a chance to pair it with the phone. Therefore, lowering my rating to two stars. See picture.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: This monopod is almost identical to another I just reviewed but this one is about $5.00 cheaper and comes in this awesome hot pink color (my 12-year-old niece will go gaga over this) although the color is listed as red (it’s pink). The instructions are clearly printed on the back of the box and it’s a pretty straightforward set up. Assembly and pairing are simple and intuitive and you can setup and use this within five minutes of opening the box. The device has a charge already but comes with a USB charging cord and it’s probably a good idea to give it a full charge once it’s set up. That takes about an hour or so.<br /><br />The camera button is on the ribbed rubberized handle making it easy to hold and snap without much effort. On switch and mini USB charging port are o the base of the stick. The stick extends to about a yard in length. But the longer you extend the stick, the harder it is to maneuver, FYI.  This applies to all selfie sticks, not specifically this one.<br /><br />It would be nice to add the port for a tripod but otherwise very nice.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion."
Love it
"What more can you say? It does its job, and hasn't shown any signs of being defective."
"it does not work! I tried it in 3 different cars and cannot use on any small appliance (shaver, CD player, etc.)"
"Love it!  But over time, there will be dye transfer from your jeans if you are the type to put in your back pocket :)"
Good product!
Case held up great durring the time i had the phone!
Very happy with quality and performance.
"The title of the publication says 3350 mAh, but in the technical specifications set in the battery says 3200 mAh. Why the difference ?"
Very small phone mount not sticky at all and no 3m tape either had to file claim to get refund. just a bad seller and product
Looks like a great product. Very please
great deal.
I love the vivo 1v its a good  Phone
I tested this device out in the field and was pleasantly surprised! Off of one wall charge that took about 2 hours the device was fully charged. I was able to get two and a half charges on my Samsung Note 4. When the charger is in the sun and plugged in it will hold the charge on the phone but won't  charge it.  All in all I'd say it's a sturdy device. Works as advertised! Clip to gear and forget till needed.
"The materials are top-notch quality, the connectors are solid, and the cable is lightweight. Oh, and it looks really nice, too. In my experience, you cannot go wrong with Anker lightning cables. They're just terrific products."
Works. What else can you say?
Works as expected
great one i like it
very good product
"What a great little device. Puts out plenty of current and is stylish and easy to carry. I'm hoping the battery quality stays high for a very long time, which is why I chose this brand."
Is a excellent cover and super easy to install
I like them better then the beats I spent 179$ on.
Easier to use the phone. Charging time seems longer. Needed this cord.
Excellent buy for the price . it's a great product
Where are the pictures for this phone? All I see is a bedroom set.
I thought it was hard case. But it is cute for a cover. Delivery was great
Boyfriend loves it.
A great product. I've dropped my phone hundreds of times with this case and it's still pristine. Plus their warranty service is amazing.
Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
It does everything advertised.  Great product
"Brought this for my husband and he loves it. I held it a few times, and the case makes the phone feel nice in the hand."
"Great, like it"
"I have had ZERO problems, I have a Samsung Tab 10.1 s3, a Samsung s3 4GLTE handset, a Samsung flip phone CDMA style, a pebble wearable, and Bluetooth Bose speaker hooked up with all the correct Ufone cords.  must be the Apple... I really don't know and don't care for their style or equipment but getting Ufone intelligent cords sure does help."
Wrong item description...
"Item works good, have to remove phone cover to use."
"We charge 4 Nexus 7 tablets multiple times a day, and occasionally phones. This thing just sits there and does our bidding (as long as our bidding is charging devices). Anker is a great company, and they completely stand behind their products."
works as described. Good follow-up service
Ordered two and I got them way before my expected delivery date! They are stylish and fit perfectly I love them! The band that they come with is useless to me.
Fell once out of my pocket and completely broke.
another chinese junk.. does not hold charges.. i can not even charge my phone full  for 1 single time... drain out too quick.
I got this product in the exchange of a review.<br /><br />It is pretty good and fitted well. I would recommend this for screen protector.
Fdo
Very good!
Works great
"The device is not able to read fuel consumption of a BWM 120D which make the device useless at trip analysis. Also it reports a cryptic error code from the powertrain without any explanation what it is. In short - this device is quite useless for me.  I just realized that all other 5-star reviews were written on July 26, 2015 which makes them feel like poor fake reviews!"
Works GREAT with my Asus Nexus tablet.  I plug it in and I'm watching videos or whatever I want.
Great value for the price and qty.
Great case does as it should!
Excellent...
These are so chic and love the gold accents in all the right places. They are sleek and James Bondish. I would have given 5 stars but I'm unable to use in my car to hook up with USB plug in and won't work with Bose speaker UNLESS you take off case... Total bummer but I still love the case. But all they need to do is make the hole bigger and voila !! It's perfection!!
I bought this case for my co-worker who needed a different kind of clip for his LG Cosmose 2. I have purchased one like this before and it has served me well over the years. In fact I'm still using it. I highly recommend this case.
I got these cases in every color & the came before the expected delivery date😄😄😄😄
"I bought this when my last bluetooth gave up the ghost. The sound quality is great, it holds a charge longer than my last bluetooth, and it's very comfortable in my ear. I like it so much, I went to buy a 2nd one as backup... unfortunately, the price had almost DOUBLED. If the price goes back down, I'll buy another one. Otherwise, I'll just be happy using this."
good
Perfect
good phone<br />really good looking<br />...sometimes it gets really hot
nice and good price
Don't waste time & money ..this Tracker working  for  two weeks first time ..  I ask for replace item .. the new one work two week ...  just waste my time... hard for SYNC  and use the app ... now i try get my money back...  conclusion is really bad..  again I waste time & Money front MAY 03 to Now only work 4 weeks..  Really!!!<br />Malo Malo no pierdan tiempo y Dinero... solo funciono 4 semanas entre Mayo y agosto .. lo cambie una vez y lo remplazaron el segundo lo mismo!!
pretty
I received a bad part after putting on it starting separating from the base and had to pay to get a brand new screen after already buying this one
Great case great price
excellent
"Easy to apply, goes on flawlessly! Very happy with purchase."
"As past reviewers had indicated, it is a bit bulky and the connections are not tight, but it works."
"This is the best cell phone case I have ever bought, I have dropped my phone 100's of times and it's perfectly safe."
just as explained
It works great. I needed one for downstairs or for the car.  No more dragging the original cord around.
"Absolutely amazing sounds. Very loud, very portable, very easy to setup and use. I have limited space in my apartment, so I bought this in order to use with my Audiotechnics record player connected to the analog connection and a Raspberry Pi Philco Radio Jukebox conversion that connects via optical cable. If I get really lazy, I just connect via bluetooth on my phone."
not good at all and i don't recommended to buy it
Just as described.  Very protected.  It does add some weight.
Good Item fits well and is a solid piece
Great price and fast shipping!!
"I purchased this to replace a one year old S4 case.  I figure a year is pretty good based on my phone usage.  I received this case and attempted to carefully install it.  After several attempts to fit the rigid outer shell over the flexible inner liner, it broke unexpectedly at the volume control / edge of screen location.  The flexible inner liner is slightly too small to fit well and the outer liner is brittle compared to the Spigen case I was replacing."
Works as expected.
To big want stay in ear.
DOES NOT WORK
"nice quality, holes deep enough for the USB cord to fit in.  Very pleased.  I would definitely order this<br />product again."
Great!
Great replacement!
This case is awesome. Has extra pocket for key so you don't have to worry about it getting lost.
"Almost made it the 2yrs life of the phone's contract, but definitely not intended for someone who occasionally drops their phone. 2 times and my phone's screen is done. Very convenient keeping the basic cards & I'D attached with your phone. Next upgrade, though, I'm sticking with Otterbox & a separate wallet."
Too lose does not provide any protection
"Best Case ever. All buttons and accessories (Headphones, Chargers) fit and work perfectly with the case on.  Slim design but not cheap. Has a nice smooth texture. Extremely light. Hand Strap fits well (does not include a hand strap but most any strap will fit on it. Extremely satisfied. Totally worth the deal. I would pay 25$ for it (base price). :):):) shrek approves too."
"Case is cool, but not great durablity. I haven't used it much, but it is nice for someone who would rarely use their phone and wanted a slim protective barrier."
Love it!! Use it all the time!
Excellent .
Nice case
worth it
"Very cheap quality, carriage didn't align properly with the apple on my phone. I threw it out right after trying it on my phone"
Firm and colorful. Great buy.
Work great.  Stay on well.
"These are great!  I accidentally dropped wire cutters on my phone.  They gashed/cut the screen protector, but my phone screen was unharmed."
Many uses! Like it a lot.
Better than expected!
This product was ok at the beginning but I love changing cases but out of no where the back screen protector started cracking easily so I don't recommend it for ppl who drop there phones constantly because this product will NOT protect it it is cheese and doesn't last long
Just got it. Love it
"Yeah, I really love this phone. Works flawlessly (so far). Not missing anything important when compared to the S6"
I was very satisfied with this product and I was more than satisfied with its delivery because it came earlier than I expected it to.
Disclaimer: I received a discount for writing a review of this product. Arrived promptly and was easy to use. I've only been using it a short time but it has protected my screen as advertised.
I have gotten more inquires and complements on this case than on all iyherd👍😬
Bought 2 and they both failed after 4 months.
I have used this same product previously on other devices and I love it. I have had to replace once already on my s6 but that was because of a set of keys that scratched the protector and it was laying on them all day and I didn't realize it.<br />Application is
I'm in love with this case
"This was a good fit I like that the key board is very secure and won't fall out. The color is darker than I expected, but is still OK."
"Purshased one today, looking for a cheap but good looking phone just to see how those unlocked ones work. Pros: Price,  Big Screen, Kit Kat, Works on Tmobile H+ Nice, download speed of 6.4 mb average on the area purchased ,Puerto Rico,  it uploaded the Tmo network and Apn automaticly,  unboxing, it brings 3 screen protector (one already.placed), charger, earphones and a really cool fitted clear rubber case, everything nicely packed. For the price, 150$ total, it is a nice deal. CONS low ram, low memory 4gigs You can.use the external upgradable to 32 The phone says 8mb camera but it  sucks, pictures look so so, I checked the resolution and.it was at 8mp.maybe I'm just used to my Samsung camera. Still.haven't used the selfie one, so it must be awful too. It dont have an factory android.launcher like  touchwiz home instead brings an next launcher as default app, it look nice, but the icons are crappy, I downloaded the go.launcher and.resolved.it.until.I.can.get the original.kitkat launcher For the price, you just have to drop in an 32 g microsd and.you're.done!"
When I got the case I was happy. But after a couple days I noticed  the exterior layer was peeling off. Would not buy from them !
The cover around the band comes of after a few days of use and heavy sweating. I received a replacement and it did the same thing 4 days later.Only part that stayed as it is described was the screen protector. Very upset I wasted money on this and still got charged for a faulty product.
Love this mount. If there is any con at all it would be a pain to remove but 99% of people would manage just fine.
Awesome
"Works great, would definitely recommend."
Great band for the apple watch sports space grey. Fits perfectly and looks great. One minus point was that it was very hard to resize even qith rhe tools it came with.
I bought the wrong item product as offered
Worked great!
I have been using these on my Vivofit 2 for months now. I basically never take my vivofit off and have put it through some pretty tough situations--the display still looks brand new. This is cheap insurance and if you have a vivofit you NEED these.
I love it  bought a second one. May buy a third. Heavy duty.
Great. Love it. Thank you.
"great cable, worked as described"
I actually enjoyed these and the quality of sound is very good
works great
"I love this elegant, no-fuss, portable sound amplifier for my iPhone! It's easy and durable. When I don't need it to amplify, I prop my phone horizontally across the top of the sound pod to use it as a phone stand."
meets my needs
"I'm trying hard to improve my fitness levels and this is really helping! It's a great prompt during the day to encourage me to be more active. The motivational messages such as 'you will have walked 72 miles in your first month' start to put your effort into real context and spur you on!<br />For me though the most life changing feature has to be the sleep alarm. I am most definitely not a morning person. I struggle to wake at a regular time and I am avoided by people in our house as my sunny nature does not surface until around 9am! I started using the band after a holiday to the U.S. and jet lag is always a HUGE issue for me. However, I set the band to wake me during the light sleep phase 10 mins before my usual alarm. It has made the most amazing difference - I've conquered jet lag without any problems, I'm waking at a consistent time each day and I'm actually able to get up and function like a pleasant human being! I feel almost evangelical about the difference it has made to my sleeping habits.<br />I highly recommend the UP24! P"
So handy to have a back up battery especially with grandkids using my phone... True to advertisement and quick shipment
This is really a great quality product. I definitely  recommend it.
"I have not used this product yet, but my daughter had one exactly like it when we went to Italy.  It works great for curling irons, camera batteries and cell phones.  It was always charging something!"
Very good.
"Works great, nice not having a bunch of stuff plugged in."
"I was sent a review copy of this product free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I have thoroughly tested the product to the best of my ability before posting this review.<br /><br />The I6 Cable(TM) lightning cable is a very good alternative to the genuine Apple lightning cable, and it's value for money makes it far superior than most alternatives on Amazon.<br /><br />From Apple, the lightning cable costs $19 and will probably last you around six months before the plastic wrap begins to peel. A very common issue amongst Apple users - just check any social network!<br /><br />The extra length means you can actually use the phone while it is charging.<br /><br />This lightning cable is wrapped in a slightly thicker and more durable plastic which will hopefully last longer and prevent it from tearing and ripping around the lightning connector area.<br /><br />you won't get an error message saying 'This accessory is not compatible with iPhone' when you plug it in. This is usually the case for a lot of cheaper.<br /><br />I can also confirm this works flawlessly with my iPad Air, iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. It's also good to see that I6 Cable(TM) have confidence that their product will last longer than the Apple equivalent, which is why it comes with an 12-month warranty! I'll surely be updating this review in 12 months time.<br /><br />An improvement that could be made to the I6 Cable(TM) lightning cable is that it could be wrapped in Nylon rather than plastic. There are other products out there that use a Nylon cable over a plastic one simply because it is so much more durable and can withstand a lot of abuse. I currently use a Nylon-wrapped lightning cable and it has lasted me over 8 months already without a single sign of wear. It will be interesting to see how this one holds out comparatively."
"It took one week before it started to short out at the phone end. You could send us another cord and i'll see of that was a fluke, otherwise, I will look into sending it back."
great product
Doesn't fit on watch face. Threw them all away.
Works great. We now have a single charging station for all our devices. Speedy charging of iPhones.
"lightweight to use for my phone, great price"
"Looks fine and works well. Pretty sturdy, hope it hold up to work though"
"Very easy to put on because it's a glass plate and not a plastic film.<br />But it cracks easily. I don't drop my phone that much and when I do it's a small drop with no damage, but the few times I've dropped my phone this screen protector cracks. I'm glad my actual phone screen didn't, but I don't think it would've anyways. I've bought 2 of these now and they have only lasted a couple weeks before cracking from a small drop.<br />Other than cracking easily this is a good screen protector."
Not happy at all the sliding pin in the back of the click holder keeps coming off
It's more beautiful than I expected! !!!! Made the right choice
"Color was nearly same as on my computer screen, but I am okay with it. And it's already saved my phone twice. May just need to get another one in a different color."
Haven't had many problems so far. Connecting everything was very simple. One problem I have found is that the music distorts when something is being charged with the sub and the volume notch isn't the most responsive.
useful accessroy in my car
the power wire is ok for running some weak subs  RCA cables are cool  but the speaker wire is s*** and is a pain in the but to work with  so this kit gets 2 stars
Holds my LG G4 just fine and i love the dual charging capacity.
"Terrible quality pieces of garbage is what these are. Stay away from this screen. Ordered one, did install, screen faintly lights up black, no color, no picture, no usability. Tested the flex cables coming from the screen, they connect fine, and appear to be in overall good shape, more than likely the pins on the lcd cable do not line up properly with the pins on the actual phone...per usual hong kong handmade style. At this time though, unknown cause of  the issue. Took off and ordered a replacement from the seller. Second one arrives after several days of waiting. It should have been sent with the original two day shipping, but instead they sent it at their own pace. Did the install, and voila! Same exact issue. not a difference at all. Clearly these screens are pure garbage, they are not tested, and they do not work. The price of this product might make people think it is of quality, but it is truly a rip off......Buyer beware...."
Great cable i use one for my desk setup and it bends and holds it shape well have had it for a long time and it hasn't broken at all and i am really happy with the build quality of this product i would never buy a cheap cable again these cables are the best.
Great unit so far. Use weather and traffic apps linked to cellphone.
perfecto
"Good earbuds are hard to find at a great price and I was looking forward to trying these with my MP3 player and iPhone6.  It comes with 3 sizes of silicone flex sleeve so you can choose which is best fit.  I also like the MFB, one button controlling,  to use as answer/end/reject for all IOS and Android system cell phones and the play/pause/playback/previous music on all IOS and some Android phones.  The microphone works grat on my iPhone6 for others to hear what I am saying while talking and doing stuff.  It is amazing how comfortable these earbuds are even using them for a long time as I workout for 2 hours.  My ears did not feel irritated, bothered or achy after using these for my workouts.  They sound great to me with my MP3 player with a good, strong bass and blocks out sounds in background so that I only heard the earbud music and nothing else, which is great at the gym with the loud overhead music I don't want to hear.  Great product at a great price for oneself or to give as a gift.<br /><br />I received my product in return for my unbiased and honest review."
Bought it. Seems like it would protect the phone. I ended up returning it though since I liked a different cover better.
Great product...
Great case but a little awkward to handle when making or receiving calls.
Great little amp
Great phone! Replaced my 4.0
I have several of these and I love how strong they are.
I purchased this as a gift for my Husband. He loves how easy it is to use with his S5.
Works well and charges quickly!
Seems as though there are a lot of bogus reviews of this product. Every other person received this product free to review.........Beware!!!!!!
Excellent
"No problem at all with this charger.  I needed something easily packable and light and powerful, and this fit the bill for a recent trip."
BEST CHARGER
Easy connection but can't use it with the cassette for better quality sound as hoped as it squelches really badly no matter the volume.  When using the low FM receiver function on it we find that the lower station frequencies are now so crowded with religious channels that it is impossible in some areas to listen to your music as the stations bleed through.
very good
Great alternative to the very pricey Apple version. I have had it for a few weeks now and I love it. Easy to adjust to fit and works great when at the gym.
Have not used all of the cables yet. First one did not work  (to charge from a computer) until paired with a wall charger unit.
If you are looking for a better quality screen that the cheap ones then buy this. The tools are also much higher quality but you really only need one set.
"This power bank is lightweight and easy to carry around as a backup, and is great insurance if your phone runs low on battery throughout the day. Of course, you do need to remember to take your phone's charging cord as well.<br /><br />I like the size, just a bit shorter and a bit wider than my iPhone 5, and about the same thickness. Another nice thing is that it comes with a velvet drawstring pouch to store and carry it in.<br /><br />I wish the battery life were a bit longer. It seems to be good for one or two full phone charges, then it needs to be recharged itself (by plugging into your computer). But that's a minor quibble."
Just what I was looking for ... thin & durable.
Excellent case up until it came apart at the seem between the clear back and the black perimeter.I put the case on m phone never took it off and noticed today that it was coming apart.
"Excellent product. Initial purchase had one problem in that USB end broke inexplicably. However, once I contacted support team at Native Union, they were swift in apologising and sending me a new cable in the post ( which is working fine ). Product is really useful in that 3 metre solid fibre cable allows so much more flexibility for usage while using far away plug points. The moveable weight ball is also a simple yet genius idea as it enables the stability of knowing that IPhone won't slide off and fall/smash on the floor. Combined with the excellent customer service at Native Union I would strongly recommend this product. This a company that really values its customers, well done NU!"
"I could not get it to work, Returned for full credit and purchased another pproduct."
Excellent! Worked great.
Love it. Charges my phone quickly.
Works great!
This is a fantastic external charger it charges my Samsung Galaxy S4 very fast. I highly recommend it.
Good
I bought two of these and they work very well. It makes charging so easy. I highly recommend!
"So far so good, it fit perfectly & it is an original otterbox."
"Good case, but when I use the flash on the camera, the pictures come out pink because of the rubber part of the case. I have purchased this same case in other colors and never had this problem."
Love them. Such a convenient devise for iPhone and iPad when making notes elsewhere!!
"The clip fell apart the first time I tried to use it. Even though it fell apart the seller stood behind it, Very happy with the seller."
I love this device!!!
Two chargers for one and they both work really good!
My previous glass screen protector (from another company) was put on my phone at the ATT store.  I was afraid that I would mess up if I attempted to change the screen protector myself.  The one I bought at the store would've cost over $30 if it had not been for my credit.  I was weary about purchasing a cheap glass screen protector. This screen protector has exceeded my expectations.  The Maxboost website has a great video for how to install and the product included everything needed.  Hopefully it last a while.
bought these chargers and within a month 2 out of 3 of them were broken!
"It is exactly what I was looking for, paid for and received."
"Great price, fast shipping, very happy with purchase."
Worked great for iPhone 6 plus. Just not convenient losing the power port when not near a wireless charger.
Nice if you would say that the socket us sold separately up front now I have to order one and wait two more weeks! Riduculous!
Very cheap. Not what I was expecting at all.
Awesome I got 2x solar panels. It comes 2x sockets to charge your tech. I notice it charge my stuff at light (inside lights) weird but awesome.
Ad advertised
Said it for iPhone 5s.  Bulls***. Was for iPhone 4. Too expensive to return
Excellent product  :)
As advertised.
"Worked perfectly, when I used the charging cord that came with it. That cord is quite short, so I tried using another mini USB, but it did not charge correctly.<br />However, during long days, this adds the charge I need and does it well."
"I used to have an Otterbox for my phone, but the problem was it was a black case and was CONSTANTLY losing my phone. This case it 100% comparable to the Otterbox I had and for less than half the price when I purchased it. Also, I don't lose my phone anymore because it's neon green!"
"So far so good.. They were a bit tricky to get on correctly at first, but they really help with the iPhone earpods falling out. Could see myself having to replace them eventually because of the cheap, rubbery material it's made out of... But they're awesome right now!"
love!!!!
this fits really well and is a great product. I liked it so much that I also bought one for an S3 we have. Very good price and service too
Good Product
"The protection is great. Dropped my phone face down on concrete. The protective film cracked, but not my phone. Now my issue is the &#34;life time warranty&#34;, I've called and sent an email, no returned call, as the message says, and the email address is no good. So now what??perhaps this is the only way to get their attention. If there is a guarantee for replacement. I would like a replacement please."
"I bought this phone for my 11 year old daughter. It was an add on to my other qualifying purchases so it only cost $5. It's her first cell phone so I thought it would be a good learning experience for her to handle and maintain the cost of her minutes.<br /> She was really excited to receive it. It holds a charge all day and she plugs it in at night. It does the three most important things to her: Text, play music, and make calls. The camera isn't the best quality. After about 2 weeks of use she did say she had difficulty receiving texts from her friends-almost as if they are dropped but the sender (her) was not notified. She doesn't receive some pictures her friends send her but that is to be expected with 3G rather than 4G. After a few drops we've discovered it's pretty sturdy. We've since gotten a case for it.<br />  It's been a great learning tool for her. She monitors her minutes and uses some of her allowance to purchase minutes. For now, it's a great little phone for her and she's pretty happy to have it. I'll upgrade her when she's 13. :)"
I have really enjoyed this case. Fix perfect on my phone. Great for the price.
"I am super delighted with this case/cover for my IPhone 6 plus.  Slim, well made and protects nicely.  Granddaughter has already dropped it and kept it safe. I'm not crazy about those heavy otter box types (bulky).  This one is light weight and colors are perfectly matched (I've got gold). Plus I can change the back cover if I'm in the mood for black or silver.  Great product. Thanks."
Love it! Fit perfect.
nice phone
Supercute.  Love it.  No jewels have fallen off and I have had this for months.
"Love this case for my phone.  My otter box was so bulky I didn't like it.  The service  was superb and fast, and the cost was terrific!!!"
"My daughter recommended this case, and it is as tough as she advised."
"After I received this watch on time, I configured it with my Sony xperia z2. Everything went on smoothly.<br />Since April this year to date, I don't have any complaints. Again, I recommend it to everyone."
"It was exactly what I needed it to do! Be mobile and charge my phone at the same time! For me, it was the perfect length!"
"Excellent phone case! Love that it has multiple card slots and the magnetic clasp keeps the cover closed. Holds 6 cards and some cash and the magnetic clasp keeps the cover closed! Excellent product, and very durable."
If the price had of been any lower the seller would have paid me to take it. Great purchase
"If you can spare the vent, this is likely the most easy and effective car mount mount you can get for the price."
Damaged when arrived
"They are perfect, and price was great!"
Makes my phone (GSIII) run like it did when it was new. Pleasantly surprised.
It works as expected. Very happy with my purchase
This is an all around win win situation! My order arrived on time as promised. Extremely easy to apply. No glare or distortions. So relieved that my phones screen is now protected. I have recommended the Pleson tempered glass screen proctor to my friends.
Cheaply made and a poor fit.
Great quality at a very good price.  Arrived quickly.
"I've had this charger for about 8 months now, and I am here to tell you, it is fantastic! It works well on my Nexus 6 with a dual layer case. Just set it down, and click, it's charging away!<br /><br />The only thing that been slightly odd over these months, is that sometimes when I take the phone off of the charger, the blue light will stay lit. I have mine connected to a power strip that has a switch, so I just do a quick off & back on with it, and the blue charging light stays off."
Great headphones to workout in.
Flawless! I ran into some trouble with my original port that just didn't have a good connection. Ordered this back and a charging pad.  I admit I was nervous after reading some of these reviews. Charged it today right after it came in the mail. Flawless! What a relief! Worth the wait of shipping it from China so don't expect it until about 10 days. But so sweet!
Clip is not very strong.  Otherwise the case is well made.
EXCELENTE
"Junk, Beltronics Pro 500 falls offs constantly. Save your $$$$  Going for a mirror mount next."
Fdo
The screen started breaking on the third day by the home button. I checked to make sure the screen was placed properly and it's not sticking out. Some days later it started crumbling off around the corners... It looks nice but the durability is very low.
Fit well. Dont plan on taking it off though
Now all I need is an Iphone cover with purses!!!
"I bought this for kayaking thinking it would be great seeing as how it would never go directly in the water.  The first case I ordered immediately got my phone wet.  I was able to save the phone but requested a replacement case.  I received the second case and it worked for about 3 weeks.  After some splashes water made it's way into my phone and now I have a fried iPhone 6,  DO NOT RISK YOUR PHONE!!!!"
"Good case for phone , got it quickly."
"I live in Venezuela, the phone works well with movistar and movillnet. I am very pleased with my purchase, easy to use and supports all applications I have installed. Really great and the best value."
Perfect. Everything you need all in one.
Great product this is the second one ive ordered. They work great. I will be getting another
"Like the way it applied, wish it would reach the corners completely though"
"There is a ridge on the bottom that partly blocks the rear charger port on my Garmin GPS.  However, I just managed to shove the Garmin into position with the cord attached.  The holder grips it firmly and doesn't slide around on the dashboard.  The last universal holder I bought had little plastic gripper fingers that broke.  So far, this holder seems to be a more reliable performer."
Awesome
"I bought this desktop charger for a cruise that our family took. The cruise line did not allow power strips, so this desktop charger worked perfectly and replaced the multitude of chargers in our home after the cruise. We use the charger for all our devices; iPhone 6, iPhone 4, Kindle Fire and Nook."
Great
The case was really classy with the finish and quality. Would have been great given the top of the phone is covered with the white frame too..It just looks like a bald head. But irrespective of that I loved the case very much. Would definitely suggest to a friend
"Case fits well. Does not add too much in the way of size but still provides adequate protection. Case easy to handle, no slip."
Great price! Works exactly it said.
I love this case! It fits my phone perfectly. I was worried that i wouldnt be able to get my stylus pen out but have no problem. And the lightning bolt is just like the picture.
"Easy to set up. Even though my GPS screen size was 5&#34;, (large and heavy) I put it up on the dash and whipped around a corner and everything stood fast.  In other words it works great!  And continues to do so after several weeks.  Oh, yes, it is very easy to take down so that thieves aren't tempted to break in and steal. I just pull the mount and screen off the dash, and lay it on the seat. I also find it easy to pull down, change the settings at the wheel and put back."
Nice
Doesn't charge fast at all
"Arrived on time, small area already peeled off. We'll see what happens in a few months."
Exactly what I was hoping to get! Tough but with a feminine touch. Thx!
Works good and sound quality very good.
"This is my second version of this case. (First phone died, 100% unrelated to the cases' stability). Been the best, sleekest, slimmest, most attractive and &#34;natural&#34; case I've ever seen. (I buy an i-phone to have an i-phone, not a 10 lb utility box). The first one started to pull apart after a couple years, (probably because I am unnaturally hard on phones) and the company replaced it promptly, no questions asked. For a cheap case that lasted that long, I would've been happy to throw it away and buy another one, honestly.You CANNOT go wrong with this phone case. Period. The end. My phone had endured harrowing encounters on the weekly, and when I pull it out of the case (which is SO easy to do when needed for inserting in an armband, etc.) the phone is still immaculate. Stop wasting your life reading endless reviews and buy this case. You won't regret it."
"I have had fm transmitters before, and I was aware going into this purchase that reception can be sketchy, and you usually have to have the thing sitting just right.  When I got this unit I was very pleased with it's ease of use, variety of features, and for being an fm transmitter the reception I was getting from it wasn't too bad. It was definitely tolerable. This was my cheap solution for modernizing my truck without tearing into the dash to install a custom unit. Can't beat it for the price.  Oh, but fyi... It's pretty bad when being used for speakerphone. I tried it once, and the other person couldn't even hear me. I use a different unit for phone calls. This unit works well doing just about everything else it advertised."
Love this phone.  I have owned 3 and will probably buy again.
so far so good. packaging was ok
"Works great, and my God, the awesome lights on it are so cool to see in the dark.! I mainly use it when I leave the house and know I'm not gonna be back home to charge my phone (for example, long out of state trips or a weekend out camping). I can certify and say that this thing can fully charge an iPhone (I have a 5S) 5 times and possibly even 6 times (I haven't tried). I recommend it.! It's very useful.!"
Love this watch!!  I'm not a serious athlete (50 year old mother of 3) but I've run for years. So much fun to see maps and charts of your progress. Synchs very fast. Charges easily. Comfortable to wear. Lots of functionality.  My only criticism is that the programming is antiquated and difficult to understand.  It would be nice to have clear menu drops downs when you log into your Tom Tom account.
"First of all if I had seen this in person I would pay no more than 20 bucks for it. It shipped very fast but the packaging was questionable. I got it all banged up and scratched. I know leather is soft so shouldn't it have been padded in the package not just a thin plastic slip? The other thing I have a problem with is the case that hold the phone. It fits the fun perfectly but it's atachted the the phone with only glue. From inspecting it I can clearly pull back the case and see the glue and I'm sure it won't last long. I'll probably have to redo it myself. Other than those flaws the case is okay. It easily hold cards and is nice in appearance, but it could have been done better."
"I bought 4 of these car mounts. They work perfectly. The phone stays put with the magnet, and there is no need to fiddle with clamps like other mounts. I am very happy with this purchase"
Perfect charge for iPhone 6 every time
i've purchased 3 and they all tore apart in the same place.  cheap material for a cheap product. will never purchase again
Satisfied.
I needed an iPhone mount that would work with multiple sizes of iPhones and that would make it easy to reach my phone. This mount is great quality and very adjustable so you can really put it just about anywhere. Definitely would recommend
I change this and didn't work I try to reset the system and didn't helps
Works great doesn't bother me at all while I am working out or running.
Charges the iPhone 6 plus perfectly
"This cable works as expected and looks great, however it is a little too stiff."
"The metal bit that charges the ipad, snapped off in the ipad, about 2 weeks after we bought it."
"Worked for the 1st month and 1/2 and slowly the cable would stop charging my phone.I thought it was my phone so i ended up exchanging my phone because i thought it was defected. Now, its been 3 months after and they stopped working. Now the Error say this accessory doesn't work for iphone6 that i have. But now i cant even Return or exchange them because of the 30day policy.. DO NOT BUY THESE!!!"
My 10-year old daughter loves this case on her phone.  Very strong and sturdy as she has had a few slips and drops but no effects to the phone.  Grips great looks great also.
one of the grands wanted this.  they like it.
"This case was a very tight fit for my phone which in return messed up my display, the people at Sprint said for me to take it off because it was also causing it to over heat."
Love it works good!!
It's to small not worth it
Great
Grandson loves cover for phone.  Works well.
Works well on my indoor cycle
Very fast charging.  Very well made.  i bought two for a trip half way around the word.  Worked better than advertised.  Materials are outstanding.
Great Watch for the Price. I'm ready to Upgrade to a Samsung or a Motorolla for more features and Smooth operation but works good for the price.
Arrive on time.<br />Very Happy.<br />I Put myself in my phone and everything is perfect.<br />Tks...
It works great.  So nice to have a longer cord.
"I don't know what kind of a piece of junk they sent me, but I do not have a charging port and it will not pair with my iphone6.  I also have a little cord that plugs into a port on my phone, but that seems to do nothing.  I am very disappointed in this selfie stick."
Very pleased about the product
Works Great
Fit well and battery lasts for a while!
"Worked as advertised, great price arrived on time and no problems. Would recommend"
"I'm going to be as thorough as I can because I was extremely weary of third party bands at this price. I counted on reviews from people when searching, so I'd like to help anyone else out in the same sense. My band arrived on time with some other Amazon items, the band itself was inside a small plastic bag along with a screwdriver and the blue pin removal tool to take out links.<br /><br />The band looks great, feels great, and exceeds my expectations at this price point. I have a 42mm space gray Apple Watch Sport, this band makes my &#34;cheap&#34; Apple Watch look more up scale. When in actuality it was cheaper than an official Apple Watch Sport band.<br /><br />I put it on to judge how many links to remove and the adapters click into place as would be expected. I even shook it around a bit over the softness of my bed to make sure it wasn't going anywhere. I decided I needed to take out two maybe three links. I started with two and the first pin popped right out using the built in tool. The second didn't budge and the tool broke so easy it's kind of laughable. I ended up getting the pin pushed out with the pin part of a name tag, though it was a struggle. I got it reassembled and I'm pleased with it. I really actually need one more link taken out but with the tool broken I'm either going to have to see if a jeweler will do it or order a separate tool.<br /><br />Since most likely everyone is concerned with the band and not the tool, my rating reflects that. Overall I am very happy with the band itself, the only way I could be happier is if they would send me another tool to take out the one more link I need."
They sound pretty good and works well with my iPhone
The case was great for charging my phone. But when I dropped my phone - the screen cracked. Now I use an otter box and carry a charger with me.
lived Up to my expations
I love this case.  I will reorder one for every new phone I have.
My ipad is like new again this replacement part worked out really well. Saved me a lot of money on costly repairs.
I'm OCD or I would have given 5 stars
great little cell phone holster.
"VERY GOOD CASE JUST ONE PROBLEM UNABLE TO USE YOUR FINGER PRINT TO LOG IN WITH THIS CASE, HAVE TO REMOVE CASE OVER ALL VERY NICE CASE"
It burnt out after about 6 hours of use.
Good case for the phone
This case is really ONLY A BUMPER. Found it completely useless.
Decent case for the price. Much better wallet cases out there
"This case look really nice, when ordering it, but looks like a 10 year old made it, not happy at all"
"Love the WeMo switch. Works great, never had aproblem a problem so far."
"I purchased this case for my daughter for her birthday to go along with her new ipod.  She likes blue, so I figured with the blue silicone part and the pretty floral design, she would be happy.  This case is really pretty in person.  I love the design of the floral hard shell.  Unfortunately it is super hard to get on the ipod, well not hard to put on, but hard to make it look right.  The silicone part gets kind of squished up in parts so it doesn't look totally smooth and even like you would want.  We did get it, but it took several tries.  After about a month, my daughter dropped her ipod and the outer shell case cracked as well.  So, for actual protection of the ipod, it has done a good job because the silicone part really cushions falls.  But the case does not necessarily stand up to abuse - it is a very crackable plastic.  Very pretty, but I think next time I will go with something a little more sturdy.  I do really love the silicone liner, I just wish it was easier to get it smoothed on."
"Was as described, shipping was very fast."
Nice and durable! Love the design and color. The stand is a neat gadget to have as well :)
"Worked great and comfy for the price, until my iPhone 6 fell out and cracked! Since this case is made for multiple phone brands, it doesn't fit the iPhone 6 &#34;snug&#34; and has room to wiggle when not completely tight on your arm. Now I have a cracked screen. At a minimum, I would expect an armband to HOLD your phone until you manually remove it, especially if its going to be used during exercise (moving around a lot)."
Doesn't work on my 3 year old I docks
It does not get the gps signal
good
A+
"It took a little while to get here, but it's super cute! I love it. I hate carrying around big purses, so this is perfect since I don't carry around a lot of things. I definitely recommend"
"This is a terrific product!  It doesn't smear with fingerprints and even when I dropped my phone, the company replaced it at half price.  Great value for the money -- in fact, terrific value since other stores charge $50 for the same product!"
"Plugs bend up into the cube, making it a perfect cube. Masterfully simplistic design, hats off to your engineers!"
"Pros:<br />-This is an interesting device. Great for school age kids, not allowed to carry cell phones in school or are playing out of immediate adult supervision.<br />- GPS live tracking software is very accurate.<br />- Calls like a regular cell phone.<br />- Downloading the app was super easy.<br />- Device usage simple for kids.<br />Cons:<br />- Product description DOES NOT speak to: impact durability, sweat or water resistance, or temperature extreme limitations (important when purchasing a product for active school age children).<br />- Battery comes connected. DONT accidentally disconnect the battery while removing the battery packaging. It is VERY difficult to reconnect.<br />- Use CAUTION when removing the battery packaging as it contains the IMEI & ID number. (NEEDED to activate the SIM card).<br />- Setting the time was a small chore. ALL EST zone folks, you will need to manually enter (-4) in the time zone application set-up. This info is not in the directions.<br />- Directions are incredibly vague. You will have to trial and error with the phone and software.<br />- CHARGER is NOT a micro USB 5V. I repeat, the charger is NOT a micro USB 5v!!!!!!!! It is a two prong connection and I am still trying to find out what it is called."
This is second purchase because of the unit breaks easily
Great product.
Lot's of positive compliments on the design.  The case is also sturdy enough to take a fall.
Great product! Just as described.
Awesome
It was OK from a price point there's nothing that can compare. The battery is pretty great and has useful specs. I did have some trouble with att network.<br /><br />UPDATE: after 2 1/2 months the earpiece stopped working.
Awesome
"The U-shape selfie stick is compact, folds beautifully, and has a nice design.<br />Connection was flawless.<br />This guy will fit in a guy's jeans, your backpack, or purse. Say goodbye to an obnoxiously bulky selfie stick."
"Fabulously simple contraption. Goes on the wheel easy. Pops off really easy. Placing the phone in it & taking out also really easy. Can do it with one hand. One important consideration: if my speedometer was in the center & not off to the side, I would not be able to see it. All in all, really like it for when I'm using navigation or when I need to talk while driving. I ordered one for almost everyone I know."
It good
"So far no Complaints at all  I have purchased numerous different cables from other vendors for charging a house full if I- somethings, and you never know what you are going to get..  Trusted cables reached out to me asap and wanted to make sure my order was exactly what I expected, and with this Lifetime warranty that is offered, this is a NO- Brainer...  Quality Products with an even better Warranty attached to it..  I have found my exclusive source for Charging cables going forward..  would be 6 stars if that was possible.!!!!"
Love it!! Most of these cases make it hard for me to hear and take awful pics!  Not with this one!
Compact and great quality.
"I've dropped my phone more times than I can count and most times it's completely fine (and trust me, there's been some pretty bad falls). Two times, the screen has shattered. Or so I thought. Turns out it was just the screen protector. I really believe if the screen protector hadn't been on there it would have been my screen instead. This screen protector is WELL WORTH it and definitely does the job!"
great
Good product
Good
"Easy case, easy to change"
Item not received in Apple box. They were both in a plastic bag. The cable might be own but can't tell for sure since its white. The wall charger adaptor is a knock off because it has no apple logo on it and says happy on it made in China. Not what I was expecting at all.
works great.
Got delivered quickly.  I used for about two weeks now and had no problems.  Perfect length with the RC and my iPad or phone. I recommend this product.
No review
I love it. It protects my phone. Cool color
"Nice, sturdy and works like a charm. And it arrived before the estimated delivery date :)  Love it!"
Grate product!
Loved this case worked beautifully underwater ordered it specifically for a trip to the Dominican Republic and I'm so happy I got it!!!!
I am in the process of ordering this device and I am saying to myself oh what would we do without our gadgets.
This case cannot be beat for the price. I bought it specially because it was so damn cheap. Even if I never use it.
Works as expected.
Takes to long to charge
Bought this product because I thought it be a good quality coming from Samsung but when it arrived only one cord works and the other one works intermittently. Be warned there are better products out there for less.
Good for the price/minutes
"Great case, would highly recommend if you want to streamline and not take away from your already well designed iPhone"
It is great! Works wonderfully
"Wow.  Just wow.  I put PigflyTech's Google Cardboard together as soon as it was delivered.  (Advice: follow the instructions on the Cardboard itself, the included instruction sheet is a little convoluted.)<br /><br />After ordering this I went ahead and dowbloaded a number of Cardboard VR apps from Google Play for my Samsung S5. Wanted to be abke to just start using it right away.<br /><br />The QR code on the Cardboard comes up as  unrecognized by the official Google Carboard app when setting up the app.  That is fine, jt just sets this up as the default viewer.  The app that thw Android QR reader brings up looks like the official app but in an Eastern language.  Still, can use the offical and so many others.<br /><br />This is a lot of fun, PigflyTech.  Basic VR done right.  Love the actual cardboard construction and the metal ring on the left side that works as a switch/button in conjunction with the magnet on the inside.  I received this at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />Please include a head strap with this, that almost made me give Cardboard four stars instead of five.  This is great stuff, it would be fantastic if I didnt have to hold it with my hands to use it.<br /><br />This feeds the geekgirl in me.  Having a great time with it in the Insidious 3 and Virtual Tour apps.<br /><br />Came back and upped it to a 5 star rating. The lack of a head strap just isnt  enough to lose one star.  Still having fun with this!"
Great deal for an inexpensive screen protector!
"Really excellent clean, clear sound,  a cleaner sound than the Quadbeat 2 and is biased more towards the highs. The highs are crisp, the bass sounds close to normal, not really much accentuated, but it's tight and  you can get a good thump on some types of music. Great cord that resists tangling, and has no cord bang, although the mic flopping around can bang a little. But really much better than the flat cords out there.  Really great buds overall."
good one
This product will absolutely keep water out.  Sometimes when opening water droplets do get dropped inside and remain inside however it never damaged my phone.  I kept a paper towel inside to absorb all the droplets which worked.  I was not however able to use this product underwater as the touch screen does not respond when the phone is underwater so no underwater images unfortunately.  Adapts to almost any phone and very easy to use.  I also love the strap which allowed me to wear the phone around my neck.
Great case. Fits good and doesn't add too much bulk to the phone. Feels good in the hand and buttons are very responsive. No complaints about the case but where I've been sitting it down has wore some of the plastic to a white color but that's nothing major.
Cheap cheap cheap!!!! Plus it interfered with my reception
Great case i got this as a gift for a friend it perfect for credit card also if you want extra 20.00 for free check out the link http://www.mynetspendcard.com/?uref=8005772755
worst ear piece.. NOT clear BREAKS QUICK
Good
Great product! Just as described.
Works great on the go!
Works as it should. I just wish the cord wasn't so darn long.
This case is really cute and fits close to perfectly! It's sleek and fits well in my pocket without being bulgy and awkward. It looks a bit darker online but the color is still pretty and glossy. I'm satisfied with my purchase!
Received my case today & love it!!!
"Haven't had a chance to try the product out yet, but visually, appears as expected."
Exactly as described.  Arrived early.
Great product and seller!
They were wot I expected
"NICE PRINT OF OLD GLORY,LIKE IT VERY MUCH"
I love the color its exactly what I was expecting thank you
"I'm 32 and a mom of three...I.bought this for myself and I am not ashamed! :) It arrived 2 days before expected....awesome service!  I thought the color on the shield was going to be a little brighter, but I'm not disappointed...it still looks great and I'm loving it,"
Bulky and phone is too far forward.
"I just love the selfie stick! used it for the first time yesterday during my son's baby shower,  and it worked wonderfully. I actually Set it  up and took good group pictures and elevated pictures was very very easy"
"They are great quality, and the battery life is extremely long. So why one star? Because once the battery died, it never charged. I left it plugged in for a week, turned it on, first thing I hear is &#34;Low Battery&#34; then it died a minute later. I left it charging another week and it wouldn't even turn on that time."
Love it
Good quality. Can be used as clip on or thru loops. Arrived in just couple of days.
Product was exactly what expected and advertised.  Satisfied with my purchase.
I bought this a couple weeks ago and so far so good. Came on time and works like a charm. And much cheaper than other cables. Double win. I'd give it five stars but I haven't had them long enough to say if they last
my granddaughter loves this case for her ipad
"This thing is a monster!  Definitely not for the squeamish.  I think the 10&#34; tab would be right for most of the population but I like this thing a lot. The shock value alone is worth it.  Playing Clash of Clans on this with the stylus alone was worth the price of admission.  I picked up a refurbed one for $400 here on Amazon.  Great value.  I have a Surface Pro 3 with Win8 and I enjoy this more (at least until I upgrade the Surface to Win10?).  The size comparison between this and the Surface Pro 3 --  they are almost exactly the same in size, screen and all.  The only issue is I wish Samsung had a keyboard/mouse solution along the lines of the Surface Pro -- that is where the Surface Pro wins out.  Otherwise, if you want to go big, get this. I doubt they will ever come out with anything larger than this -- well, they really shouldn't but you know they probably will."
The case is beautiful but it doesn't fit my phone. I triple checked what phone it said it was for. It should fit my phone. In fact I also bought a green case from this company and that one fit! So I thought this one was safe. Very disappointed.
"Very sturdy and attractive cases. Only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the hard outer case is just that, seriously hard.<br />Putting the hard outer case on the cellphone with the other two cases requires some work. Not saying it's not well done. It just doesn't snap in with the ease I thought it should.<br />I don't use it as a clip-on. I like the extra protection and the rotating stand. That's a really cool extra.<br />Can't use the camera?<br />Sure you can.<br />I simply got a utility knife and carved out the back of the case in an area big enough for the camera, flash, and microphone. It's about 1/2 inch wide and approximately 2 inches long.<br />Bingo!<br />Extra protection in a hard shell, a better stand that rotates, what more could you possibly want?<br />I highly recommend this case.<br />It fits the phone perfectly.<br />Extremely reasonable price."
Great
"The case, while slightly pricey, does fit perfectly and is really good protection for the Go!"
"SUPER CUTE! And now everyone I know wants one, lol. It works with just about every case. AND it does not fall out."
"Yeah it fits perfect adds great cushion if your phone drops and lands on it's corners or back, you should invest in a sturdy shock absorbant screen protector also"
Slim and simple and relatively easy to keep clean. -1 star for the amount not covered at the top of the phone (only covers about 1/2 the width over the top edge of the phone).
Good quality
Arrived as expected.
"Very pretty but very poor quality, broke in 3 days."
I have a galaxy s5 and it did not fit my phone.
Ok so far... happy with it
Nice!
I would highly recommend ordering from a different company. This product will not last longer than three months; suspiciously longer that the return policy.
wrong cord
It was not what I expected and I would love my money back if i could get it. It did not come with the materials I thought it would.
Great product for maximizing the lighter outlet in my car and allowing me to charge 2 things at once.  The iSmart power control is great.
Good quality battery. Arrived on time.
Love this case. It fits and is of good quality.
"Unfortunately these ear-buds don't fit my ears, though they come with many different sizes you can try from.  I also noticed that the audio would cut in and out when only four or five feat away from the device."
Works great!
great case and service was also!!!
Didn't like it
I HATE iPhone cases but I heard the iPhone 6 is pretty slippery. Anyway this is probably as slim as you can get while still actually getting some protection from drops. I recommend this case.
Horrible.. Sounded terrible.. Buds did not work
I like how this worked and I didn't have any issues. Made me aware of my activity so I picked it p a notch.
Charger can't be plugged all the way in or it will stop charging. Seems to be a bad connection in the foldable plug.
Great product and provides fast charge on the go
great cover
Great product
Everything on this order was fine. I got a great product at a great price. Well packaged and fast shipment.
"Very cool, light, good sound, simple; I like it a lot."
Works well. Wish the bevel was a little larger.
I couldnt get this to fit on my galaxy s6
It's simple and easy to use.
Looks great!
It's was terrible didn't even drop my phone before screen cracked
"The charger is Good, but the receiber is too hot when i charge my Phone"
Fits my needs.
"After 3-4 days, this case got a couple cracks in it.  Now it is falling off.  The quality of the one I got is very poor."
fast chargin I used it in a S6 and a Nexus 5
"awesome backup battery charger. I've put this charger through the test. I live in the Desert  (92254) and out here it gets warm. this device keeps up with me, iv taken it on road trips, office use, recreation, camping, fishing (in Zip Lock bag of course) and every wear in between. my kids get it from me to charge their cell phones and tablets. this is the second Anker charger I own, first charger is the Anker Astro 5. oh and I charge them with my Anker 14W folding solar panel. and they go every wear I go. I put them in my little Bug out Bag. I recommend this to the average traveler on the go."
"this came perfect and it works overseas, i am in the uk and ordered it from the us and it works perfectly with a gsm carrier, must be one luckily i have that i would buy again if needed"
Poor quality.
Worst case ever! Not only did it not fit or connect you also couldn't charge the phone with the case on.  Basically I just caught 17 bucks on fire for no reason... disappointed!
Great price. Awesome Rockford Fosgate quality. Definitely recommend this product.
"Cases for my I phone 6 plus are very limited I have noticed, especially when it comes to cute girly prints.  This is absolutely adorable because pink is my favorite color and I love the two different shades of pink together.  I love that it's very simple to just put on and take off.  This also comes with an excellent screen protector too!  This is a wonderful phone case!  I received this at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion."
Love it
The sticky part loses its stickiness cases the holder to fall
Not good it working but the time is wrong .
"No, not for your wrists! (box cutter or razor blade!)<br /><br />While the colour of this case is fabulous you will not be able to pull down the top of your phone's screen. If you're sick of whatever you have there then this may be the case for you. Unless you feel like attempting to cut a strip about the thickness of a penny off the top of the snap-on cover piece. I myself am not fond of working with very sharp objects in small places. Especially when it's likely to leave a sharp edge. Though...  I do have lots of bandaids at home. But bloody fingers is really not a fashion statement that would work for me.<br />Oh wait! I almost forgot. If you want an impact resistant case this is not for you either. Unless you are feeling your phone is a despicable device you wish you'd never bought. Smashing it should be easy.<br />My case is going back."
"I am 67 yrs. old and a rookie at using GPS's.  I bought this to use on a trip from Missouri to Wyoming, and will continue to use it."
Perfect!
Works great with my 6 plus
love it
Best cell phone case.  Only improvement I would like is a latch so you could lock the phone int.
Too bad this arrived with a broken piece inside 😕
After a day I'm going to send it back. I can't hear the person on the other end very well and if I turn my head it makes a loud noise.
"It charges quickly, 5 to 6 full charges, and still have power. I love it!"
"My favorite case, and I've tried a few."
Good thing it has 2 ports. There's always someone else in my car. Its good material. Charges my phone perfectly fine. No complaints. I recommend this product.
So perfect...!!!
"This is a nice small and sleek apple watch stand from Nekteck.It is very affordable. It looks really neat on your desk or bedside table. It is made from high grade and luxury aluminum alloy. Which is very strong and give the stand luxurious look. There's no assembly required. Just take it out of the box and start using it.The base has 4 rubber grips, which gives the stand firm grip and it doesn't slide or move while placing the watch on it.It is a solid base for better stabilization.It is designed to charge and rest Apple Watch both 38mm and 42mm. While the watch in on the stand it has a comfortable viewing angle which i really like,Furthermore, it has magnetic charging cable which can be easily inserted and removed in seconds.It It features a circular cut-out to securely fit the charger beneath the watch.This sure is a elegant watch stand that looks great and complements my other Apple products.<br /><br />Now for packaging and shipping: It was packed in a box. The shipping was very fast. I got the Apple watch stand in two days after placing the order online.I bought it at a discounted price for testing and unbiased review.This sure is a great stand which keeps your Apple Watch clean and safe at night while charging. Plus it has a modern look and feel gives posh, sophisticated vibe to any home or office. Below are few pictures of the Nekteck Apple watch stand that i took when i first received it."
"Super happy with this little demon. Cranks power and blows our old USB charger away. Also, it has two ports, which is perfect for our busy, phone greedy family. We always seem to have one or more charging in the car. Very thankful for this well made, efficient gadget with streamlined design, compact size, manufactured with good quality sturdy components. It was delivered quickly, with no harm, because it was packed well in a strong pvc casing. Seems like a very dependable high quality item. I was very lucky to receive this lightening fast usb charger at a great discount, but my reviews are always honest, and I take care reviewing and testing products. I have no reason to make false claims or compliment a product I don't believe in. This one is no exception and I highly recommend. Peace out."
Excellent
"Exactly what I was looking for and got it quick.  Great customer service and exactly the product I needed.<br />Thanks, Jim"
Really nice quality for the price
Item as advertised. Fast shipping.
Fast  delivery A++++++++
"I do love working out and music is absolutely necessary for me to do so. I did order this sport armband to carry my iPhone 6  through a special promotion to try it and share my honest opinion. I will start by saying I got the pink one and it is a very nice bright pink so I can always find in my purse or gym bag. It is made of sturdy materials and neoprene which makes it very comfortable to wear, I have mine for hours in a day without being bothersome at all!  Super well stitched so it won't rip apart with time . has two holes to strap it so it will fit small and larger biceps. The controls on screen do work from the clear plastic, you do not have to remove it to slide it or access the apps.Great quality and I do recommend it."
Excellent
This case fit great. I've dropped my phone a few times and I feel so relieved every single time I pick up my phone and see not even a scratch. Definitely worth the price! I recommend getting a screen protector as well as they really do go hand in hand for clumsy ppl like myself! My husband also has this case and forgot his phone on his truck bumper. He found it a few hundred feet away from our house without a scratch nor cracked screen however the lcd inside was cracked! Still amazed it protected the outside of the phone!
Perfect screen protectors. Fits perfect!
WORKING ON IT
Resistant
was not the best quality
100%
I received my very first selfie stick today and am completely in love! The seller provided very fast shipping and packaged it well. I never knew selfies could look so much better. This hold my phone securely and I am able to make sure the photos are taken at a flattering angle. No more double chin or horrible pictures. I would highly recommend this to all cell phone selfie addicts it works amazing. You'll never have to worry about dropping your phone or posing weird to get a good photo.<br /><br />The company provided a sample for testing and review purposes.
It wouldn't sync with any of my iPhones and the quality seemed pretty bad.  Also the plastic part that went on your ear seems awkward and uncomfortable.  This is your typical you get what you pay for made in China junk.
"I connected the device as instructed and then found out the website had updated instructions that were the reverse of what was included in the packaging. I tried to contact the manufacturer both by email and phone for additional support and received no response after a week of waiting. That said, I don't know the quality of the product but I'm not a fan of the manufacturer based on the experience."
Fits like a glove around my phone and it feels secure.
This product does not not function properly.<br />https://youtu.be/AoBPZm8xcys
ill get a blue light flashing after a couple weeks and then its done
"This charger is exactly what I needed. I have a dashcam, my phone, and my work tablet all plugged in at the same time. The different voltage ports ensure my tablet had enough power and my phone can use the 1.0 volt port. Plus the hardwired micro-usb charger is great when my wife needs to charge her phone"
Works great!
Very handy good to have when traveling
Received in a timely manner in condition described. Happy with the quality of the product. Haven't stopped using it yet! Love this thing.
Love it! Well made! Easy to put on my phone. Great price!!
Worked good but stopped working after 3 weeks
The case does exactly as I had hoped.  I have taken my phone in and out several times and have had no problems putting it in or removing it.  It won't hold a lot of cash but it serves my purpose and keeps everything handy and together.
Definitely  the best choice . A great product at a great price!!
best BASS for your BUCK.<br /><br />amazing for short work outs where you need that music flowing through your veins for that extra push. BUT if you do longer workouts (2+ hours) the back end of the earbuds (the hard part) tends to irritates the part of the ear that secures the earbud itself from moving.
"Excellent USB port, small enough and well designed to sit on my desk, so no more diving under the desk to plug or unplug cables from the system.."
There is no way to replace just this glass as it is glued to the digitizer. I had to return this and buy the digitizer and touch screen glass as complete unit.
"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
Such a cool case! It arrived quickly and the case is of good quality. I love the design so much and is great for any Disney fan! I highly recommend.
It looks really cute but within a day the rhinestones fell off and within a week the eges started to look frayed. I'm going to have buy another case and i've only had this one for a little while
"Love it, good quality."
"Great customer service, but bad product design"
"I’m embarrassed to admit that until recently, I have had a very negative opinion about “selfie sticks” aka “monopods” aka “narcissticks.” But having reviewed a number of them recently, they’re growing on me. This one is pretty nice and simple to set up and with easy instructions illustrated on the back of the box (not sure why some reviewers have stated that there are no instructions when they are clearly printed on the box unless they received different packaging than I did). Once assembled, the pairing via bluetooth and use of the stick are easy and intuitive. Nothing to it.<br /><br />The stick comes with a USB charging cable but arrived with a charge so you can use it immediately, though it’s probably a good idea to charge it right away so that you have no interruption of use out of the box. Make sure the stick is switched to on (it will light up) and extend your stick to the length you desire up to about a yard’s length and snap away.<br /><br />The phone clamp held the phone sturdily so I wasn’t worried about it slipping out. But the longer you extend the stick, the harder it is to maneuver.  But that will happen with any stick and is not specific to this one in particular.<br /><br />Two things that could improve this: 1) add the option to clamp this in portrait orientation instead of having to try and hold the stick at the portrait angle, which makes it feel unstable; 2) add the opening for a tripod so that this can be used to sit upright on a table for skyping and facetime eliminating the need to hold the phone up with your hand, causing fatigue.<br /><br />But other than that, this is a nice quality monopod for a variety of picture taking opportunities.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion."
"Fits the lg g2 vs980 version good, the strips were not as vibrant as pictured."
It blew as soon as I turned it loud enough to hear it with some road noise. Worthless. You get what you pay for.<br />.
Never saw any liquid but somehow it leaked. I never dropped it and no cracks????? Idk. Cute for a week
"got them super quick, iv had them for a while now and the colors are still so vivid and not a single scratch on them and that's cause i drop my phone A LOT."
This screen protector has worked great on my phone. It was simple and easy to put on.
It did not work as it was advertised.
"I left my phone in my sweats and washed my iPhone 5 with this case on it. My iPhone went through all 4-cycles and after 2-years, it still works. I looked on Amazon to see if I could order this part of the case again. Now you have to buy the entire case."
"Love it, wish I had more of this type to choose from with the same great price."
get it
More than i expect excelet very happy with it Its powerfull fast big screen and touch And the price is the big deal
"I love it, however, I wished it had a volume function on the unit."
"Wow! For these items I received an amazing PROMO Code and all I have to do was write a review. Best deal ever, can't get these in store. I will shop with them again in the future."
Excellent product!
"Most useful and practical mobile phone mount for a vehicle that I have ever owned. It can be easily moved to different vehicles if the vent mount is used, as opposed to the dash mount. The phone is kept cool by the vent. The phone can easily be placed in a good viewing angle when using maps for travels. The magnet that sticks to the back of the phone is not at all troublesome when the phone is not on the mount. To me it is on the expensive side, but it should be useful for all future phones. All it takes to move the magnet to another phone is replace the two-way tape. A kit is available, but I'll simply use good two-sided tape to mount it again. Such a simple mounting system is overdue!!"
Excellent product
Love this case!
Awesome charger! Charges fast and doesn't overheat my phone.
Flexible but not quite as easy to use as I hoped. Wish it had a concealed full-width zipper pocket as well.
I bought two of these.  Loved one for 20 days and it died.  Loved the other for 30 days and it died.  I heard the same thing from friends that ordered.  Sad because the cord is nice and long. Not a good product.
"Great case, don't listen to the &#34;slippery&#34; reviews, the back is smooth but it has a rubber edge the whole way around it that is nice and grippy. Smooth clean and lightweight. A++"
Didn't work.  Not Apple
Love my ill panda buddy hangin out on top my phone..lol
Does a great job.  Charges the phone quickly.  Much better than the generic thing you'd find at a drug store.
Product came earlier than anticipated. The batteries seem to hold up just as well as the original LG battery.
It is a good quality protector and fits perfectly on iPhone plus.<br />Price is affordable as well.  I will buy it again.
I gave it Four **** Stats because the Case is Great But if you have a Tempered glass protector the case pushes agents it and makes it bubble on the edges I have iloome Screen Mate Super Thin. But I LIKE the Diztronic Full Matte (Soft Touch) Get YOU One YOU Will Like It.
"Waaaaaay better than the standard Project Fi case that comes in the Welcome Kit. It's easy to put on the phone, and can take a beating. If and when my current case dies, I'll likely get this one again."
Cool
"Great little gadget and incredibly affordable. Have used it for a month now, and my phone fell off it once which was likely due to my poor placement of my phone in aligning the magnet. Super easy to install, remove, and use.  Not bulky or ugly like other more expensive grippy ones. Totally awesome & would recommend!"
Am so impressed. These covers are even better than I expected. Perfect fit on my note 4.
"Great case, sturdy, and conservative looking!"
"I really enjoy these headphones; however, they do not stay charged long enough."
Love my selfie stick!
"Case is amazing.  Needed a case quickly as the iPhone was already dropped and need glass replaced, very happy with look and feel of the case.  Item was shipped and in perfect condition.  will most likely look for more items from this seller :)"
"While it adds a bit of bulk to the grip of the phone, it certainly does what it was intended to do: protect the device when dropped."
My husband is very pleased with this Radio Wire Harness. It simplifies the wiring of his radio in his new truck and he is happy with the ease of doing so. Highly recommend for the beginner wiring process.
Order this case for my daughter's iphone 4. It's about a inch to big. In the discription of the it clearly says it's for a iphone 4.
Stopped working after a month
very good
"I bought this battery due to a great deal on the price I saw on an Internet deal site. I didn't really have high expectations but I was very pleased when it arrived and I took it out of the packaging. It has a sleek finish, not as heavy as I expected and feels solidly constructed. I charged it and then put it to the test. I charged a Galaxy 5S smartphone from below 20% battery to fully charged 5 times! This is perfect for me when I go camping or on long motorcycle trips. Don't have to pack a tangle of chargers and cords."
This product did nor protect my screen. My phone slipped out my hand and the screen protector cracked right along with my screen.
Great
"Good connection with my nexus 4.  The USB charging port wore out, this is extending the life of my phone. Phone gets moderately war!m while charging, and I get full charge in 4-5 hours.  Orientation is easy, just center the phone and it works.  I sometimes place it in my car cupholder at an angle and put the phone on top, and it works well there too.  Significantly easier to align thanks qi alarm clock I used it with before.  Only problem is sometimes I knock it off the pad when sleep walking."
it broke in 3 days
"I was a little bit skeptical about this case, especially because my iPhone 6 is brand new, HOWEVER, the case is literally perfect. Some cases can make the Plus very bulky but this is very lightweight and slim and the stand has worked wonders for watching Netflix :) The case is exactly the color as it appears in the picture and is an easy grip! Well done Spigen, well done!"
"This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  This is a really nice quality leather wallet case.  It was easy to install and I was able to successfully put in a drivers license, debit card in a couple folded bills.  I really like how the lower pocket is see through for my license, something I haven't had with other wallet cases.  The magnet strap works well and easily slides in and out of my deep front jeans pocket.  My one suggestion would be to have the inner case that actually holds the phone, extend a letter farther to serve more as a bumper,  just in case it drops face down, while open.  Overall, very satisfied so far, And this will be my go to case when I go out and don't want a bulky wallet in my back pocket"
"weak quality, chinese...."
"Great and excellent product, protect excellent the iPhone Screen."
This battery was a total fake! It charged but couldn't hold up a charge. I was so shocked to see that my old battery of over 24 months still performed much better than this junk I purchased. This battery is a complete waste of money and time. I charged it FULLY before I started using it and it still didn't deliver any better hope.<br />My advice: Don't buy this piece of worthless junk
"I've purchased two of these so far and both times they fit perfect and lasted longer than the original! Shipping was free and it came in two days! Very satisfied, I recommend this strongly if you're in need of a new charger port cover!"
Annex products never disappoint - best case on the market !  Lucky I got it apparently annex disc. this model on their site already had the 5 retired & 6 case needed this one for a work issued 5c.
"[[ASIN:B00YCCOAMQ [Newest Version 4.0] Tronfy &#34;iWork&#34; Mini 4.0 Longest Battery Life in Minimal Sheltered Wireless Bluetooth V4.0 In Ear Headset Earbud/Headphone Earpiece Earphone w/Mic Support Stream Music/Video/Audio For iPhone 6,6 Plus,5,5S,5C, Most Bluetooth Enable Device- Apple Andriod Smartphone(Coffee)]]<br /><br />Works as expected. Once I chose the right earpiece insert it feels so natural I almost forget I have it in. Didn't need any of the added behind-the-ear holders as it is so lightweight when you get a good fit it isn't going anywhere. Sound is good. All in all a great little ear piece."
"I really do injoy haviing a charger that works good, glad you carry those kind of chargers."
worked as described.
Exactly what I wanted.
"I personally don't own an iPhone 5(S) (let alone any iPhone), but I bought this as a gift for someone who couldn't make up their mind about which case to get. That being said, they were naturally happy to receive this case because it afforded them the quality of an OtterBox case to an extent without costing as much. What makes this case even nicer, is that it has swappable plates so he can change it depending on his mood."
"The case does what it claimed...to a fault.  I was unable to be heard by callers due to the case, which made it unusable."
"Beautiful and functional ~ pockets are large enough for Galaxy Note 4, bluetooth, ID, cards, cash.  Very soft and flexible."
Very good item
thanks
Excellent Thank You..
Perfect sound like LG
"Great products, works fine"
Authentic replacement battery for the Note 3
"I was iffy when ordering this product, but i like the minimalism of it and decided to give it a shot. It holds my iphone 5s very well and i have no worries of it falling. On issue is that since it is on the air vent, it does block the air flow since the phone is in the way. Other than that, I have no experienced anything bad about the item and have recommended it to others!"
"A bit disappointed with Lifeproof. I purchased my first case several months ago, and it was perfect. Accidently dropped it in my hottub, and it was fine. No water inside. It went through a couple drops, no problem. Then I go to the use the headphone jack, and it ripped off. Purchased my second case and it failed the waterproof test immediately. My second case has survived several drops, except for the silent button which ripped off. On my third case, and it's fine(except for the waterproof test). I'm about to purchase my 4th case. I hope it's truly &#34;Lifeproof&#34;this time. Otherwise! I 'll take a refund."
GOOD
"fast shipping , easy install"
I tried the quick charge on my tablet an it work great. It gave me the extra boost that I needed.
"The cord stopped charging my phone after about 2 months of use. I was super bummed because it's held up really well except for the fact that it doesn't charge my iPhone 6 anymore. I've tried it all- different wall blocks, taking the bottom of my case off, using it with my laptop..nothing works about it anymore."
"After using it as charging cable next to my night stand because of it's length. I started to notice that it would not charge my phone. I was never rough or neglecting it in any way. Upon further inspection I noticed the end that plugs into my IPhone was loose. Next thing you know, it broke off. The length and durability of the cable are a plus, but the end breaking off makes the integrity of it questionable."
It works. Had one for 10 years and gave it to my niece. Couldn't go without it...
Love this item with long cord!!!
Eyes and mouth scratch off.
"Nice case,  snug fit"
There are not any better then dollar store brand.
"Thin, easy to install, fits PERFECTLY, and looks GREAT!  Like many iPhone users...I've tried many cases.  This is the new gold standard for me.  Not intended to withstand crazy abuse or for the user who regularly drops his/her phone.  But for the 90% of us who carefully handle our phone....this one works great."
Fits and protects my  nine year old's grandson's Samsung Tab 4. He loves it.
Works fine
Not pleased with this purchase. Comes with two protectors and first one the punch outs weren't aligned properly and would needed to be put on phone crooked. Second one lined up good. Bubbles were minimal and easy to remove. My problem was that it left a blurry look to the screen. Expected from a film protector I suppose. Rubbed nail on protector lightly to remove last bubble after other methods didn't work and it ripped right through. Customer service was good though for replacement.
It is what I was looking for with the flexibility and waterproof.
Pretty darn good for the price.
Great product - real leather - you can tell a difference!
They were great for the price.
"I bought one. It worked. I bought a second one for another vehicle. It didn't work, so I switched the two. I used the second one and it caught on fire. I burned my hand. Luckily, me and my kids are okay, and so is the. Vehicle and $900 phone. The original one fell apart the same day as the fire. Don't waste your money!!!"
They work great.
Poduct seems to be of good quality but doesn't lay down all the way on my phone and leaves an air pocket on the uper right hand corner.<br />the screen is super clear other than that.
"A metal stand sized for larger cell phones and tablets.<br /><br />The sturdy aluminum construction has Apple's aesthetic and will look at home in a modern workspace. Having the phone standing up lets you check for updates without picking up the phone (especially with wave-to-wake devices like the Moto X), or maintain the correct angle for photo/video (eg, Facetime). For visually-cued people like me, it also provides a convenient \\""everything in its place\\"" spot for my phone.<br /><br />[ A free sample was provided to me for review. ]<br /><br />The stand's display angle is adjustable, and it locks firmly in place (except when the hinge button is pressed). There are rubber bumpers on the angled part of stand and on the bottom to keep things in place. The stand doesn't display and branding.<br /><br />It's a good fit for my LG Nexus5, where I prefer the phone in the horizontal orientation. For phones under 5\\"", I'd worry the metal of the stand would interfere with the wireless signals (ie, when the stand overlaps the edge of the phone to any major extent). For those of you with larger phones or tablets, this stand is Recommended."
works great
The armband is fantastic for the Galaxy S4. It's everything one would want in an armband. It's great that there is no plastic screen cover so it's easy to actually use the phone while it's in the skin. They did however include 2 screen protectors with the product which is really cool. I highly recommend it for those who have the S4.
Does not stay on
Great cheap phone holder. Stays in the vents well and doesn't scratch them. Will buy again if I accidentally leave this in a rental car or something.
Works perfectly
Bought this 11/2014 and has worked great for nearly a year.  Would buy it again.
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!
Fits well and looks great
"Had it for almost 2 months, noticed after a month it got a huge air bubble on the bottom left, right on the corner. I guess it lost it's stickiness. Then just today it got scratches a butt ton from my iphone case. So much for anti-scratch. For the price it's fine. But I wouldn't pay full price for it."
I cleaned my band due to getting dirty & unfortunately my band has now turned white and I am very unhappy about that.  The color also started coming off during my cleaning.
"It fits perfectly, excellent purchase."
"Love this case, works great!"
Love it
"I've had the Quick 2.0 charger for about a week now and have been very pleased with it.  I've charged my iPad Air, my HTC One(M8), my wife's iPhone 6+, an LG G Pad, and a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge.  They all charged very quickly without any issues.  The micro USB cable that comes with it may be a little short for some people, but it was perfect for me.  I had to supply my own lightning cable for the Apple products."
Affordable and sturdy case.  I've had no problems with screen sensitivity either.
Perfect for my daughter who is away at college.  Thanks so much!
"I am very sorry I purchased the Nuvi 56 LMT.  The screen glare often reduces the unit to a listen only GPS .If you go on the internet you will see many anti glare hoods being offered to try to fix the problem.  Regretfully I was unaware that such a problem existed.<br />Many common words are mispronounced, e.g. bridge is pronounced as badge  and some street names are so badly pronounced they are beyond recognition.  Unlike my older Garmin unit the Nuvi 56 sometimes has a time lag informing you of the next up coming street name.  This will happen if the distance between the streets is not long enough.  I will using my i Pad mini GPS.  I would not recommend this to anyone at any price."
=)
"Works well, its a bit thicker then the original but still works very well!"
I Like  this Headphone but if you  seed them in  for repair or  get replacement it will be a Long Time before  you get them  back. I'm still  whating for  my  to come back. If  I  what in  longer I  my  go  BandO  Company for My Headphone. I really  like  the  Headphone But  whating a Long time  repair or and replacement Thats  not  Good for me when  you  pay  this kind of money  for  high End Headphone I  was  hoping  gething repair or  replace meant to be fast
good
"I bought this so I could simultaneously charge my Android phone, my wife's Iphone, and supply power to a car Dash cam.<br /><br />Because of the power draw of the three devices, as well as the length of wire needed to reach the dash cam, I really wanted to be certain that any three or four port charger was going to deliver high amperage and consistent to spec voltage to every device.  This works perfectly for my three devices, and I'm confident that I could even charge a fourth demanding device on the spare usb port!<br /><br />The build quality is reasonable for the price.  The device doesn't have an internal fuse, which may or may not give you pause; I would have liked to have a fuse on it preferably of a lower amperage than the fuse in my car's fuse box, but many prefer chargers without.  The reasoning I've heard for not having a fuse is that there is one less piece to break or lose if you continuously plug and unplug the charger.  That isn't my use case, but I respect that judgement.  Since it is a toss up as to whether this detracts from the device quality, depending on the tastes of the user, I can't deduct stars for it.<br /><br />It fits snug in the two 12v power points within front armrest and rear passenger cabin in a 2014 Chevy Volt, and is very awkward to use in the top of dash cubby 12v power point.<br /><br />Since I live in central Texas (aka 102 F summer weather,) I want to especially note that this device doesn't run noticeably hot, even when burdened with full charging loads from 3 2 Amp devices.  Every additional input of heat into the cabin of my car can make a difference, so I'm glad when something doesn't burn with the fury of a tiny 12v powered sun."
Not much to say.  It's a 12-inch SAE to USB cord so you can charge devices with a USB cord.
I will be returning both of the pairs that I ordered.  I will be listening with them and all of a sudden the volume shuts off.
It was exactly what I wanted with fast delivery.
Great quality and reminds me of Tiffany &co
Work very well.
love it perfect thank you.
Great screen protector!
Expectacular
Works great
"This has to be by far the best screen protector I have ever used - aligns perfectly to my Zenfone 2. This was the FIRST time in my life that I've installed a screen protector without any air bubbles or dust, and the pain associated with them. Very happy with the purchase, and at a great price."
"Works as described, but does come off easily."
"For the money very functional, with the foot lengths very useful for nightstand and other hard to reach places. A bit long for connecting to computer but nothing a tie-wrap won't fix."
Awesome case. Just wish screen protector was a bit more durable.
"had to return them, their range in a city or any place with any sort of obstacle is about a mile!"
Charges and transfers without issues.
I really love this case it is made out of what looks like real wood but the only bummer is that it does crack easily the first time i dropped my phone it cracked which is really a bummer i only had it for 3 days!! I do have to say it is very protective because i dropped it down my stairs and i really thought it would crack but it didn't!!
I got a lots of bobbles.too bad
Hits hard great amp!
"I liked having a device that monitored my sleeping patterns and daily steps everyday but unfortunately, the UP 24 was just not designed properly. The small cap/mode button fell out after 3 months and once that happened the silver cap with the Jawbone logo wouldn't go back on properly. I contacted Jawbone and they sent me a replacement and guess what? The same thing happened almost 3 months to the day as well! I'm so over this wristband, its just poor design. In addition, this 2nd replacement wristband its silver cap started scratching my wrist and gave me a bad rash. I took very good care of both wristbands, never getting them wet so I can only imagine how much worse it would have been if I wasn't so careful with it. It's a shame, that they would continue to sell this model and allow people to waste their hard earned money. I'm looking into the Fitbit now."
Great product!
It came on time. I like it.
Good product.  I have had many bluetooth before and this is one the best value.
perfect
Excellent Product! Ordering was easy. Shipping was fast!
Doesn't work with my HTC
Fast shipping. Solid product.
Very good stuff
Perfect
exelente
"The duration of the batery is excelent, eight days, i really like the pebble market, a great election cost-benefit"
THE PROTECT PLASTIC  IS BEGER FOR THE BLU PHONE. SO I HAVE CUT SOME OF THE PLASTIC.
Great charger and would recommend this product to anyone!. It has a small charging cord and pouch. Worth its weight in gold!
installed battery and worked great for a few weeks but now wont hold a charge. not worth the hassle of return shipping charges. should have listened to previous reviews
"These are the best earbuds I've ever used, and trying to use any others feels dull after using these for months. Their quality is great, volume is perfect, and are comfortable on the ears. That being said, the only inconvenience is that I haven't had mine for even a year and they've stopped working. However the price is cheap and quality great, so I will willingly purchase new ones every 6 months if I have to. I highly recommend these earbuds."
"Worked well, but now has problems"
Perfect fit and looks good on my stainless steel with the modern buckle of the Apple Watch.
"Used this product on multiple cell units and all have performed well. Unfortunately, with the LG Flex 2 I am experiencing trouble keeping the shield intact near the ear speaker and the left edge of the face. I am very cautious to thoroughly clean the glass prior to mounting so I suspect the shield is simply too close to the edge and my protective case may be pushing against the edges. Regardless, the shield does an excellent job of buffering the daily barrage of jabs and pokes these cell units are subjected to. Will continue to use this product on my own and other family members cell phones..."
Works great
Sometimes picks up other things... Otherwise cool and nice to have.
"Great stock replacement for my iPhone. I ordered this knowing that it is always good to have a back up cable, then the day after it arrived my original cable was stolen. Thank goodness I bought this. It works great!"
"Good sturdy mount, hold my s5 like a champ!"
This product does its job well. It extends far enough to take the picture how you want it to and the pairing process was extremely simple. The thing I like the most is how portable it is. I would recommend getting this selfie stick if you need something that is quick and easy.
Great product. Just as described and delivered in the time offered
great case; well made; fits tight.  I think I may be one of the last people who do not own a smart phone but I am very happy with this model phone that I own as long as I can still find the accessories that I need.
Very happy with my order. It far exceeded my expectations! Thank you.
"A bit bulky, but works as expected...also the key pocket is very small..."
"Actual JL grilles.  Works good as a protector for the sub, but it dents easily."
I had issues with my first case and was able to troubleshoot very well with the company. After we couldn't find a solution they resent me product for free and now I have a case that is awesome and I love it. So not only is the product great but the customer service was amazing. Thanks :)
good
Overheated my phone about half the time. Turned my camera on several times and took pants or jacket pocket photos even though the cover was closed.
Beat phone I have owned to date
This is not at all a case worth for iPhone. The first day itself the plastic coating started peeling off. I had a spigen case but it's kickstand was broken so I was looking for a new one but this has been a disappointment.
Bought it for the higher capacity over another brand that is less amps... this one was worse. Did not hold a charge as long as the phone itself. Would not buy again. Not as easy to take the phone in and out of the case.
"looks cheap very disappointed, threw it out."
I haven't learned how to fully use it 😆<br />But this is awsome wonderfull_ th you.much thsnks
"I spent the extra money on this glass screen, because I expected it to withstand scratches (as advertised). This evening I knelt down to tie my shoes and my phone slipped out of my breast pocket and skidding about 8 inches across the sidewalk (screen side down). As I said I was only kneeling, so the total distance the phone fell was no more than a few feet. I picked up the phone and was surprised (disappointed) to see a long scratch mark across the entire length of the screen. I tried polishing it with the included cleaning cloth, but to no avail - the scratch is permeant.<br /><br />Save your money and purchase a different screen protector - that way if it gets scratched you can just replace it without losing the bank."
Works great.  Freed up a lot of space in the power strip since we don't need all the chargers now.
very great quality
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
Great wallet case. Nice n simple
Very loud. easy to work. Lasting battery.
"This is weird....it does not fit my HTC1, Its to small."
"I drop my phone a lot and this keeps it looking like new, second case from Spigen, truly a quality brand and a good look for your phone. Excellent."
Exactly what I needed. Fit perfect and the install was a breeze.
"Great product, this shield is much cheaper then anything anywhere else and works just as well!"
"This is a nice case it's ashamed it couldn't my G4 since it is design for the G4 Stylus which is bigger than the regular G4. Overall the product have a solid build and the extras, will let's just say we all love extras. The screen protector and stylus pen were welcome freebies. I question why it didn't fit my G4 and the seller wrote back informing me it was for the Stylus. I the seller offered to replace my case with a refund or with one that fit. I told them no I would keep this one, even though I have no use for it. DON'T JUDGE ME PEOPLE! LOL I just enjoy the look and the feel and for that price I could afford to take the hit, you never know when you would get another phone."
LG It worked OK but it need glue to make everything work right
"So handy for reading with my Galaxy Note 5.. I wanted a small, heavy unit that would not tip with the weight or height of the phone. This fit the bill perfectly. I love it"
Does not have bumper put the fake glass over your screen and put this case on and your Iphone 6 will be classy a.f
Lots of fun.  I get comments on this cover all the time.
4 stars because it cracked while I was trying to get the air bubbles out with the included tool. Good customer service; one e-mail and a replacement was on the way to me. Hopefully the new one will last longer.
love it
Tough case
"Haven't dropped it in water yet, but did test it in the sink before putting my phone in it. The first time it had a small leak but realized I didn't have it all pushed together so tried it again and no leaks. Seems to work as advertised."
"Best made and my second purchase for my Daughter.Excellent reception, noise reduction and fit. You can't go wrong with this one."
"I'm very pleased with this little subwoofer solution.  I needed something that would be compact and out of the way, plus I really just wanted a little bit of bass to round out my listening experience.  This seemed to be a really good fit for my criteria and the price was definitely right.<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars because the sound could be better.  The response could be a bit tighter, it's a little flubby or loose in the low end.  All things considered, though, I'm still very impressed with it.  It's plenty loud and it really brings out the punch in a kick drum, which is mainly what I wanted.  Just make sure you take some time to mess around with the settings (don't forget about the settings in your cd player!) to find the optimal sound for you.<br /><br />Also, I purchased the BOSS Audio KIT2 8 Gauge Amplifier Installation Kit which provided me with everything I needed (and more) to get my subwoofer set up.  Set up was easy enough that I was able to take some tools to work the day that it arrived and install it at the park.  I've been using this for over a month now and I would recommend this to someone who just wants a tasteful amount of sub-frequencies in a small foot print."
"It works, it is cheap, and it is a great value considering the price."
"Great battery case! Better than Mophie. Bought 2, one for me and my wife and we both have never run out of power ever!"
camera use
"This is a great case for the price. OR, it's a great case that is not insanely overpriced! The soft/hard two piece design is very good for avoiding damage.  I like the kickstand, wish it was about 1/2 inch longer, making the unit stand more vertical.  All of the small holes line up just right. Don't spend $40 for a hip dude case, unless you just really like paying too much."
Plastic is a lot more flimsy than I thought it would be but the case was too cute to pass up.
"Love this case on my Samsung Note 4, and even my 15 month old grand baby has not hurt the phone as many times as she has dropped it. Does exactly what it says, protects your phone."
This case is not only stylish but very functional. It keeps my phone protected from scratched snd I find the magnet to be bery secure.
Very Satisfied!
Excellent
Great product.
"So far so good. I've had this on my Samsung S5 Active since it arrived this past Friday, so 3 days now. I ordered one for my wife as well, same so far. As far as the shipping, I have prime, so as with most everything else that's prime eligible, it arrived within the two day shipping time frame."
"Stopped working 5 days after receipt.<br /><br />Motion sensors never worked, night time recording involves activating an LED light that blinds you if you're driving by producing a glare on your windshield, never really was happy with how it functioned even before it stopped working.<br /><br />Would return but opened electronics aren't eligible for returns, so I'm looking for a reliable dashcam that isn't ridiculously expensive again."
"Nice case - simple, clean and lightweight. It fits the phone very securely, and I haven't noticed that the case hinders the use of any of the controls.  If you are looking for a clear case for your device, this one is very good!"
Fits perfect with all the buttons aligned. The hard case incloses a basic silicone case and the colors are as shown.
Do  not  waste  your  time!!!!!!
Like this very much.  Very easy to install.  It is ridiculous that the shipping and handling cost more than the item itself.  Hence four stars instead of five.
"***First off, I would like to preface this review by stating that I received it for free upon agreement that I would provide honest feedback on the item.<br /><br />The charger arrived one day after ordering...so once again, I was super impressed with Amazon's wonderful shipping. The charger itself is self-explanatory to use [plugged it into the cigarette lighter adapter] and it is a lot smaller than others I have come across which makes it convenient to use and/or store in the glove box (or middle seat compartment). It recognized and connected to my iphone as soon as I plugged it in and as far as I can tell, it works quickly. Since I haven't used it much I only gave it 4 stars, as I cannot say anything of the longevity of the charger or the charge it provides, but my initial impressions were very good [I plan on updating this over time :)]. The only minor thing that might be a nuisance is just that while the metal portion of the charger provides a sleek and sturdy look, hot weather makes this area really hot too and it's right where you would grasp it......but again, an almost inconsequential aside to a very well made product."
"I've been using this case for a few months now and while I have never really dropped it enough to truly test it, I have no complaints. It's easy to slip on and off, while also adding minimal bulk to an already good sized phone (iPhone 6 plus). My only one small complaint is that the back plate feels like it isn't completely connected towards the bottom."
Phone overheated with this on. but still a good purchase.
Case doesn't snap well. Pops off easily and have to restart phone.
Dad loved it
So far so good!  One month in and it looks and feels good!
Wonderful!
nice as expected
"My cable, when connected to an iPad or iPhone it clicks endlessly at times. It requires that the label face front, otherwise it will not change. Garbage Do Not Buy!"
"I just tried to connect, and the connector that is inside the cover lifted off and was loose inside it. Im from Panamá and the only think that they can do is a replacement or a refund only if I send back the product, it will cost me more to return it. What a shame I was thinking this will be a good product"
Stopped working after 6 month.
"This device is designed for the high-speed charging of a Galaxy S6.  I cannot speak to this claim.  However, it states that it is adaptive to work with other devices at their rated charging capacity.  This appears to be essentially true in all my tests.<br /><br />My primary phone is a Galaxy S5. The original charger essentially charges at the rate at just under 1 minute per percent of battery life when charging from approximately 50% charge. I have used other chargers that the phone identifies as &#34;slow&#34; and asks me to use the original charger.  This charger is NOT identified as slow and chargers the phone at just about 1% per minute from the same point of  discharge.  It is slightly slower than the original Samsung charger but pretty darn close.<br /><br />I also tried it on my Kindle Fire HD.  My Kindle Fire generally took overnight to charge with the &#34;normal&#34; chargers (generally less than 1 AMP).  So I purchased two &#34;high-speed&#34; chargers to deal with this and as backup chargers for my S5's charger..  The two other chargers are the Amazon 2.0 watt charger and an Orico usb fast charge with two usb ports - a high-speed and a &#34;universal&#34;.  Here are some quantitative test times using my Kindle Fire HD.<br />Amazon 2.0 Watt charger: about 13% in 30 minutes<br />Orico high-speed charger via the fast port: about 13%  in 30 minutes<br />Stalion charger: about 13 % in 30 minutes<br />Stalion charger with longer Kindle Fire HD cable: 13 % in 30 minutes<br /><br />I also tried this charger on my very old droid bionic.  The bionic charged from 15% to 30% of its battery in 30 minutes. That seems comparable to or better than I remember it charging when it was my primary phone. this speaks to the adaptability of this charger.<br /><br />Lastly, I tested it to charge several Apple devices.  Again, no extra speed but no charging issues.<br /><br />Overall, I find this to be a decent and capable charger.  The most significant shortfall is the very short usb charging cable -- Just 20&#34;!  Although this is annoying, If you have the original charging cables for your devices or other quality usb cables, there is no reason to not use them.  I did find that with my other high speed chargers (2.0 Amp), you can definitely have poor performance with some older usb cables.  If you are havingcharging issues, do not rule out the cable as the source of the problem.<br /><br />The last two points I want to make.<br />1) I did receive a free produce in return for this review.<br /><br />2) I have purchased other products from Stalion and I have easily and successfully utilized their warranty service.  This produce comes with a 2 year warranty and I think that is great since I know that they stand behind their products.<br /><br />I took one star off for the short cord. Otherwise, this appears to be a solid product with a great warranty.  At the list price, I think it is significantly overprices.  However, I have see in on Amazon in the $14 price range which is comparable to or cheaper than other  high speed chargers."
"Came quickly through the mail and is exactly as pictured. Was easy to put on and is easy to remove. Fits my Samsung Galaxy Core Prime perfectly. Cute, good quality phone case for a good price. Very happy."
good ! my best
As offered
My backup power is ready whenever I need it. I recharge my table twice while traveling with easy.
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
Good product and customer service
The case performs well in protecting my Lumia 640 xl. Haven't tried the belt holder as yet but I am satisfied  so far.
"I've used this dashcam for a couple of weeks now and while the camera itself is great, the power adapter that comes with it is so unshielded that it actually interferes with the FM radio in my car.  I've tried moving the cable around and other solutions but no matter what I try as soon as I plug the adapter to the camera or any device, it immediately kills my radio reception across multiple frequencies.  I switched to using a different USB car power adapter and the interference went away, so it's definitely the adapter that came with the camera."
It's a great screen protector but like others have already mentioned the little tabs on the corners eventually peel up. These really should be sold in a multi-pack because you'll end up replacing it every month or two.
Ok
Excellent product.  Bought 3 for a vacation where I would be away from power sources.  There worked far beyond expectations.
Was exactly what I ordered. I am quite happy with my cover.
"AAA+ Seller & great product, highly recommended for Gen1"
Great product to organize all of my cords.
"This is a small form factor, well designed phone charger. I keep it in my work bag just in case my iPhone dies and I can't get to a power source. This is small enough to put in your pocket but, you will know it is there. It will juice up an iPhone 5 from 1% to 100% in about 30 mins or so and only once. But, that is exactly why you would want this. This is one full backup charge in a small package."
So far so good. I really like the fitness phone holder. My iPhone 5S fit well in it and it was easy to put on my arm. The material kept my phone from getting damp. It arrived quickly.
muy buen producto
Bought the case and it was exactly what I was looking for. I'm very happy with the case and it was quickly received.
"UNU supplied me with this product to evaluate & review here.  Like many review readers, I watch for freely offered merchandise, expecting an outstanding analysis because the reviewer wants more stuff.<br /><br />Anyway, the UNU SUPERAK portable battery is exceptionally nice.  It's 5000kmAh (milliamps - iPhone 6 carries 1,810mAh battery, by contrast the Samsung 6 Edge a 2600mAh, & the Samsung Note 4 a more substantive 3200mAh) capacity, at full charge, can theoretically &#34;recharge&#34; any of the phones mentioned above, some twice.  Chargers like this, whether Anker, a fine maker of portable batteries, or this UNO PORTAPAK, hold a charge a long time, weeks in fact without being topped off.  I like the small charger size, it slips into my back jeans pocket, but with a bulge in that it's 3,75&#34; long...but about an inch wide.  It's more an issue for jeans pockets than a suit coat or purse. Great size in cold weather, multi-zippered coats.  I've already charged from near empty...my Samsung Note 3, and of four LEDs on chargers side (to suggests available charge), 3 of the 4 lamps were out.  That's not bad for the heavy 3200mAh Note 3 battery to filled.<br /><br />Here's the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;·sis·tance. The charging cord which comes with the battery has a standard USB male plug on one side, and a WONDERFUL &#34;piggy-back&#34; arrangement of MICRO USB (Android, etc.) with an attached LIGHTENING interface for someones iPhone. The two tips are attached by a small piece of plastic and always there in whatever flavour you require in the moment.  This feature alone is worth the savings in aggravation of 'whose got a micro cable??? NO...that's for my iPhone!!!.<br /><br />This is especially handy and offsets my uncertainty about charger shape. There is both a MICRO and STANDARD outlet on the end to allow powering and charging options of every sort/device.  This accompanying cord would have been wonderful were in somehow attached to the charger...eliminating the need to carry two things...and a small carry-bag would have been a nice touch as well.<br /><br />But for a very fair price, right here on Amazon when available (which should be shortly - after reviews finish is my guess), and the 5k power and compactness...ADDED to the piggy-back MICRO & LIGHTENING interface availability, you simply cannot lose here.<br /><br />If you have family with both iPhones & Androids...this is a grief saver!d to carry two things...and a small carry-bag would have been a nice touch as well.<br /><br />But for a very fair price, right here on Amazon when available (which should be shortly - after reviews finish is my guess), and the 5k power and compactness...ADDED to the piggy-back MICRO & LIGHTENING interface availability, you simply cannot lose here.<br /><br />If you have family with both iPhones & Androids...this is a grief saver!"
The only thing I would have to say is I suggest that you go and get better rca cables because the ones they give you are garbage.
The batteries would not fit into the cell phone. They were about 1 to 2 mm longer than the original. I am trying to return it to the sender
"These actually aren't too bad. I was wary due to the inexpensive price, but I got them to use with my Diver mp3 player since everyone said the headphones with that were awful (and they were). These work, but I wish that the ear pieces had different sizes- one of my ear canals is a bit different than the other.<br /><br />I found this out when I sucked it up and invested in higher-quality waterproof headphones (that cost about $70)....they had different sizes and shapes, and those definitely were a LOT more comfortable in my ears than these cheap ones. However, as I said, these cheap ones aren't awful and are a good starter set (especially if you are saving up to eventually invest in a better pair). I had them for a couple of months before upgrading, and they were still working just fine for me."
Very sturdy.
I love this case. I have gotten so many compliments on it.
Super protective 5 stars well deserved
Takes forever to charge Kindles! I should have trusted the bad reviews.
Great charger for my iphone 6.  It provides a speedy charge.
"Let me just say for starters, thank the gods for the rubber &#34;grip&#34; on the back of this case! I accidentally left my phone on the top of my car and it stayed on for a good half a mile ride (with turns).<br />All in all its a great case! It's slim, looks great, can take a hit (or drop), and what I really like is that it has a wider opening at the charge port to accommodate non Apple brand chargers."
Great case
I've had it for about a month now.  So far it has worked on my 6+  I'll update if that ever changes.
"HORRIBLE,  waited an insane amount of time and the tablet doesn't even stay in. It's loose and very poorly made! The Stylus cushion fell off within days! Definitely got what we paid for!"
it's literally perfect
Just what we were looking for!
Works perfectly.
"This is a great product that works great on android.  When connected, the media buttons work great.  If a command isn't sent for a period of time, the device times out but a press or two will wake up the remote and re-establish the connect.  I've used this with multiple Bluetooth stereos and it works great!  I normally keep this mounted on my cars steering wheel. Keep in mind that this can get in your way, so make sure you move it somewhere where it wont cause problems to your driving.<br /><br />There is one annoying problem with this.  On android, it's classified as a keyboard which means by default the soft keyboard will NOT show up when this is connected.  To fix this, you can disable the hardware keyboard, but this setting is not remembered between connections.  So I finally found a fix using Tasker and Security Settings.  When connected to the remote remote, I have a task that triggers a &#34;Configuration - Hardware Keyboard Disabled&#34; using Security Settings.  I hope this helps!"
thank you
Love my  case !!! The color was exactly what was shown and the quality is awesome! !!!
Most car chargers don't work very well. This one is great! I received a discount on my order for a fair review.
"As a protective device, this is an excellent case. However, the case is so &#34;airtight&#34; that I miss 25% of my calls because it will not slide out of the holster/clip. The rubberized cover surrounding the actual phone has a high friction co-efficent with the hard case that holds the phone to the belt that pulling it out when being called requires both hands. The result is missed calls or buttons being pushed by mistake.<br /><br />There are some places where a Fort Knox case is impractical... this is one. In the end, the rubberized section of the case is beginning to stretch and soon I will need to replace it."
front cover broke off right after opening item.  Gave as a gift.  Very disapointing!
Update: Dropped my phone and the entire case popped right off :(  So cute. Seems protective but still keeps my phone small unlike other protection cases. Seems kind of cheaply made but I still think it's beautiful and fun and will work well
Great! really scratch protective.
works as it should. A little bothering is that I have to remove a cover before plugging it in.
Went out within a month.
100% awesomeness
"Awesome delivery, fast and received as described and few extra things.  Thanks<br /><br />However case screen cracked within a month.  Booooo"
It cracked not long after putting it on. I would not order it again.
Works to quick charge a phone.
good
Great packaging and super easy to apoly to my phone:)
Did not like at all did not fit the phone and the clip was way to big
I bought one for my daughter and she loved this.  The compact design holds a lot of charges when you're on the go💥‼️
"Built materials is excellent, great 170 wide angle image.<br />Just my personal opinion,  day videos are very good. Night vision is OK, same or closed night quality as Dome G90s. G1w has a brighter night video but less detail than this R1 Pro (up to 1080 only)."
Easy to install. Not too bulky.  Fits in your pocket nicely.  Dropped it on a concrete floor with no damage to the phone.  Replacement of the screen protector is a real plus.
"This case fits my iPhone 6 Plus very well. It is perfect lengthwise, but it's just slightly too wide. I have a slim silicon case on my phone, and it moves around a little in this case, so it's not a super-tight fit. The magnetic flap closes well and doesn't flap around when walking. The material is soft and comfortable to wear. Plus, the metal clip is long enough to fit securely over my wide belt. Very pleased. The case is made of good quality leather with a leather belt loop on the back and dual leather lined belt clips on either side of the belt loop, so you can either slide it securely over your belt or just clip it onto your belt for ease of removal without undoing your belt. I love the feel of the soft leather flap that secures the iPhone soundly with a magnetic closure. It accommodates my iPhone 6 Plus with the Hybrid Bumper case on it with room to spare. So it would accommodate an iPhone 6 Plus with a larger heavier case on it if you had one. All in all, it is one of the classiest phone holsters that I have owned. As a blogger I am often provided Press Sample kits by companies, just as in this case in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own."
"Works well, does what it should. Well worth the price."
Cracked within the first 3 days.
"good protection of phone, what you see is what you get."
This is a good dash cam but there no book or  any thing on the web on this. It is teach you self.
It's works very well
very good
After two days the belt loop attachment pulled away from the case making it uselesd
The case had a defect. The bottom corner (touching the screen) would not sit flush against the phone. Case was way too bulky and very prone to dust.
"As of today, this watch is compatible with the iPhone. Download Android Wear for IOS from the Apple App Store and pair! Enjoy!"
"Easy to put on, super clear. After 8 months, not a scratch on it. Works well with Mophie battery case -- fits right in the opening. I wouldn't know it was there except for the peace of mind. And I would never have a phone without one of these on it. A small price for excellent protection."
Nice just to bulky
"I only gave it 4 stars because -- honestly -- I can't find it in myself to love a small sheet of glass (c'mon Amazon!), but this item was absolutely perfect and I couldn't be happier with it. If you've never replaced an iPad 2 digitizer before, be forewarned: this is *not* an easy job, even for a relatively experienced DIY'er. Yeah, you'd be crazy to pay what Apple charges, but if you can find a local shop that's replaced at least, say, 10 of these, you might want to consider that option. But if you're planning to press forward despite these warnings, I have a huge time-saving tip for you: It's virtually impossible for a first-timer to remove the old (and I assume, cracked) digitizer without shearing off the Wi-Fi antenna. So do yourself a favor, and buy a new Wi-Fi antenna at the same time. They only cost, like, three dollars, and it'll be the best $3 you've ever spent."
Great product for getting a nice clean signal to your amp. I especially like the adjustable gain knobs.
"Excellent product. Exceeded expectations. Awesome sound quality, BLUE tooth range, features. Highly recommend this product"
"I like the look a lot.  I had an Otterbox but could never find my phone because the case was black.  The case fits well.  I did crack the glass protector screen and am not sure it would have cracked with the other case. There is  no way to really tell but I think this offers a little less protection, is less bulky, but is much nicer looking."
Love it
Love it
perfect color for my gay personality!
Useful and easy to carry
I rarely give bad reviews but I'm furious. I have iPhone 5s and this doesn't fit properly ! There are gaps on the corners and nod the home button doesn't work! My friend works at Apple and he does phone screens all day so it's not something he did. Do not buy this junk.
Great Backup.
"Love this little radio for the porch and camping. Small size and good sound. Seems to get great reception, too. Very pleased with this product for the price."
I bought two of these after I bought this one. It's kind of awesome and charges super fast!
Free sample from AMZ.<br />Nice package and fast delivery.<br />Not hard to open.<br />Clear guide to stick on the phone. High quality of glass screen protector.<br />Very easy to make it done.
"Great product, perfect protection for an expensive phone."
This is a piece of crap.  Doesn't charge well in the sun and lousy operation...not to mention it is huge and bulky.  I wish I had read reviews on it before purchasing. Do yourself a favor...buy a regular outlet unit that will work.  Love to be environmentally friendly but this is a waste of $$!
"Great buy. It holds my phone in place tight. Simple, functional and inexpensive. Definitely recommend it."
"Although it is cute it doesn't glow at all which sucks , and from reading the other comments other people have the same issue. I'm very disappointed and if it wasn't such a pain in the ass i would send it back."
"This is my 8th time buying one of these. Not because they don't last, but because everyone always thinks they are cool and I let them have it. Love the fact that you can turn anything with an AUX input to Bluetooth!"
It works!
WONDERFUL
Arrived ahead of schedule (which was a big plus) and the product was exactly as advertised.
Great! I love my Cellphone. thanks :D so good!
"I returned this item since it overheated during the initial charging.  I had to use a towel to unplug it. At that time it still wasn't fully charged (not all lights lit.  It was a good thing I didn't just plug it in and leave it unattended.  That said, I would not have left a review if I hadn't gotten several emails from the company begging me to provide a favorable review."
Very good
"It takes the cover off of your phone when you take it off, pretty annoying actually.  I wonder if I'm going to damage my phone when i put it on or off.  Other than that it's fine."
"Do not buy this product if you are looking for an actual otterbox.  Although this product says  &#34;Otterbox&#34; it is a knock off and I could tell from the moment I opened it.  The plastic is thin and feels like it would easily be broken, the rubber is too hard and not stretchy at all.  The back even says made in china.  Real Otterboxes are made in the USA.  I will not buy any product sold by this seller.  To add flame to the fire it took over 3 weeks to arrive, and it was complete junk, I hope this seller is shut down for fraud, and faces charges for ripping off the Otterbox design and name.  Shame shame."
Love the case. Very protective
"You can see the quality and durabilty of this product. A good cable is always important too, it's not just about the charging usb outlet either."
It works.. and the door fit perfectly ***UPDATE: it quit holding a charge after a few weeks.
"This appears to be a very high-quality charging/transfer cable.  Everything is smooth and solid, fits well in the ports.  I bought it to replace one the cats chewed through during a lightning storm awhile back, I think there's a good chance this one will resist such treatment and survive.  Have to give a shout out to whoever designed the packaging, it's fabulous.  Quite welcoming, looks like it has nice jewelry inside, and customer service info is right there, easy to find, should there be a problem."
if you like 17 bubbles this piece of junk is the one you should buy
Real Apple cords
"Piece of junk, picture quality sucks, when wiring just connect red power and video and audio, do not connect black gound"
"It was really tough to put on and a plastic piece near the left side, top button broke off."
"Elegant, sturdy, protective, perfect size and good materials"
doesn't hold up well
"Nice case. Not as protective as my previous Otterbox, but I really love the slim design. Who doesn't love pretty colors?"
"i'm really happy to receive this case with a discount for review.  I tend to buy my cases on eBay but the quality is pretty sub-par there.<br />This case is really nice, well made, sturdy material.<br />It's nothing fancy but it is sturdy, well made (the stitching is fantastic!)<br />But the one thing I thought would be useless is instead the best feature, that strap!  I used it this morning at a pet adoption event (the iPad), I just happened to stick my hand under the strap for comfort and was flicking through the pictures on the iPad to show a potential adopter and was sideswiped by one of our 'moose' dogs - lost my footing but didn't fall over and realized had I not had my hand under the strap, the iPad would have gone flying.<br />We are all volunteers and the tools that we use like iPads/tablets, phones, etc  to help use show people our dogs are at our own expense and this would have been an expensive lesson for sure.<br />I came back to review and to buy a red one which isn't available right now so I'm putting this in my cart and keep an eye out for red."
beautiful!
"Yes, this article meet my expectations"
Awesome case. very durable and easy to put on. I recommend 100%. Bless yourselves with the fantastic case guys.
"Nice case, fits perfectly. My son loves it"
"Tried the Freefly VR at my friend’s house and I was absolutely blown away.<br /><br />We used it for mobile vr gaming so it was tethered to the pc and trinus gyre with moonlight used to stream to a galaxy s6 phone.<br /><br />The ease of use is a good plus. I’ve also tried the homido before, I can say without a doubt that Freefly is a lot better and I mean a lot.<br /><br />It’s easy to calibrate, more comfortable, looks very professional, awesome customer service and fast replies, you get a free controller with it, and I can go on... The only thing that the homido has and I wished Freefly had was a way to adjust the IPD, I’m not gonna lie that is a really good feature.<br /><br />Hope the next version of Freefly will have this as well! Although I must say the lenses of the Freefly are very big and a very high quality! Thanks for an awesome product guys."
Got just what I needed!
Great item!!
The best cell phone case I've every had!  Precision fit and finish.  Great protection - front and back.
One of the best peices of insurance my iPhone could have. I am a rough and tough biker and my phone is my lifeline. I have worn out my first otter box.  This is my second and surely not my last. I recommend this product over any of the other manufacturers available.  Be sure ur ordering a true otter box and not a knock off.
This is my second one.  Excellent product. Great service !!
"I really like it. It's made with good quality material. It has three pieces and a stand that can pop out. I got it with a promotional code, put it is worth the price."
Cool colors for my S6 Edge. On time delivery. Product description very accurate.
So far so good!! I feel more comfortable knowing my phone is protected to a degree.
It works in my phone and the price was outstanding!!<br />The last one I had lasted almost 4 years with charging then just started to go dead....all the time.<br />I'll keep track with this one.....even if it only lasts a year??? The price makes up for it! Ha!
Did everything as advertised; clean/minimal addition to the dashboard.
So nicely designed and packed that it looks like an Apple product<br />And it works fine
works.  durable.  no complaints.
I got it two weeks ago and the clip already broke. I guess that what I deserve for being cheap and buying cheap crap. You get what you pay for.
Just don't like wearing the heart monitor shout be like the Fitbit HR
Returned. Slow to charge and was smaller than I thought it would be.
Works great
"I experience the same problem it seems many of the other reviews had here. I bought from Groupon, it worked perfectly for a month and then out of nowhere I got the error on my phone saying it was not an Apple Certified product and it stopped working. Very disappointed."
[[VIDEOID:a45d104c2d3c1e83d7a4a573738c0c6c]] Quick review of the Apple Watch Strap Band - E LV Apple Watch 42MM - ( DARK BLUE)<br />Its not really the band i'm upset at its the adapter more than anything.
Went on easy enough without bubbles.  Does not fully cover complete front a few centimeters short on all sides.
Perfect fit for the S4!
best  selfie stick
A life saver
"Didn't fit phone at all, very cheap and poorly constructed. Don't waste your time or money."
The tablet case is wonderful.  It would have been helpful to have assembly instructions.
Fits most cases that I own for my phone that's the reason I purchased this item and it has great clear sound not cheap Materials they made it out of.
It's fits well
Awesome
Fits very well!
works fine
"Loved it at first! Recieved my second one from my dad about 4 months later who didn't care for it and got something else.  Less than a year later both are dead...I used these head phones all the time, when i worked out, in the car, around the house. Because i used them so much i was also very careful with them. They both stopped working about 2 months apart. No idea why. the noise cancelation still turns on but the actual bluetooth (headphones) don't turn on. I've tried everything i can think of but no luck. No idea where my dad got his from but i doupt they were from the same batch. I'm really disappointed in these even though i really liked them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />very comfortable and light weight. Forgot they were even around my neck many times.<br />pretty decent range<br />volume was loud enough<br />all the buttons you would need for calls or music and easy to locate(feel) without much fumbling around<br /><br />Cons:<br />2 died in less than a year<br />noise cancelation was barely noticable (never really used it)<br />low battery indicator cut out music when it sounded<br /><br />Those are my only complaints... would have been a five star if they hadn't died."
"Piece of junk. Should have spent a bit more for a longer lasting, higher quality bluetooth kit."
Not perfect but so good. Size is litter small to cover my phone but also can accept.
"Just amazing!!!! I need it to protect my new note 5 and man! it does its job, I a little bulky, but, better than other cases.<br />great product and affordable price."
"It really looks like the picture, I recommended :D"
It works as advertised.
Not as good as t I thought.
batteries don't last as long as I'd hoped.
I needed this to use my cellphone as a GPS on my bike which was already wired for the micro USB and the phone has the mini.  I wanted it tucked in so it wouldn't be sticking out asking to be bent and damage the phone.<br />They appear to be well made but the left plug is apparently missing the power wires so it won't charge the device it's plugged into.  I ordered a replacement thinking it was a fluke but in fact they both show the same flaw.
Love it! Works well love this phone and the business this seller does.
"II've had this for around a month or more now, and i love this product.  i really like the convenience of having my items in one place instead of strung all over the place like i had to have in the past.  it's easy to hook up the devices if it is done right.  i told 2 of my friends, and showed it to them, and they said that they were going to order it also since that they like how it looks, and the convenience of this product.<br /><br />yes i would recommend this product to my friends and family....."
Good case. Came early
Very cheaply made. Lasted 2 weeks then started falling apart!
The magnets are not strong enough to hold my iphone 5 even when the car is not moving. The adhesive wont stick to any surface. Don't even bother getting this!
Nice and minimal. Good grip
"Excellent product. As advertised. Patience is key however. Especially when removing the old cracked screen. I practiced on my old broken S3, so I could understand process better. Luckily I did since I overheated old phone LCD with heat gun. Using tape on cracked screen face was a HUGE help to prevent wire from getting hung up on broken glass pieces. Be sure to watch the youtube video before or during replacement."
"This is a great little charger to grab free recharging from the sun. I keep this by a window, so it continuously charges itself, so when I need to take it out with me its topped off. Its not a very rapid output, but when you can keep it ready for those times you can't plug in, its a good compromise.<br /><br />The case is covered in padding, but I don't think it could take too much abuse. I think hanging it on a bag like is shown in the directions would be ok, but this isn't for extreme sports.<br /><br />I received one of these at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
battery on phone does not last as long as i hope
Fast shipping no damage.
"It didn't exactly line up on the edges, hung over a bit. And the camera whole did not match, was off about 1/4 inch.."
very useful
Ordered this for my wife's phone.  She is very satisfied with the design and the way it fits.  It came quickly in a padded envelope
"These headphones have been life-changing for me! They are so comfortable to wear because you don't have to stick them in your ear.  They are perfect for any kind of activity, they stay put very well.  They are defintely sweat proof.  They charge quickly and the battery lasts for a lot longer than one would think.  They are easy to use and even have controls for volume, play/pause, next/previous tracks right on the ear! Whats more, they coil up and fit into any pocket or bag."
Its a good offer
I received this product free in exchange for a honest review. The case comes in a little plastic baggy. The case doesn't make your phone thicker or heavier at all! This case is super light you can barely even tell it's on there. Everything fits perfect and snug. The buttons function properly and this plastic case is not made cheaply it really is durable! Fits my iphone 6 spot on! Would definitely recommend!
Excellent product!!
Just as exoevted
"I have been using this continuously for several weeks and am completely satisfied. This is a very high quality product. It doesn't heat up at all even when charging all devices simultaneously which include multiple I phone models, and multiple I pad models. It charges fast even when all devices are connected. It is hands down the best charger I have ever owned."
"Wow, amazing guys it can't be better then this. If you have a S6 edge and looking for a screen protector plz don't waste your time just buy this. Thanks a lot for such a product"
Durable case.  Has good charge and protects from drops.
Headphones did not work. Tried to pair them wirh Panasonic home phones bought at the same time without success. Directions are poorly written. No online help. Wish there were a zero rating
Exc product
Fantastic item ....wonderful fast delivery.
It broke the minute I put it on!
This pen works very well for my Galaxy Note products.  The electronic eraser works great.  LOVE IT!
Not good falling apart already and cracks .
Beautiful !!
"Works perfect with Iphone 5s. Nice to have wallet and phone in one. I replaced the plastic phone case that came with it, with my own hard plastic case which I glued to the leather case."
This is a good tracker for the money!
Great product. I wish I had ordered one years ago. Works on my old Droid Bionic. Gives me all day use. Bought 2 so my wife would not have to charge her battery except at night. Extended back covers fits perfectly and the screen protectors and wipes were a bonus. Actually my phone is easier to hold now that it is thicker. Buy one. You will like it.
Love this case. It's solid and the back is sticky enough to use the case as advertised without also acting as a dir magnet. Some nits kf ljnt etc stick but nothing major. The back and sides offer a nice rubbery feeling in hand as well.
First I noticed that the quality of the parts in the box was of excellent quality.<br /><br />All the parts fit nicely.  I tested everything and all worked as described.<br /><br />Highly recommended product would buy again
Cool product! All work. Good to have around
Great price for a great case.  Works great and looks even better. I love that it comes with the tempered glass screen protector.
"durable case, fits perfect on my LG G4. Design and colour is a plus, i love it. Its a flip cover that surely keep my phone safe. safe for bumps too and i can easily check my time on the circle window i found it amusing, elegant and unique design i ever got. I do have collections of case for my LG but this is the unique one, once i open the flip cover it automatically brights up and ask for my password. in terms of price it is not too bad. the last LG case i got cost me $6, i am willing to throw extra $4 if it is as good as this case.<br /><br />I received LG G$ circle case by Great shield for FREE in exchange of my unbiased and honest own opinion review."
Great nice case. It took a lot to arrive but it is a nice good looking book.
"Great product &amp; awesome price! Fast shipping, product was as pictured and as described in the description."
"I originally purchased a different case for my new Galaxy S6 Edge+ but was not at all happy with it, and subsequently returned it.  Looked at this case and decided to give this a try.<br />The case arrived in 2 days.<br />Putting this case on the Edge+ phone is a bit tricky, due to it's snug fit...Especially with a Zagg screen protector on however, once I got the case on, it fit like a glove.  It's exactly what I was looking for with this phone.<br />It feels great in my hand, and the case doesn't interfere with the functionality of the Edge screen.  The rubberized texture gives just enough grip to give you a feeling of security that it won't slip out of your hands.  I purchased the red case.<br />This case looks stunning, and really contributes to the overall appearance of this great looking phone.<br />Fantastic case, highly recommended!"
Easy installation. It fits perfectly on my iPhone 5
"I needed rock-solid, &#34;can't tell I'm on a headset&#34; phone connection, and this comes pretty close.<br /><br />A few people (seems to be phone-dependent on their side) say when they talk they hear a bit of echo back. Everybody says I sound great, and they can't tell I'm on a headset. The noise-canceling feature is amazing, and I can be outside with the garbage truck coming by, and people say they can't hear it in the background.<br /><br />BONUS: If the RF signal from cell phones is somehow damaging to humans, (causes cancer, etc. -- not saying it does, just IF), having this small local signal near the brain instead of the whole cell phone should be a major improvement. The phone itself can be several feet away, happily working without damaging me."
"No complaints so far. I had feared they may not be Apple Certified, but all my devices are accepting them without any issues."
"Great price. I thought phone would come on, when case was opened up."
Omg! Where has this been all my life?!?!?! Totally in love!!! Gym time just got more exciting!!
"Charger works great, I have charged a GoPro, an IPad and iPhone at the same time, really happy!"
Very easy to install. Right size!
GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT
Its a great fit and it looks really nice!
"Battery and charger are great. There is no issues with it. I like how fast the charger is. It is well worth the money and the battery is oem. Overall,  great value."
This case is not what I had I mind it is water proof though and that's the best thing I can not hear my callers at all the screen protector is silicone so when you put it on your phone daily you have to work bubbles out
"Broke after using it for 2 days, not made very well at all. Very cheap."
It's good
I have ordered 2x and it's perfect for front pocket phone carriers and when It goes in My purse nothing sticks to the screen it's well covered.  I'm prone to drop my phones and I don't worry with this case. Although I prefer the black. I ordered green which was available that day..
cant not go wrong for this price and these are great!!
It's just a basic plastic phone back cover nothing major but if that's all you need it for like me it's protect the Phone.
These headphones changed my life. I recommended this to my professor.
Seems as though it would protect.my phone well...however..touch sensitivity was greatly.deminished.....edge.features no longer worked easily.  Removed it after one week due to frustration
Great for charging up the phone when on the road...
Works great
Great.
Thank you
It works just as quick as my wall QC 2.0 quick charger and OEM fast charger for my Note 4. I have to take a star off as it does not fit very well in my lighter socket. About 1/2&#34; of the shaft sticks out and doesn't always provide a constant charge. I have to be careful as dips and bumps can knock it out of contact with the lighter socket power. I've since rigged something up to keep it locked in place. It's not pretty but it works.
Solid quality. Feels a lot more expensive than the $10 it costs. Completely charges a iPhone 6 Plus or a Galaxy Note 5 without dying.
"They are basic, but work great. The quality of it is better than expected so far. And the magnet on it works so great, It's like it is held by a button. So far very happy with it."
Microphone did not work.Picked up a hum sound no matter what I turned oof. Sent back for refund.
"I do not normally write reviews, but I am VERY happy with this product. It arrived very quickly, sounds fantastic, feels durable, and looks great."
"good price , quick delivery."
The best product on Amazon.  We took this for our phones on our cruise.  We took snorkeling photos with our phone and not a drop inside the bag.  I tell everyone about this.
work well
good
"Delivered May 3, 2015 It does the job. (I still have it)  I have to admit my boss does not see a thing! (replace Boss to whoever you're trying to hide the screen from) but in reality i love this thing.  I kid you not!! my coworkers complain that they can't see when i'm trying to show them &#34;instagram&#34; pics.  They actually have to hold the phone in order to see what i'm trying to show them.  Caveat!!! when taking a picture high or low you won't see the screen which is a bummer but I can live with that and It's not why i got it in the first place."
Fast shipping just as described
This thing is amazing. Charges my phone real fast.
not good . keeps on falling down
"Cheap, poorly designed, keeps falling apart, junk. Within the first 5 minutes of owning this thing, the phone fell out and hit the floor. The part that goes on the phone is rubberized plastic and fits poorly. I put the rubber cover on my phone from my former I-blastin case, that helped a little. The next issue was the pin in the hinge keeps falling out, I'll bet that I put that thing back in 6 times as the clip pops out and comes loose. I sure wish that I hadn't bought two of these things, they are junk.<br /><br />No offense to the seller, that all went perfectly, but I definately don't recommend this product."
Fits well
It's a cool case and it's cute I love it I would just say block up the ends
Not too good quality sound..
"This case for my Galaxy S3 is great. It is a hard case, but the material isn't so slick as to fall out of my hand. It protects all sides of the phone, but doesn't add much thickness to the overall size of the phone - this was really important to me. And all of the cutouts for the buttons and camera fit perfectly. This is a great case and the price made it even better!"
Love the card hoder and stand.variety of colors. Fits great on back of phone
"I'm pretty new to Anker products but so far every time I have purchased from Anker I've been very satisfied. This is the best car charger I've owned. I've used up to 3 ports at a time and it works well all the time. I'd recommend this to anyone. If you're not sure, I say just go for it. You'll be satisfied! Even if you aren't... Anker customer service is the absolute best."
I constantly drop my iPhone 6 but it's still in one piece. The belt clip is awesome
Great
"Fits very well and isn't too bulky.  It has just the right amount of grip without being sticky, so it'll slip into your pocket easily, but you don't have to worry about it slipping out of your hand.  Shipping was fast, too!<br /><br />If I have any gripes at all, it's just that I wished the power button was just a little more pronounced, not a big deal though."
"Well made product. Arrived on time. Works great,"
Arrived fast. Good product
Works perfectly
Few weeks now and still working great
"Case didn't fit and, yes, I ordered the correct one. Contacted seller to return. Never got a reply."
Earphones were staticky when plugged into the earjack - def not worth the money - returned my item and got a refund.
Works perfectly!
The item worked great for two months.  Now the Bluetooth transmitter only sends out a mono signal.  Now I cannot use it for my main purpose of watching TV late at night when I can't sleep. The equipment was always used gently. It appears that the product is not made sturdy enough. If it had not broken I would give it a 5 star rating.
This is really cool and does what it is supposed to do. It seems quite durable!
Love it !
Cute
Good thank
Worked great but you can't use your phone in hand while it's charging because it has to lay flat on the surface. Good for overnight charging.
"Great small size. Good feel, a little slick, but enough grip.<br />However, the &#34;leather&#34; starts peeling away from the corners after just 1 week of normal use (in & out of pocket)"
This is what it says..... waterproof but NOTE:....IT DOES NOT FLOAT.  If you are looking for a floating case you need to look further.  I was not thinking about that and guess I assumed that it would float.  I cannot hold that against the product as it does not make any claims as such.  It is what it says and the price it right. Good product.
"Love this cord and the company.  When my cord suddenly stopped working, I contacted the seller and they were very helpful and promptly replaced the cord with a new one.<br /><br />I have not had a problem with the new cord."
"looks like an iphone otterbox, but doesn't fit at all.  we had to tweek it to get it to fit. wouldn't buy it again."
Great valueg
awesome. You can adjust to whatever length you want and it will lock then you can rewind from that position with a little pull of the wire. You don't have to extend to full length to rewind like others. Good design.
"Great product, love it"
"I recently bought a new iPhone 6Plus with a Lifeproof Nuud case, based on the recommendation of the Verizon Saleswoman. The LIFEPROOF was a complete & expensive waste of $$MONEY$$. No one could understand what I was saying - they said I sounded like I was underwater.  THEN I ordered WILDTEC as a replacement. WOW, compared to the $110 Nuud, WILDTECK was a steal! Easy to install AND more importantly everyone can understand what I'm saying now! ONLY one small concern, the APPLE Lightning charging cable, is a very, very tight fit thru the case port. IF you don't mind trimming or shaving aftermarket cable connectors in order to fit, this IS the case for you! I am a happy customer!!!!! Thanks Wildtek...."
"Everything fine, nice & useful as expected & good delivery service..."
One of my favorite cases I've ever owned!
"Works well, Looks great and so far, its very durable!"
Item as described!
Doesn't fit my phone very well.
Absolutely love this case exactly what I wanted and needed. The leather is perfect and I'm grateful for amazon's existence very cheap it would of cost a lot more in a store.
"This is a very compact selfie stick and feels good in your hand.  The quality seems good for the price and I think it should hold up nicely.  I wanted a hard wire shutter version because I don't want to worry about if it's charged when I want to use it.  However, only time will tell if the wire connection at the head will hold up over time.  Yes, I would recommend this product to a friend."
"I bought this for my hubby's birthday. He recently purchased a Subaru WRX STI, and I figured the $70 would be a lot better spent on a radar detector than on speeding tickets lol! It works fantastically after he got it positioned properly on his dash, and is easy to read and  hear. Once you get used to it, you don't even have to look at the detector anymore, because you can determine what alert it is by the sound out the beeps"
Does not fit in the CD slot as well as others. It causes any device I place onto it to jiggle while driving or idle. While most of these on Amazon are virtually the same; I'd rather spend even a few more dollars on anther brand.
It broke with less then a month of use while holding a gps going down a smooth paved road. Waste of money.
I have been concerned about radiation (EMF and EMR) for some time now. This product blocks the radiation and was inexpensive and effective. I am very satisfied.
"The case itself is rather cute and it covers all four sides with none of the corners peeking out like some cases have. The bumpers are a bit thicker than my previous one as well, but it could definitely have a bit more padding around the edges. I do have an issue with the case though, the rubber part doesn't fit as snugly as I hoped it would at the top and bottom. I found it to be weird and it does raises some concern. Thankfully, the plastic fits around the cell and rubber case snugly."
Although lots of people liked it. It did not work with me. I charged it and connected it to my iPhone 6. It worked first then stopped working the second day. Whatever I tried I wasn't able to turn it on anymore.
Disappointed that a screw popped out during first use. It still works but I would order another brand.
My favorite case. I really like the stand so I can watch all my shoes.
Need to send back<br />It does not connect
Sucked. They worked great the first time I used them. Plugged them in the next day and didn't work at all!
Not even worth one star!  Did not work straight from the package.
"Way to expensive for what it is and does. Scuffed soon as I put it on, huge white mark across the whole thing. Waste of money"
THIS IS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.  I NOW FEEL SAFE HOLDING MY PHONE ANYWHERE.  AND WATERPROOF TOO.
Protects your screen from scratches while giving it that smooth glass feeling. I'll never go back to plastic screen protectors.
ENJOYING THIS
I received a discount on my order for a fair review
It was great everything i wanted in a phone case
It took almost 2 months but I got it tested it out before installing the phone and no leaks perfect also the kick stand is very flimsy but it's awesome
Phone fit; magnetized strap leaves a lot 2 B desired!!!!!
Very good product. Does exactly what you said. It literally doubles the battery. This case is amazing.
My son loves these
Bargain!!!
"Charged did turbo, but it takes about 8 hours. Not a turbo charger"
Poorly made...cheap
Awful. Never even put it on my phone.
"MAN! I LOVE my Pachyderm!<br /><br />I've charged my iPhone twice today (it reached about 20% one of the times, and 30% range the other). Hooked it up to my Pachyderm charged it right up (and fast too! Just about 30mins).  The Pachyderm battery, after using it twice is at 75% charge left. That's incredible!!<br /><br />Highly recommend getting this! It's thin, light-weight, sleek appearance.  You can slip it in a purse, or pack it on a trip! Now I don't have to worry if my hotel room has enough plugs for my iPhone and Laptop!"
"When the product works it is great. However, it has been a pain to try and figure out why the speaker won't work. Only have had the item 4 days. Worked 1 of those days so far."
Worst purchase I've ever made !
"This is just what I was looking for - a durable, inexpensive, made-to-fit screen shield. Installation was straightforward thanks to the clear directions. The shield has been on my phone for 7 months now and still looks new. Fingerprints clean off easily and completely. Still no scratches. Does not dim or distort the display. I'm completely satisfied with this product."
Poory made.
Quick delivery. Fits and works very well
I love this charger. I went from 1% to 3% in less than 30 seconds. I would definitely recommend.
all right
great case but nothing to keep it closed
"I'm very happy with the product. I'm no fool, I put a piece of toilet tissue in the bag and sealed it, and put a brick on top of it under 3 feet of water for two days. The tissue was bone dry. I then went jetskiing with my iPhone."
"Sometimes the charging can be a bit tricky, I have plugged it in with the correct amperage and left it charge overnight and it was still not charged. this has happened a few times now, but every time I charge my phone with it, it works great and the flashlight isn't too bright but its just a power bank, I didn't buy it expecting it too be super bright. its a nice little bonus thrown in, its also nice to be able to check the battery status of your power bank."
"This case is exactly as shown in photos. Made well,  fit is perfect and incredibly well priced. I put a tempered glass screen protector on my Note 5 and with this case there is no need whatsoever to buy an otter box at 5 times the cost."
Great Product
Received quickly and grand kids love them!
Came super early not the exact color but it's cute
"It did not fit my phone, and also looked cheap."
Works great on my Countertop hot water dispenser which I hadn't used for a couple of years.  Somehow I misplaced the old cord during my recent move.
It's good!
All ready broken from taking my phone out to charge.  It's not built to take it in and out from the plastic it should've been rubber to stand the activities.
I did a bit of research before purchasing this for my iPhone 6. Have used it for close to six months now and it is one of my favorite cell phone cases ever. It's relatively slim on the phone and provides it with a surprisingly large amount of protection. I also especially like how it is mostly transparent so you still can enjoy the cool looks of the iPhone. Easy to install or take off the phone too. No issues accessing any of the buttons or the charging port at all.
Great quality
very good
Great product
The quality of the items are wonderful! I received items within a week and 2 days.
Does not fit the screen fully really disappointed
"Activated the phone with AT&T and it works great. I receive high signal strength almost everywhere I go at work and home. Not a top of the line phone but for the price and everything it comes with, very well worth it."
"I wish it were just a bit wider to cover more, but it shipped quickly,  and is staying on even though my phone goes in and out of my pocket and purse multiple times a day."
These batteries literally saved my phone from ever dying and now I take them both everywhere I go
"I received this unit two days ago. Received it as scheduled. I went ahead and installed the unit. Installation was real quick, as everything is explained in the operation manual.<br />I did all tastes as required. Tuner was okay, playing music via cd was awesome, as well as playing music via USB.<br />I have a Sony xperia z2, so configuring my phone to this head unit via NFC was wonderful. I did make a series of phone calls, and everything went on smoothly.<br />Men, I was very happy. I love Sony."
protects the phone but with no screen cover it will get scratched.
love it
Good to have website to show you how to put on
great one i like it
thank wonderful product
This is an amazing charger it charges my device quickly but the wall adapter offen get really hot at times
good product
GOOD STUFF
Product is as described.
worked great and had everything I needed

Fit perfect. Works great.
"These headphones sounds great and don't fall out while at the gym. I have to use the medium size rubber inserts while my girlfriend used the smallest size. (The biggest size were too big.) My girlfriend loves the color. They are study since they are constructed mostly out of metal. The headphones themselves are on the larger side, they stick out of your ear a little. I suppose if you had very small ears it might look a bit weird, other than that I really like them.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review."
Pay the extra dollar for the slightly better one from someone else. This one is garbage.
Thanks
Case does not particularly fit snugly. Cutout for the camera misaligned. (This may be the cause of it not fitting properly.). Pretty cheap. Not worth $10.
This is a nice case and it looks nice in my phone. Thank You for another nice case!
"Love the phone,  was every thing I heard. I would suggest you buy one. For the money, it will be hard to find better deal. One of best sounding I ever had."
Fit my phone perfectly
At first I couldn't get it to fit my phone but it turned out alright in the end.
"I have an iPhone 6 Plus - I love this mount. It's VERY solid. Seems to stick well (tho I have not had it through a summer in Georgia yet) - I have it mounted in a Toyota 4-Runner on a plastic vertical surface. Extremely adjustable. Hardly shakes at all during movement (they're all going to shake some). I do not have a case on my phone - it grips it well and without damaging the phone. Has soft rubber-ish contact parts. When I set the phone into the mount, it automatically grabs it and can be removed with one hand. I highly recommend this mount. (Oh, in case you're wondering, the &#34;foot&#34; it rests on slides right and left, so you can position it where you can still plug in your power or headphones). I'm actually thinking of buying one for my office desk."
"This is my second one, and I liked the first one so well I bought another one when I tried to run my first one through washing machine. Price was good but the sound made it worth even more than I paid."
The bag that was supposed to hold everything was broke when I received it not to mention one of the flowers was already broke as well.
Love this product.'
I have one and bought this for my husband works very well and is very clear works very well with Siri and iPhone 5c and iPhone 6.
It is really good and I recommend
I never write reviews but all anker products are the best!
"It is TINY and came all bent up in an envelope, so it's pretty much useless. You get what you pay for.... when will I learn that??"
The sticker is pelling off. The cover the back was right but the front of it was cama. Was not happy.
like it
just as advertised.
It is simple and easy to place it on my iPad Air 2
"Battery runs down pretty quickly when connected to wifi, charge twice daily. Takes great pics and has great features otherwise."
works great!
The Spigen stand is very stable and holds the watch in place firmly.
Sleek and stylish.
not too shabby. plus its lifetime warranty.
The cord is super long and it works great!<br />Exactly as expected.
good one
"Damn, why Cant they just be a little cheaper. I am very picky with my money, but I used these with the Comply Foam Ear Tips and I was blown away how great they sound. I don't even play with the ear hooks/wings/ whatever everyone wants to call them. I don't have too. with the Comply Foam tips, you get an incredible seal that blocks out the World around you and When using the right size, you can workout and run and jump and head bang knowing your headphones will not be falling out. I love the hardshell case in comparison to the cheap bags that everyone else provides, the bags protect from scratches and nothing more, the case that come with these, will protect your investment. They are as portable as you can get without purchasing the EARIN. Bottom line, all customers would appreciate a lower price on any and every item, but these are honestly worth the money as long as they are durable enough. only time will tell that tale."
Exact as it shows came in 2 days love the product
Defective product.  2 out of the 4 charging ports do not work.
Love the band  exactly like the apple sport band without the high price will purchase all colors received very quickly.
"I've used Spigen Slim Armor cases on my last couple of devices, and recommend them to everyone that asks about my case.  Great fit and finish, adn the kickstand is a nice touch.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a better case, and with Amazon's pricing, you can't go wrong."
Saves a lot of plug-in space on vacation!
I followed instructions on the internet (it took me two hours) and the battery broke the iphone.  I had to buy a new phone because of it:(
Nice phone for a reasonable price.
excellent! Thank you
Great case.. love the color.  Just wish it was a little thinner.
"Cute, functional and protects my phone well."
works perfect
I gave an extra star because the color is vibrant & looks amazing! But one drop on the (hardwood) floor & my screen cracked :-( what's the point of a case if it doesn't protect the screen? Disappointed.
Great product so far.  Its see through exactly how i wanted.  Helps to show off the phone.
This product does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well. I had previously lost a supposedly &#34;waterproof&#34; phone to water damage and wanted something that would offer more reliable protection as a 2nd line of defense. This product is really easy to use and as far as I can tell it is really waterproof under normal conditions like kayaking and swimming pools and whatnot. The lanyard can be helpful when you need your hands free or want to be extra sure you won't drop it. The clips that hold the case shut are easy enough to open but difficult enough that it can't readily open by accident. The plastic is clear enough that you can take decent pictures through it though it may fog up in cold water depending on the conditions.
Good slim case. It works exactly as I expected. Provides small amount of protection without adding any bulk. No problems so far.
It did not fit my iPhone 6.  Shipping cost too much to return it considering what it cost.  Now out of money and can't use it.
"I purchased the iPhone 6 sport armband in green it's a great color just like the pic.  These are stitched well, the neoprene is soft and strong, it's pretty comfortable. I haven't worked out with it but I can tell you it's perfect for playing with your kids at the playground, after you get used to it you forget you're wearing it.  My phone fit even with a slim bumper case on (youvogue); and the touchscreen, while not as sensitive, was still usable through the vinyl face on this and with the tempered glass screen protector.  The little key slot is too small for an automotive chip key but I didn't even notice that it had one in the description so I didn't buy it for that anyway. You could tuck some cash in there.  All in all its a great piece of gear and I will use it a lot.  Love the fun colors!<br /><br />I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Great quality, just what I needed!"
Great durable case!
Great product with amazing customer service.Will continue to buy  Anker products.
We bought 2 of the LGG3 Glass protectors for 2 phones. The first one we rec last week on Friday went on great. No issues. Stuck well and looks good.Ordered a second one for a new phone rec on Monday. This one had issue getting it to stick. Something was different. Followed same procedure even though new phone with cleaning etc. Something different. Would have given 5 stars except for the sticking issue with the second one.
So far so good.
I got this before a trip to Disneyland so that we could keep our phones charged durning the day. It has become one of my favorite accessories! It can charge my iPhone 6 several times before it needs recharged. I use it on the go and also just when here is not a outlet close by to plug into.
Perfect fit for iPad Mini 2. Good quality.
"WOW. I didn't realize an armband would actually fit my iPhone 6 plus. So I ordered this one to try it out. It is perfect. It fits my 13 inch arms (Hey, I'm a thick girl) great with a little room left over on the velcro band. The reflective strip around the screen is great. I love when companies think ahead on safety, as some armbands do not have that.<br />I am able to access the bottom port for my ear buds with no issue. The phone fits snug into the band, but I have to remove it from its case first. This is pretty much a given. However, my kid can use it with his iPhone 6 still in the case and it fits without any issue. The screen does not hinder the touch screen ability at all.<br />But I am unable to use the armband. I love my iPhone 6 plus, but it's too big for me to carry on my arm. It interferes with the ability to move my elbow because of the size. But, that's okay since again, my kid can use it with his  iphone 6.<br />I received a sample armband to test and use in exchange for my unbiased review."
Poor quality!!!!! Very difficult to use clip holder still have not been able to use. The case for the phone is durable. The stand is a good thing but it only sit horizontally. The stylus tip fell off after a few uses.
This is a great product. Would highly recommend . I have 4 of them. They are the best chargers .
"Worth the price, fit my phone perfectly. Just what I wanted."
Just what I wanted. Very prompt in sending it.
Has about a 6 inch range. Useless.
Good
"Great case, I accidentally ordered this one, but needed the 6 not the 6 plus. my exchange was quick and easy."
"Anker has never disappointed me. I love it. It works well, but it is fairly big and does weigh a bit more than I expected. It's a bit heavy, but it can restore my devices super fast. Worth the money!<br />If I have enough money, I'll buy your amazing new product &#34;Anker PowerCore+&#34;"
"Bought for my son after he saw I had another vendors model, he wanted to take it and I needed it for work when have long days on a call with support. This model charges his phone 4 times with juice left over, although he charges as soon as 1 bar is missing if around power.<br />Owned a couple months, so far it has held up, will update if fails prematurely, expect 3-5 years of use."
"This LCD protector looks very cool on my phone, i will recommend it if you want your phone's face to look like a mirror"
Works great
"The unit worked for the first 30 days or so; however, the device over heats very quickly and burnt out to expensive 64gig micro-SD cards.<br />The unit would freeze often and stops recording. The picture is great when the camera is actually working but it is unreliable and defective."
"I was expecting the case to be all black with floral print and it ended up being navy and black and warped, so it doesn't even fit my phone right."
"I had a garmin 305 and liked  that until i took it swimming. I ordered the 310xt and had to send the first one back as there was a problem with the battery. This one seems to work fine, I think Garmin products are the only way to go, I have a garmin nuvi for my car and a rhino 530 for the woods"
Fast and good quality
"Worked perfectly, was delivered in a timely manner and the extra tools were appreciated."
"I had no problems with this cable.  It did what I expect it too, charged my Kindle in a timely fashion.  I do love the length. It allows me to not be so close to the wall when using why charging.  Glad for the freedom."
It's terrible! My mute button didn't work even if I took the rubber ban off. The lock button don't work. IT WAS BROKE WHEN I RECIEVED IT!!! Don't waste your time or money on it....
Fantastic!
I like it
"It fits perfectly on my Note 4, and it's  easy to slip on and take off. It feels sturdy and durable. Very satisfied."
Is good but does not last long..
I have an otter box and this case fits very tight.
Worked perfectly for our backpacking trip. I live in southern AZ so I have not tried it in part sun.
No more blue tooth for us!  This is better for your health and works great!
"these are useful for small projects, the connectors work fine and i don't have any issues with the construction of them. good value, you get exactly what you expect from this product."
You get what you pay for.
Works as intended.  The slot through the middle is a nice touch for keeping a power cord attached.  We use it for a 10&#34; tablet in the family room.
"We've been using the Jackery Giant+ for almost 12 months now and we love it. We've used it everyday to charge phones, tablets, run our GoPro cameras at night for extended time lapse settings and so many more uses.  We recently reviewed the new Titan model which boasts an 18,000 mAh battery capacity while providing 2.4A of solid power to two devices at the same time thanks to the dual USB ports.  Charging the Titan only takes 11 hours for a full charge while offering 390 hours of continuous use.  The portable battery weighs in at almost 1lb. and you can note it's premium quality and build upon picking the unit up for the first time.  Jackery is the #1 premium brand on Amazon and they've earned my business. Any future portable charging needs and I'll be selecting Jackery again in the future. Full review here: http://youtu.be/5whV-ky4dPo"
Great product. Easy to order.
"Received the free samples,we are so pleased with this waterproof phone pouch/case.It can work for iphone6 plus and fits perfect, we are out on a boat, that will go fast and bounce and things can fall off even if you are taking care. So we trusted this pouch to protect the phone if it was to have a fall over into the water. No one wants to think there phone will fall in water or get dirt all over it. So it is best to be prepared, It can also hold a credit card or some cash too, It has a strap that you could tie to something or hook on your wrist as well. It is easy to put the phone in and out is just slides in or out, and there is two locking tabs on the top that seals it.<br />I received a free or discounted product for a honest and unbiased review. All statements are true.I received this product for free on exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Glad I got two of them, ask wife to put on phone,  I think she did not clean screen in one corner, so I took the other one to store I shop at  for them to put on. Saved money they put on for Free. Also no scratches yet!  the plastic ones scratch too easy."
as  advertised
its great. But its hard to get off the phone  ;D
"Lightweight, but super protective. Love it 💫💫💫"
My father loved this case. Still uses it today. It's slim and easy to handle. Not hard to remove and replace.
"This product advertises the free spring tool, which is one of the deciding factors to purchase this item rather than others similar. The tool was not included, very disappointed! The item itself is working just fine, but it was a pain to put on without the tool."
works well and protects my phone! very happy.
"The edges don't lie flat on the phone. The screen immediately got dust under all the edges. Didn't last more than maybe a few months. They should just make it smaller, so it lies flat. I bought a new one by a different company, and it lies flat."
Great product! But I lost the remote and would like to purchase separately. Can I do that?
Fits as said. Places perfectly on the edge's edges
"It arrived on time, and everything was just as described. Great price for a great product. VERY happy with this purchase.<br />Thanks so much! (:"
Not too thick like you would expect! Easy to carry around the cable and the case is super protective. I received a discount on my order for a fair review.
Great!
"Easiest screen protector I have ever installed. No bubbles from the start.<br /><br />Update:<br />After less than one week, protector is chipping and has cracks from bottom corner in to the button. Never seen this before."
This is a super thin case with lots of fun color choices!  Won't make your phone bulky and I've had it bounce off the parking lot more than once with no damage.
great
"Good for the price, decent sound. They are on my fishing boat.."
Great product
Everything I had expected and more.<br />So glad I ordered it.
I had used this once. I plugged it in to use it a second time and i immediately smelled burning and saw smoke. The end that plugs into the phone was smoking and burning. Smoke immediately filled my car. Had I not been in my driveway this could have been very dangerous. And I've now tried the charger base with other cords and it wont work with any other cord. Needless to say I would never buy another one!!!!
"Really good fit on the phone, but sometimes the rubber doesn't grab the plastic edge. Otherwise excellent and good prtection for the device."
Best screen protector I've ever had. It has a slightly Matte finish  and the directions make it go on so easily. The cutouts are perfect in it doesn't leave smudges like other protectors leave. you won't go wrong with this protector
speaker is tinny
Boooooo...
"This product is complete trash. I ordered this months ago and it still is not at my house and on my apple watch. I contacted the seller and I get all these BS excuses like &#34;oh to get you the best product we are going to take weeks on end to ship this to you&#34; this seller is Untrustworthy and incapable of making proper sales DO NOT BUY, there are better ones out there who's seller is capable of satisfying a consumer. Trust me SELLER IS GARBAGE AND PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!"
nice
Love it! It even came with a stylus  which was  a nice surprise
I have used his case since prime day and it has held up amazingly. I have dropped my phone and it has been well protected and the case looks as good as new. I love always having my ID and CC close. Only thing that would make it better is if it was easier to open and close the case. It gets stuck closed and makes it difficult to open at times- often when there is a line behind me. If there was a button or latch that would make it more user friendly.
I put it on and haven't regretted it.  It does make the watch larger and beefier looking.  The only thing I didn't like was that the screen protector leaves a small gap of 2-3mm between the screen protector and the outer ring of protection.  No problems installing it
"My friend love it, wish would got a different color than black.... too much with the deliver charge tho..."
"Product came when it was supposed to, which to me is very important.  It seems to be working well.  I've had it 4 months and it stopped working for some reason.  The return policy ran out.  Buying something else.  Enough of Anker!"
Just like the Apple OEM EarPods without the Apple Store price.
excellent product
"Cute case, make sure you get a screen cover for the front of the phone. I like the stand but don't like that it can only stand one way. Makes it easier to watch videos on my phone without holding it"
Wrong case size. Not for iPhone 5s.
Fits great
Horrible product. Fits so loosely in the power slot that it would fall down immediately. Got stolen out of my car and I didn't really care. Would never buy again.
We tried other kind with bigger tip. We like this better (My husband and I).
Bleu tooth microphone is very noisy wile driving person calling find it hard to hear me
This is cheap and the quality is the same as that of an Apple product.
Cover fit well and I was able to use the phone without a problem.
I like it use it all the time.
Complete crap. The thing doesnt even fit in the cigarette lighter in my car.
It work thanks
Great!
"I was looking for something that would charge quickly as I use my iPad all day now. I needed something that worked with Apple certified devices. This fit the bill. I have been using it since yesterday, and it works like a champ!!  The rapid charge on top I use for the iPad, the second one for my iPhone, and the third one I charged your external battery in that I will keep in my purse. Absolutely perfect!!"
As soon as they start getting hot outside good thing would fall off my dashboard
Very good selelr.
Really cool and handy but why have a wireless charger that is connected to a cord. I think the charger should have a built in battery so you can charge the charger and take it wherever
"I get this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I am so excited to own this selfie stick since I don't have one and I get jealous on my friends. I have an iPhone 6 plus,I am so impressed  It holds my phone securely  as I take a picture of myself. The nice thing about this selfie stick is that comes up with a very nice packaging and you can tell already that this is a premium and quality made selfie stick. It is foldable and has a very sleek design unlike to the other selfie sticks I saw. It has a pouch for you to keep the stick in your purse! Loved the fact that it is easy to use.Unlike to other ones, this one is very unique! This is not Bluetooth device, All you have to do to is to plug the cord into the audio hole of your phone and Press the camera sign in the handle area of the stick and bam! Selfie   I would definitely recommend this product to everybody who loves taking selfies of themselves!"
"Recieved in turn for an honest reveiw.<br />The case is very sturdy, and all the ports and buttons align and work very well.<br />I love the fact that the covers for the charger port, aux port and the silence button on the side fit very nicely and do not come loose.<br /><br />Only thing that I notice which is not to big of a deal for me is the screen protector that is attached to the case.<br />My screen protector shows like an oily pattern when the screen is off.<br />Slightly visible when screen is on low brightness."
"The screen protector seems alright. Mine didn't quite fit right, and because of that, when I put my protective case on, the screen protector's edges got messed up and now it looks kind of ugly."
As good or as bad as the original Otter.<br />They tend to brake in the belt clip and the hlster clip after a while.
Great for 6+..  Bought for song for his phone and he works outside a lot.
"Very easy to swap after watching a quick youtube video. Definitely worth it. My old port cover had broken long ago, and I didn't realize a replacement could be done so easily without taking it to a store. Probably took about 5 minutes total, including watching the video and messing with a screw that didn't want to budge."
Bought several cases at once and really liked this at of all. It is not bulky at all and I've dropped my phone about 10 Xs already and it is fine though it always scares me because it isn't a bulky protector type case but it has worked like one so far. Hopefully I don't drop now and it breaks since I have a great review. 😉
This screen protector is very well made and fits well on my phone. It was simple to apply thanks to the instructions on the box. I have a small bubble but it's barely seen and I'm pretty sure it's due to my error. Overall I'm very pleasedisappointed with this product and am thankful to have something to protect my screen.
I've used this mount while traveling a number of times now and it has been very useful.  No problem attaching to air vents in car and holds strong.
Really great case my last one was making my phone over heat and this is exactly what i needed and it fits perfect ive had multiple compliments..
"Yes. It met my expectations.  I love it, and I like your services.  Your company is good for whatever services you offer to the general public."
It was great to have a long plug in but it broke right near the iPad plug in after a couple weeks.
Did not fit snugly onto phone.
"Great size, easy access,"
Stopped working on day 45. Amazon says its ineligible for return. Pretty disappointed!
"Works great! I put it on my night stand for convenience.. let the phone sit on it over night, wake up to a fully charged phone.<br /><br />Works as it should."
Works good some voice distortions with a low voice
Not bad for $10.has good rubber cushion on edges and doesn't interfere with screen.im satisfied
"After using it for a month, 2 of the 6 ports no longer charges. Without me contacting them, AnkerDirect customer support saw my review and wrote to me directly and advises me on how to reset the unit and resolve the problem. It turns out that the port isn't working properly because my device might has triggered the protective internal safety switch. In order to reset the switch, unplug all cables (including power cable) for five minutes and retry. the 2 &#34;bad&#34; ports work fine after that. I gave them a five star because Anker care about their reputation and the product has this build in protection and it works fine."
"&#34;This a great looking and highly functional case for the iPhone 6.It is a nice solid construction and doesn't add too much bulk to the phone.The case is a little stiff and not that easy to separate.You need to follow the instruction carefully.You should  remove screen protectors at first.<br />You are advised to test the case for waterproofness by placing a piece of paper in the case then dunking it in water. This I did with no problems, the paper was bone dry All the ports are sealed with stoppers so it should be completely sealed.<br />The buttons were still easy to press with the case on and the fingerprint sensor works perfectly;<br />All in all, I like this case and recommend it. &#34;"
This little stand is great! It holds my iPad and iPhone with ease. I highly recommend this product.
Good!!
A great deal for the price.  Same quality as the single stylus at the same price.
I am extremely pleased with the product!
"Great headphones, so easy to use"
Nice soft gel and fit perfectly.
Hopefully I won't have to find out if it works!
Worked perfect for 5c through AT&T.  No issues.
"Great product. Wall/car charger, cable and pouch.  Looks slick but you have to remove the cover if your going to use the wall charger and that can get lost."
Fell apart after a couple of days. But worked well while it lasted.
Perfect for the upgrade.
"For what it is, it's great. Moved kid from a flip phone to this and he is happy. Works as expected."
I am very disappointed.  worst experience ever.
"Looks great, can barely tell the film is there.  Haven't dropped my phone yet so unsure of the protective qualities."
So cute!!! Could not believe how quick I received it!!
"I bought this for my wife she love it,  its really beautiful and the rocks are good quality"
Works very well. Gets hot when In use though.
Excellent protection for my Droid Maxx. Slips in and out of my pocket easily.
"This tracker works great for both my step count and sleep. I have a toddler who never sleeps through the night and it usually gets a record of when I'm up with him.  Sometimes it records my wakings as light sleep rather than awake, but I'm satisfied.  I accidentally sent it on a wash cycle and it survived in perfect working order.  Washing machine is about 200 steps!  Really impressed that this is working out just as well as the $100+ devices."
I love this case. The kick stand is great and like the slim profile.
Love the case.  It fits perfect to my iPhone. Their customer service is great and super fast to respond any questions and inquiries.  I actually ordered the 6 instead of the 6 plus and they did not hesitate in helping me out!
"They fit fine on RCA female jacks. However, they are hard to remove if you change your mind; I wished they had a knob attached so you could pull them off with ease, like with some Firewire and e-Sata connector covers.  Still they do the job."
I really love this flip case - so easy to use and remove.  Safety and secure.  All in one slim case.
"Just got it and installed today for my 2009 Toyota Tacoma and it was very easy to install, works very good. Well recommend it  Worth the money.<br />Fast delivery.  Sam"
"Gave this to my wife to use in her car and she's very happy with it. Great that it has the double outlets and like the light indicating when it's got power (not all cars work when turned off, so it reminds us when it's not working).<br />Happy with build quality and no problems with it."
The best!
"Fits my Samsung 5 perfectly, and is roomy."
"Beautiful  color, great value, and came before expected"
On average products.
The best screen savers for my Samsung S II Phone for the price and that I have been able to find yet! 😀
we love it
Works well. Doesn't get too hot.
works perfect
"Was too big, didn't fit the phone right."
Protect your iPhone at all costs! Lol!! It makes the phone seem a bit bulky but worth getting. Matches the color of phone exactly.
Its great
Excellent product. .charge fast
"I was so excited to get this product.  I had just recently purchased an iPhone 5s and was looking for something to carry it in.  When I got this case, I immediately put my phone in it and it fit great.  My phone is nice and snug which is one thing I was concerned about - but not anymore!  The reason I rated this a 4 and not a 5 is because I can tell the case is not great quality.  I think it will do the trick for a few months, but I don't expect it to last longer than that.  But for the price, I can buy another one to replace it!<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"For under $10 you really can't go wrong. The Note 5 is just to slippery to use without a case, and having had Cruzerlite cases for almost every phone I've had I purchased another one. It fits the Note 5 very well, and does not block any of the ports. Also, it allows wireless charging with my Tylt charger. Great case, no complaints."
"Been a big fan of all Anker products and this one is great as well.  Just be careful if a blinding blue LED light bothers you. Customer service is top notch, will continue to buy anker."
"This is a good product at a great price! Four stars were given to this product by me for:<br />-It needs a longer low battery warning than just 2 min<br />-It cuts out every once in a while but doesn't bother me at all. Not even a 10th of a millisecond and continues the song, so not a big deal.<br />I am a very observant person so if it doesn't bother me than it most likely won't bother you if your aren't as observant. Other than those 2 things, this is a great product. I used the headset for talking on the phone once and the other individual on the other line could hear me great. Hope this review helps with your purchase, thanks!"
Working great!  Fairly easy to install.  Happy to have my camera back on my phone!
Worx.
Not what i wanted
Excellent cable by Apple. Fits iPhone 5 or beyond
Fancy and pretty. Fits perfectly on the cell. Exactly what I wanted.
Loveing my case
Its a really pretty case! The picture does not do it justice.
"This is by far the best selfie stick I've come across.  It's very well constructed and easy to use.  I had just one failure.  The small coil spring that clamps the phone keeper slipped off its perch.  I haven't been able to retrieve it.  However, I found that rubber band is a easy fix."
"Really nice case, sturdy and functional"
"I have been privelaged enough to actually sample quite a few products from Joto and all of their products are great quality and nicely priced. I did receive this G4 phone case at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. This case is for the LG G4, the case itself is clear so you can actually show off your brand new phone. A lot of people don't like that most cases actually hide your phone and people do care or they wouldn't make phone color options like white, black, silver etc...So this allows you to display your phone while adding that much needed protection that all phones need. Snaps on nice and easy, no modifications whatsoever are needed. All functions of the phone are uninterrupted, so all in all this is a 5 star case in my opinion.<br /><br />I did receive this phone case at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review!"
Didn't work good and got only $10 off
Love it
as described.
I love this case. It's secure and provides protection.. I dropped my phone plenty times and with this case it didn't crack or anything 😅
We ordered these to use in our Boys & Girls Club.  We rent space in a large building and our rooms are spread out.  Parents come to the front desk and the front desk staff calls over the radio for the child(ren) being picked up.  2 out of 3 of these walkies stopped working within 2  month of buying them.  The warranty that I bought doesn't cover it because we use it in a work setting.  I ordered 3 more in July and 1 out of 3 of those isn't working.  Kids do not handle the walkies.  They sit on a desk by a staff.  I am VERY disappointed in the quality of these walkies for the HIGH price
I love the credit card holder! The color wasn't my favorite but I love how well it works as a wallet and phone case.
Always nice to have extra USB chargers in the truck!  How can you go wrong?
Excellent case same as the picture 😌
"Works as described!  I applied this to the dashboard of a Prius 2013 and it sticks very well.  In addition, I have not had any issues with it coming off during the hot weather.  It stays in place.<br />Overall it works well."
"should have read it other reviews before buying. It keeps falling off and finally I lost one. Now I cannot return it as well.<br />Other than that, it was OK. It is not hard plastic, it is soft rubber band and somewhat protects the watch from minor bumps. I had black one and it wasn't looking bad on watch although it hides the shining side surface of the watch."
EXCELENTE
Great case. Kickstand works well
Works great and easy to use.
I have about a 75% success rate in opening bottles. the cigarette lighter kind of worked once but I haven't been able to recharge it. its a little bulky but I do like how it looks.
Very  good.
love it
Love my new phone case. Beautiful
Good product but does not fit Sprint phone's buttons. Verizon only.
"Boyfriend loves it, I bought a more expensive one just in case and he chose this one."
Nice cover and it can hold a couple credit cards. I have received several compliments on this cover.
My daughter love it!
Phone works great! My charger that it came with did not. But the phone works perfectly :)
very versatile loved it and cheap
"I would've rated this product 5 stars, because it looked great, fit well, and was pretty good quality. However, three weeks have gone by and the color has completely worn off on the outer bumper. It looks terrible. For this reason I am giving this case 1 star. This is a picture of the sea foam green case."
Great Product!
"My kids think this is magic.<br /><br />I have been using my Moto X 2014 and had a good experience so far with our first selfie stick. When my sample arrived to review, I was a bit skeptical but it works well and holds the phone firmly in place. Given I am not a pack horse, even though I am a mom with a purse, I really needed something light and compact and this fits the bill and most of my bags. Our selfie stick has held up well, even being handled less than gingerly at times by two little boys."
"Very happy with the product, and the additional small free gifts / accessories included.<br /><br />Was delighted when the protective case arrived a full two weeks before the estimated time of delivery"
As advertised.
Excellent...
The case was exactly as described. It fits perfectly and the screen protector is as good as any other. This was definitely a good buy!
Like it jus don't like the closure on the bag.
was fine and fit perfectly. was what we were looking for
Excellent product. Good quality sound I love it. Easy to connect.
Works great!
"I followed the &#34;hinge application&#34; advice and everything went smoothly until it was time to peel off the top layer.  When I did, the real protection layer came off with the top layer. Needless to say, this first failed attempt is a good lesson."
Good quality charger fits snug to the phone. Only down side was that it was a little short. Does the job perfect.
Amazing amount of items at a great price.
Everything you want in a case. Especially for a phone this size!
"I would have given 5 stars the beginning, however now I can not use them. Whether I am on the phone or listening to music, all I hear are muffled sounds. I had to order a different brand. Plus these don't stay in your ear all that well"
EXCELENTE
I just love the new new case . I would highly recommend it. The color is beautiful! Very sturdy but still streamlined.
"Amazing, does what it is supposed to do; protect your phone from water"
Great product!!!
Very cute ! love it
It is what I expected. Not the best feel to the plastic
"Not completely happy with the merchandise. The size is suppose to be for my phone, but it's off on the side and bottom. I need to change the one that I put on my phone because of the film build up and I just purchased them.."
Works fine for charging my LG Tracfone in the car. You can't beat this price and speedy delivery.
"The phone was sent to Trinidad in the Caribbean  and it's working great...my sister loves it, says it so much simpler to use..now my other sister wants one..."
Does what it says it will.
"Solid product if you're looking for a selfie stick. Solid build quality, highly recommended."
"Absolutely what I was looking for and its length is exactly what I wanted, superb quality"
Great
Love this case
Worked for one day then can't pair it anymore. Followed all the &#34;tips&#34; no help. Trying to find contact info is impossible...
Love the case for its design and durability.
Doesn't work 2nd one I've gotten. Won't charge my phone. Disappointed.sending it back.
It's cute and does what it need to do
Works great.
very easy hook up.  Nice to be able to use it with my camera on my ipod
Worked like a champ!
Side button on both sides are very hard to push I also have one for a iPhone 6 plus that is the same way I've been using it for about a month and I'm not too happy with this product. Color options were good but that's it
These headphones are uncomfortable in my ear the right one actually hurts  like hard plastic. They fall out of my ears frequently. Bluetooth connection occassionally cuts in and out but my biggest complaint is the battery life. It runs out of juice after just over two hours. I cant get thru two 75 minute workouts before the battery dies.
It broke within 2 weeks of use.  Wishing now I had purchased a lifeproof case.
"Item arrived EXTREMELY past due, it does not come out of the case properly, the screen protector is VERY CHEAPLY made & doesn't cover the screen properly, and the case itself- is only good if it is dropped. I would NOT recommend this product to others."
"I can complete my phone's battery at least twice, and still left to charge more. Excellent."
Really like it
Works well
"Great product, excellent  protection for my new phone."
Works as it should. Worth the money.
"The charger works good with a 2 amp power adapter, but the suction cup design is useless in a car.<br />The phone slides off with any movement at all. You can't drive with a phone in place. (Galaxy S6)<br />I made a small aluminum tab and glued it on the bottom edge to hold the phone in place, but any bumps still cause it to fall off."
"Practical, for keeping my phone safe with a beautiful print. Love it."
Daughter loves this.
Worked as described.  Holds charge all day.
"fake product, i received broken item,<br />please don't buy it under any cost"
Does not stick well. One corner already curling up.
Lifeproof has always been an upstanding brand. I bought this for my Galaxy S4 and wasn't disappointed at all. I did have to contact Lifeproof due to the hinged charging port protector on the bottom breaking off. Their customer service was excellent with helping me and telling me what I need to send them to get my product replaced. I sent them the information they required and they shipped me a brand new case! I've had no issues at all with the new case or the hinged charging port protector. I would definitely purchase another Lifeproof case if I need one simply because they stand behind their product and take care of their customers.
Great product small easy to use and fits in your pocket 👍
I love this holding up very well.  Worth every penny.
This wristlet is super useful if you're going out with just a phone and your id/credit cards because it's super tiny and you can literally fit it in a pocket or just have it around your wrist.
works perfect
Works great for charging my I POD.
Great cover! It works and looks perfectly on my iphone 6.
"Although the color of the tassel doesn't appear as dark/vibrant as the pictures, they look great! The case is thin so it doesn't further expand the size of my already-big-enough iphone 6. Worth buying! :)"
Great product
Liked it
A good job
Like it.
"Excelent product it charges very fast! Looks great,  charges two devices at the same time"
Best case ever!
I love it ! It is a pretty nice case comes with all little functions such as opening /closing with magnet attached and pockets to hold your business cards or credit cards . Also It has a small window so your iPhone logo could display from the back...
Not working at all .
The phone case is great and it got here fast.
A great cell phone for the price. It has all that I need in a cell phone.
"Just received today, and I am really impressed. This piece of equipment is a real good headset for me."
"i love love love this case, it's so cute and girlie as i expected it to be and it came on time, definitely will do more business!!!"
"Lovin it thus far. I got this to keep in my pocket along with a small portable power pack and love them both. Before I would run out of juice before making it to my car but now I'm good. Because it's in my pocket all the time I wonder how long it will last before the little cable is wore out but if I get 6 months out of it I will be happy. If I don't, I'll be sure to revisit this review."
"I use it with my Microsoft surface 3 to watch movies on long plane trips. I start with the unit plugged into the surface, runs movies with volume up for over 18 hours. YES OVER 18 HOURS. What can I say other than I love it. I don't write reviews, but just had to share my joy with this product."
The BUDDIBOX case is sturdy and not bulky like the Otterbox.  Easy to add case to the phone for a snug fit.  Using the phone with case is comfortable and the buttons are raised offering much comfort. Accessing the charging ports and headphone jack is easy with the openings on the BUDDIBOX. The red color is bright enough to see when you lose your phone in your purse or on a messy desk.  I would recommend and/or purchase for a friend or myself again.
Bought for my husband and he loves this phone cover.
"I love Caseology cases. This is my second case from them, and I couldn't be happier. My only concern happened on my first case: the brand name wore off after being taken out and put in my pocket so many times. Besides that, I love it! Would recommend to anyone looking for a plain case."
Excellent product. It never gets warm ko matter the gadget you connect. Ihace charged 2 samsung 1 ipad and a extra battery and did it in a good time.
"Easy to put on, but flimsy.  Even though I thoroughly cleaned the screen several times - once with the spray and each time with the cloth, there were dust particles left by the cloth which could not be removed from the film.  Once I got the film on, it was grainy and made my screen look fuzzy.  I had to take it off completely as I could not see through the dust and fabric leftovers."
"It has quick charging for all those power users with compatible phones but it started to smell like if it was burning, it got extremely hot and almost burned my hand when i unplugged it."
Great products great prices
Good product.
Perfect.
Excellent
"I recommend this product, it is effective and reasonably priced.  I submerged it in water with a paper towel inside and it came out dry after 30 minutes.  I even added some weight to it to make sure it was submerged.<br /><br />It is totally worth the money I paid and it is a much better deal and effective than the LifeProof case I had, which wasvery expensive and fell apart after six months and even the replacement case I received fell apart after 4 months also, so I gave up on it and bought the Accmor Waterproof case instead and I am very glad.<br /><br />I was not paid for this review, I don't know anyone associated with this product and I paid full price for the product.  The product was not given to me for free nor did I receive anything in exchange for my review but they truly deserve my recommendation."
EXCELLENT SERVICE GREAT
It works as expected.  Fast charging for my Notes 4 cellphone.
these saved my day and product after i made the purchase - fast shipping and great quality
bulky and unfashionable but the best call quality on the market.
Great for my purpose.  I have a Harley Road Glide.  I don't need a very long cable to plug it into my motorcycle so it works perfectly!  I wouldn't hesitate buying this if you are in the market for a short lightning cable.
item arrived quicker than expected and works great.
It works
"Charger is working nicely in the two Galaxy S6 we got, Charger has a blue light on during charging and display a green one when it is done, nice way to know that your phone is fully charged."
Broke after having it for 2 days
Problems!!!
It great
"Fits perfect, good grade of rubber, clean look."
"This is the best case for a phone I've ever seen.  Sleek, sexy, feels good...and affordable!  Fits my phone perfectly!"
"It was arrived fast, but my only concern was the size of them... the corners did not stick properly, so I had to even cut them slightly to fit my screen. Still corners are not stick, maybe I have different tablet I do not know."
Didn't work at all for intended purpose.
Got to me very quickly and was exactly what I needed.
These work great and are super cheap.
It is not as slick as it looks but it s useful
Da best
That last star could be had if only there was an opening that allowed the light sensor to adjust the brightness automatically. It's the only flaw I see. The elastic band is wide and fits my arm well. I have 19&#34; biceps and I don't have to adjust it open very much. On the smallest setting it fits around a medium sized water bottle and doesn't fall off. (For my arm exercises that make an arm band impractical). Overall it's a winner.
Awful phone. Over priced
This charger didn't charge my phone HTC M8.
Best case I've ever seen/used... Protects in many ways and is super fancy. Love that you can see the brand on the back. Feels nice in your hand and is still streamlined enough to fit in the usual purse spot. would definitely recommend
good
Great case period
Very protective and cute!
Excellent
Nice look but has a short when I move
A year later and it's still going strong!
As expected good price.  Quick delivery!
The phone case was for the model but way to small for the phone.
Had it for 4 months and it is now broken. Has not been misused. Shoddy product. Not worth any money
very good!
Love love love. I get compliments on this wherever I go.
"I love this case! It is super cute. I love that its clear plastic so that my white back can show through. I've gotten quite a few compliments on my phone since I've had the case. The bling is just the right amount. Its not crazy covered, but it gives that little accent. I think the thing I like most about it actually is how thin it is. I don't like when my phone is super heavy and thick after I put on a case. This adds almost no thickness to my phone. Please note that this case is mainly for decoration purposes, and serves almost no protection at all because it is all clear plastic all around and there is no rubber bumper anywhere to absorb shock if dropped or hit against anything. This is also just the back cover, and has nothing for the front screen. It is however a PERFECT fit. All the cut outs are exactly where they should be and everything lines up perfectly. I am usually very careful with my phone so I'm not worried about the protection. I just wanted something cute. Its very inexpensive, and I love it!<br /><br />(*I received this item in exchange for my honest review and opinion)"
Works fantastic! So convenient!
nice product
Really liked this screen protector untill I dropped the phone.  From a height of 2ft the screen protector broke at the top.  Kind of disappointing and concerning.
Excellent Thank You..
Perfect...it fits snug around my phone and does a great job protecting it...the little kickstand is an added bonus.  Worth the money...would purchase it again.<br />Thanks!
Works great in our 15 passenger to get the DVD players to work in the back of the van!
"The first unit received may have been defective so Anker's customer service replaced immediately with no hassle and it got a brand new one.  This second unit seems to be working fine.  I'm still not completely satisfied with the charging speed but, that's just my expectation and there's nothing wrong with the unit."
It doesn't fit well!
Good to have a longer one.  Works every time
This one seemed like it might be the perfect &#34;fit&#34; for me.
"Beautiful, durable, protective"
Keeps it from sliding.
Awesome item definitely comes in handy.
charge dont last
Great product
Love these. Take great pics without lugging a camera!
"2nd charger I bought from this company and it continues to overheat. I have used it on 4 different products and it gets very hot. Samsung S4, IPhone 5, IPhone 4, and my Note 4 and hot to the touch. Always!"
It's great !
"I really like this case. It came earlier than expected. Nice quality, I like the feel of it and how it looks on my phone."
Phone doesn't have a flash plus the memory on the phone gets full fast to the point where you can't download anymore apps
Perfect choice for my desk at the office
"I have tested this unit for a month or so and it has out preformed every dash-cam system I've tested to date. This system requires a micro USB card to operate (record and still shots), which was no big deal for me, as I had an extra. You will need to download an proprietary app to run this camera system. Using this app you set up the camera. I started my test indoors with plugging the unit into a USB power brick. If you don't put the micro USB card in as soon as you power it up it will beep continually until you do. The first major hurdle to setting the camera is to connect to the camera's wifi server. It took about 5 attempts before successfully connecting the phone to the camera.  As soon as the connection is made you can the easily navigate the app and see live streaming of the camera's view. You can then pare up the small remote button that comes with this camera. The button allows you to activate still shots or record. This remote is key to operation as it allows for quick operation of the camera. Once your camera is up and running you can see the awesome quality of the video stream. It is an adjustable stream, so you can dial it into a perfectly clear faster stream rate. I used this camera in just about every setting, I went with 1080p as that offered the clearest field of view.  I took it outside and mounted it in my Lincoln SVU. It wouldn't suction behind the mirror as it has those small black dots made into the windshield, so I had to lower mine, so it is in your field of view while driving.  You should know your states laws about driving with something stuck in the field of view because this may get you a ticket if it is considered an obstruction.  Once I got it to suction on to the windshield, I then made a connection to the power port in the SUV.  I left my cord dangling as I determined that you need to unplug it after use, my unit didn't disconnect from the power like it should have, not a big deal, but something to note. I think is more related to the fact that my power ports don't shut off when the vehicle is turned off.  If you car or truck shuts down the ports you should have no issue with mounting this as a permanent fixture. The first time is operated this camera I had my wife drive as I operated the camera using the app. You can watch the live feed and take still shot from the cell phone app too. Once you are outside the camera's wifi reception area you can only review previous clips and still shots taken. Once you reconnect to the camera's wifi you can then view what was recorded when you are away from the vehicle. The camera has a green and blue light on the back side facing you that stay on while in use, on of them is a constant light, the other blinks. This may bother some people especially for night time driving, but it didn't affect me. The suction cup has stayed in place even in extreme heat, as of yet no cold weather testing has been available. I will update to let you know if weather changes effect the ability to stay on the windshield.  This is an easy to use and operate system that allows you to view the camera footage without taking out the micro USB card. If you remove it and place it into a adapter then you can easily use it with you computer to view and save shots or videos. For me to post a video I need to take this stream and convert it, so I will post that as well.fact that my power ports don't shut off when the vehicle is turned off.

"I was hoping for a dashcam that I could hide on my windshield, and have it record while the car was moving, hopefully saving me some grief and providing law enforcement with any evidence necessary should the time arise.<br /><br />Perhaps there is something wrong with my dashcam, but this really is not realistic for a number of reasons:<br /><br />1) the battery life is atrocious. Seriously, I would be surprised if this lasted for longer than an hour on a single charge. The 10 minute car ride to the store was enough to take out one of the three battery bars. This means that the dashcam needs to ALWAYS be plugged into the car charger. Even then, the rate of battery depletion is greater than the rate of charging. This results in tiny little recording loops, about 12-25 seconds each when the camera is on and plugged in.<br />2) One of the advertising points for this camera is the motion detector. I'm not actually sure if this works. While the camera does record when the car moves, again, the length of the looped segments seem compltely arbitraty, even at &#34;full&#34; charge. Is this because I was on the highway and there were few bumps in the road? What makes this even more aggravating is that the menu button doubles as an &#34;SOS&#34; button which will seemingly permanently record any recording that you made when you hit the SOS button. So while I am trying to reconfigure the settings so that the recording loop is longer, and so that more battery power is conserved, I inadvertently hit the SOS button. I now have at least 30 one seconds clips of my lap as a result of me trying to rework the settings, which brings me to my next point:<br />3) There aren't any instructions. Okay, that's not true. You get a bilingual sheet that does not help at all. For example, under the system settings section we have: &#34;5. Automatic video: Off/on&#34; What does that mean? Is that the automatic recording that I want? Is that to turn off the screen when the camera is rolling??<br /><br />There are other problems as well, such as the the date resetting itself. However, the main problem here is that I really can't depend on this camera is catch an accident.><br />There are other problems as well, such as the the date resetting itself.

Great case... Does anyone know how to attach the neck strap to the case?
I love speigen
"Zerolemon sent this item to test and review. This USB charger is by far one of the best I've seen on the market. It will charge using all three ports without any problems. I own a Galaxy Note 4, iPhone 6 Plus, and a Nexus 6. I put the charger in for all three of them and the results are as follows:<br /><br />2.1 amp port<br />Note 4<br />0%-100% - 3.5 hr<br />0%-50% - 1.3hr<br />50%-100% - 1.5hr<br /><br />iPhone 6 plus<br />0%-100% - 4.0hr &#60;-- Smaller batter but took forever even on the 2.1 amp port<br />0%-50%  - 1.5hr<br />50%-100% - 1.8 hr<br /><br />Nexus 6 &#60;-- Gave same results as the Note 4 due to similar size battery.<br />0%-100% - 3.5 hr<br />0%-50% - 1.5hr<br />50%-100% - 1.7hr<br /><br />I didn't test the other amp ports as they would've taken forever to charge. But I did notice one thing, on the 1.0 amp port, none of the phones were losing percentage as sometimes the case happens with cheap car chargers that offer multiple ports but can only charge through one port at a time due to bad manufacturing or design. I had all three plugged in with full brightness, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluethooth on with Google Maps navigation on and the 2 phones, Note 4 and Nexus 6, plugged into the 2.1 amp and 2.0 amp port respectively, were slowly gaining battery, iPhone 6 Plus on the 1.0 amp port was not gaining any battery for a long time but at the same time didn't lose any battery.<br /><br />Yes the 2.1 amp is for the iPad but all phones charged on it faster then the 2.0 amp port. I plugged in the latest iPad (Early 2015 Model) and with heavy usage on the 2.1 amp port I saw battery decreasing slowly even though it was plugged in. I didn't get a time for the iPad because it would've taken forever. With light usage the battery will charge slowly about 1% every two to three minutes.<br /><br />Honestly if its at all possible just proved 3 ports with 2.1 amps, this would create much ease for any other passenger in the car trying to get a quick charge on their phone."
It was horrible it has all type factory faults will never purchase another phone ever again
It does the job and the price was right
"The pens are wonderful,i really like the colors and the s smooth way they write"
These are so convenient. I bought several and gave as gifts. They were so well received. Great value and quality too.
This case comes in handy when I'm attending formal events.
"Great ear buds. Easy to work, great sound. Use mine while working out, no problems. Worth the long wait to get them shipped"
Works very well and is as small as a deck of cards
I love this product. It is very efficient. I hope it lasts for a really long time.
"Great seller!! Arrived fast, love that it feels soft and not bulky but already dropped phone twice and this case has proven worthy. Gonna buy more in different colors for friends who love mine."
"looks awful and scratched up immediately, but at least it's the case being scratched and not my phone."
great
great
I have nothing but expectations met great sound quality pairing was easy and love the color
these speakers replaced the outside speakers on my weekend warrior toy hauler.
This is an excellent watch and fitness tracker.  Ordering was easy and arrived on time (even on a Sunday).  I have been very impressed by the watch and would recommend highly.
Easy to apply and does the job!
Had to return after a month.  They didn't work.  Also didn't hold a charge.
Nice material. Good grip. happy with the quality
Very Good
Loving this case so far.  Have dropped my phone several times from 3ft+ and have had no issues thus far.
just what I needed.
Incredible!  This is one of the best stylus's I've used.  My ipad responds very fast.
"Great protection, but case discolored and looked dirty after only a few weeks."
Needed this for a road trip. Excellent to keep GPS running in the car. WOrks a long time before a charge. Excellent.
"Nice quality, worked great,"
Dissapointed in this product. Really cheap and I am going to have to buy another case. I do not recommend this product. I do not have any problems with the seller.
"I couldn't be more pleased.  I have been using ZAGG products for years, and although they protected very well (never had a screen break even after dozens of phone drops), they do eventually get really awful looking with little scratches, edge peels, etc; and I could never install one 100% air-bubble free.  This Tempered Glass screen protector for the Samsung Note 5 installed easily, and crystal clear.  Not a bubble in site.  The coverage doesn't go 100% to the edge, so I will have to take the phone out of the case monthly or so for a full cleaning; but I am very, very pleased with this protector.  The proof will of course be in how it handles in a drop."
As was promised
Best selfie stick
So cute and great for iphone user! I bought one for my friend and wow it saved us so much time!
Had it for a few months and is holding up well
Lots of vibration which makes looking at directions cumbersome.
Did not work didnt do anything waste of money
"Very nicely made little pouch, hard exterior protects my Nano Ipod. The hard exterior also means if I am listening and touch the pouch the setting do not change!  Love the colour, I have the plum one.  It fits the Ipod but it a bit short if I want to zip it up with the head phone jack plugged in."
"I recently switched to this case (purchased for about 13% more at a local retailer). I was coming from a much bulkier folio-style case on my iPhone 6 Plus. This thing is fantastic. It is very solid, even though it is also very thin. I have found that Apple Pay works better with this case than my old one because it can get the phone closer to the reader. I also am able to use a wider variety of mounts and holders because of the smaller size.<br /><br />I usually don't use cases on my devices, and the main reason that I choose a case for my iPhone is that the edges are so slippery. I can get a good grip with this case, but unlike a lot of silicone cases, it doesn't pick up dust and pocket-gunk.<br /><br />One thing that isn't mentioned very prominently anywhere here is that the front corners of the case are raised above the screen just a *tiny* bit. Not so much that you'd notice without looking directly at it. However, this has the benefit of raising the glass face of the device off the surface of a table if you like to set your device face-down.<br /><br />One minor complaint is that it is very difficult to get the phone back out, though not impossible.<br /><br />I've been using it for just a few days and regret not buying one sooner."
Good solid case
Love it
We absolutely love our new Garmin.  It was a replacement for an old Garmin.  We went for all the bells and whistles this time. The cool factor is the split screen when you approach a major freeway intersection and it shows you which lane to be in.<br /><br />We got the one with the case because it is a convenient way to store it when not in use.
"Fits the tablet, well protects well I am very happy with it."
Charges really fast. I like it and the length.
This phone case was in great condition. Thanks
nice product.
"I wanted the cologne so badly that I didn't see that this was after shave.  I was so disappointed  I did not want after shave.  I also didn't read the fine print that said I cldn't return this product. My husband will use it but he didn't need it, nor want it.  We want the cologne. My fault for not paying attention to detail."
Great
Not bad at all.
Very good case..fits lg g4bwith leather back.
well i give a poor rating just because it did not adjust the output voltage at all... turning the pot screw
excelent
First set had a hard time staying charged but they were awesome and sent a replacement.  Things are working fine now.
good quality and good price
Was very glitchy and I had to return it
Broke within 2 weeks of use. The white part just snapped...
Great case so beautiful
"Buy this right now! If you don't love it, I'd love to know why. This thing is the best one out there and i've tried and had to throw out 4 cell phone holders already because they were total garbage. This one is the best! It suctions to the wind shield like crazy. It has not fallen off once in the few months i've had it. Not even remotely loose. Snug as anything on there. And, there are multiple ways to adjust the arm; towards you, away from you, right left, up, down. The phone can either sit on the little ledge at the bottom and then is ratcheted in tight on the sides with the braces or if you have your phone plugged into the car charger you can just flip up that little bottom ledge so it's not in the way and just use the side braces. It's so easy and fits snug. My phone has not accidentally fallen out of this thing even once and there are no little rubber parts or foam parts that can melt off due to the heat melting the glue. (i've had ones in the past that had these). This is all plastic and it's perfection! I want to buy 2 more just to keep on hand in case the thing does break somewhere down the line. I can't live without this thing in my car."
Quick delivery and they seem to take more charges before wearing out
"I bought this cellphone, to save money on calls made in wifi, but nooooo,  my minutes were going  fast as I keep checking the balance with the tracfone widget, even calls to tracfone costumer service to fix my issue were not free eigther."
this case it was delivered four days later then expect. it's tight and it really doesn't fit my phone when I put it on it takes the back off of my phone. I hate this case. It took so long I just went the the place I bought my phone n bought on for 20$ it's nicer and I needed one asap. This is crap and I don't recommend.
Looks great- haven't dropped my phone yet so unsure of protective qualities.
Worked for a week. Then phone would not except the cable
"After having the newer large suction cup and having them fall off with temperature variations, and even damaging the interior as the detector drops, this mount is VERY secure. For best results though make sure your visor is one that is level with your roof line and hood. Otherwise you have to tilt the visor to align correctly. And yes it does fit the SOLO 2 and 3 models."
"Good headphones, easy delivery, esay to use. The only bad thing is there is no other earplugs to accomodate your ear .. what you see is what you get, also it comes with a separate plastic cover to use I guess when you using them so sweat doesnt get to the buttons but it doesnt make it easier to use. It also used to disconnect out of nowhere..  not a good buy"
"Best screen protectors ever. I accidentally put it on upside-down the first time, but once I tried the second time it wrnt perfectly. No bubbles, and is very smooth but not a weird matte like feel to it. I have only used one for several months and it doesn't look like it's coming off any soon. Would definitely buy again if I needed to!"
"The phone was damaged, although advertised as &#34;In mint condition&#34;. The sound up and down button did not work,and the phone does not show how much charge there is, dies without warning. I paid premium for this piece of junk, was not returnable because I had opened it and by the time, my son , for whom I bought it became aware of the problems, it was over a month."
Same good quality as always
"As everyone else is saying, it's not protective. But if you want to be able to feel your iPhone and look nice. This is what you want. My phone feels nice and thin and looks great but again, would put a thicker case on it if I were going out and about."
Great product!!! Will be buying from them again.
thank you
"Fits well, seems lie it will hold up better than some of the other cases for the old Xperia. The back of the case is better quality than some of the more flimsy cases we have tried. The case doesn't block the camera like many of the other Xperia cases do."
Fits perfectly no need to buy a new radar.
"I love this case! It's pretty and it fits perfectly. I did separate the blue rubber piece from the hard plastc piece and put it on my phone first. Then I just clamped the hard plastic piece over the blue rubber one and voila! perfect fit. My only criticism is with myself for not reading the description thoroughly. I thought this was an all in one case, with a front cover. It's not. You'll need to have a screen protector, too. I despise those things, but this case is so pretty. I'll find someone who knows what they're doing (not me) to put the screen protector on for me."
Really good. Have been using it for 4 months now and still looks brand new. Very convenient and very stylish. Go everywhere with just my phone now. Whether it's a party or school. Not one gem came off regardless of the rough using.
Very convenient product ! Charges two iPads two iPhones and 2  apple watches  quickly at the same time and still have another slot to charge something else and I have another outlet  ! Looks nice and  sleek ! Very happy and would definitely buy from these guys again ! Shipping was fast !
Great case.
"Everything is right with the holder. color, adjustable, size. Like it a lot and it goes well with my bike !!"
Great screen protector!
Works great. I've had it for about a year!!
"Fast Charger! Works well with my Samsung Galaxy S5 and S6 cell phones, as well as my Samsung Galaxy tablet!"
"Perfect. Recommend it highly. Fit my iPhone 5s to a t. Easy to install. Love especially the High Impact Hybrid Armor Silicone material. I give it 5 stars because it is such a great case. My only wish is that it would be provided in more than the red color. And after two other tries with buying other VAKOOS &#34;suggested&#34; cases in the same ad by the seller as having the same silicone material, I can tell you for a fact they do not."
"I purchased two of these to charge my new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, one for work and one for home<br /><br />PRO's : The unit is small, very stylish and looks good sitting on my nightstand.  When I place my phone on it it begins charging right away.  There are a lot of blue LED lights that blink while the phone is charging and stay solid when the phone is charged.  On my desk at work, I live this product.<br /><br />CON's : I wish there was a way to turn off the LED's and they can be very distracting at night.<br /><br />OTHER : While this unit does come with a USB cable, it does not include an AC plug in.  I discovered that if I use the quick charge AC plug that came with my phone with this charger, it works great but if I use a cheap non quick charger it charges very slow.  I ended up going to Frt's and spending $20.00 to get a AC 2.0 charger to plug this into.<br /><br />Also I don't know if its this charger of the Verus S6 Edge plus case I bought but the phone will not charge wireless with this charger and that case and I'm not sure if that is an issue with the output of this charger or the thickness of the case."
It sucked
does not fit the edge 6
"nice, smart"
"Just a replacement phone for my little brother, got the job done."
It seems to work as well as the Apple cable but much more economical.
It's a wiring harness. Geez
nice!
Love it!
"I read several reviews before purchasing this case. This is everything i expected fits like a glove and was easy to put on phone, i don't think it took me 3 minute to put it on phone."
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY... THE PINK FADES INTO THE WHITE VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!
Excellent product
"I would give 5 stars however if these obtain any kind of distance from my phone, the music or conversation either stops or breaks real bad."
"This looks and feels nice. It was worth the money. The only downside is that it only has 2 places for cards, technically only one slot for cards and one for an ID. It works for now but if you ha e more 4 cards you need to carry this isn't for you."
"bad screen,,faded colors ,,unresponsive to touch after cpl weeks ,,started getting spots in it ,"
This case is great! It fits perfectly and is super durable. I am a terrible klutz but this case is withstanding my life style with ease. Not too bulky either.
Kept falling out of my phone and running down my battery. Even with it in my phone thought the s pen was detached
Good for the price but they stopped working after 2 weeks of use
Cheap phone for a senior... It works and works well.  .. If you loose it you wont care due to the price. .. Only bad thing is the weird charging cord that reminds me of technology from 10 years ago.
"A fantastic bluetooth headset if you only use it indoors. If you want a bluetooth that works minimally well outside of an office setting? Forget about this device. The second there's the slightest gust of wind, you can forget about the person on the other end of your call hearing anything you're saying. It will sound like you're being swept away by a tidal wave of noise interference. Don't believe me? Record yourself through your bluetooth and play it back. I did, after numerous complaints from people I had spoken with over bluetooth. You'll be amazed, and not in a good way. In short, the Plantronics Voyager Edge has the worst wind and noise cancellation I've ever experienced from a mobile device or accessory. For an item of this price, this is simply unacceptable. This is the last time I will buy anything designed by Plantronics."
this worked as it said its a cute plastic thing it looks cheap but did work so I'm happy
"Extremely buggy, the app is horrible and is an eyesore. It'll also randomly shut off power to the device at will.  I don't use it at all anymore. I wish I could get a refund."
love it
I love this phone
For my wife and she absolutely loves it.
"Did not work after only 20 days...and like most people, did not want to go through the trouble of returning it."
Great product. Works like a charm! Highly recommend this seller.
"excellent, as promised, display and recharge stylishly. Love it"
"Micro USB cables are one of the most widely used cables today, for a variety of electronics. While there are tons of different options and they may appears to be all pretty much the same, that is not true. Many products come with cheap cables that either A) Don't have the durability to last through extended uses B) Don't put quality material into their cord causing slower charging speed for your devices C) Slow data speed due to poor construction and materials. After years of hassling with tearing, broken, slow micro USB cords, I was so pleased to see a trusted brand such as Anker make a truly premium MicroUSB cable. This cable feels sturdy and strong right from the first minute you use it. The ends are reinforced to prevent breaking at the usual bend points. And the cable is reinforced with Kevlar to help it last much longer and withstand the daily wear and tear that we put our cables through. I'm also pleased to mention that the microusb end has a snug fit into my phone and doesn't fall out too easily like some other cheaper cords tend to do. Overall, this is an excellent product and the new benchmark of cables. I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Excellent
"For the price, I can't believe how long it's lasted me already! Easy to use. Works great!"
This one Crashes often. Please see the attached pic..Also Slow response and also the pictures taken by both the cameras are of low quality .
easy to install with the instructions included
It's good for its price but does not last long.
"I've been using this case for about a year now.  I like the slim fit, which allows it to slid into my pocket easily.  The rubber is starting to get a little loose, so it might be time to email Otterbox about a replacement."
pretty good case for a good price
"Very brittle, broke months after purchase. Beautiful image, but weak."
"It came in a timely manner, and is durable, but is a little hard to get off your phone once you put it on. Also, the picture is starting to peel off already, but it is serving it's purpose."
Just what I needed. Offers great flexibility for mounting GPS.
Stopped working after 10 uses approximately
This cable is fantastic. It snaps into the phone nice and tight. I notice that this cable also charges my phone much quicker than the factory cable.
Very useful in keeping my gadgetry peripherals in one place while traveling.
"Very excellent, i love it. The phone is perfectly design"
Great price great quality.
"Great case, hard to open slot where you connect to charge."
Great quality
Great case. Fits great. Awesome price.
"Contact issue. It won't charge, as the battery symbol in the display flicking, until I press it hard."
As expected.
"The case met my expectations. The corners are more of a soft rubber with a hard back. It is two pieces, easy to put on. It does add a little bulk to an already good sized phone, but I like it, I feel like my investment is protected. It arrived fast, good service."
For a while I had one that used suction to stick to the top of my dashboard. On many hot days it would become loose and fly off. I love this design as it mounts on the vents and never flys off.
Glass shattered during installation. There is no protective cover on the front side of the glass to protect it during installation on the device.  The instructions on the package do not correspond to the actual contents of the box for installation.  Overall poor installation instructions.  I have no idea who the product performs as I never made it that far.<br /><br />I have installed several Zagg glass screen protectors and never had one break before.  This brand is well below the quality of Zagg Glass.  The only reason I tried this brand is that Zagg does not make one for the Kindle HD 7.  A very disappointing result.
works
"As expected, this selfie stick is pretty neat. I love it! Handy and sturdy. I love the colors. Will definitely recommend to my friends."
"This is a great phone.  Good Camera, great specs, works great, never had any problems.  I really like the Windows phone operating system, and this was about the best Windows phone you could get at the time for T-Mobile.  I got another one, used, for my daughter, and it works great, as well.  Nice design, too, and decent screen.  Fast.  I do wish it had an SD card slot, but I never ran into a space problem."
Excellent product and very good seller ...
If charges my phone. Boobies.
Just what I needed for my phone!
I love it so much! Really does resemble the photos perfectly. Everything about it is the same. It's definitely silicon and soft. if you're looking for a cute case then you've found it! It's not protective bc of the silicon though obviously but hey every now & then you have to treat yourself to something nice for your 6!
I have purchased and used 3 Blu phones.  They all run out of phone memory even thought there is ample extra microsd space available.  onc either runs out there is nothing you can do to fix this problem.  You have to factory reset it and lose all your stuff.  On a weekly basis.  DO NOT GET BLU phones .. they are not working !!!
Good one!
Received package today. Thank you. Case fits securely and doesn't bulk up the phone.
"Delivery was early, so that was great! Protector goes on very easy, no bubbles whatsoever. Protect doesn't go all the way to the sides, but that's to be expected. I dealt with the same thing with every protector for my iPhone 6 plus. So that wasn't a deal breaker for me. Cut outs our dead on, so no problems there. But smudges!!!!!!! Smudges are ridiculous! Even with clean clean fingers the oil Smudges are pretty bad. For the privacy part. It does a very good job. If it wasn't for the smudge issue, I would have given this protector 5 stars. But I'm OCD and it bothers me."
as orded
Durable
"work very well, no issues with it"
A bit difficult to put on smoothly but very nice
"It works very well .a visit to typhoon lagoon disney wave pool.Completely dry phone. In water all day ,and photos came out very well. All i heard was where did you get that?"
"I've been buying everything Fallout that I can find. This little thing is cool and looks kinda wasteland style too. It seems to work just fine and is well made. The sturdy little wooden box attached to the cord with the Fallout logo on has a nice classy look. Also the item arrived at my house in California, from Latvia, in 8 days. Not working days, 8 days total. Excellent."
"Could never get rid of dust particles/bubbles.  Believe they came from wipe and cheap microfiber cloth.  Very disappointed in this, tried the tape but when you lift to use tape it just gets worse.  Also, didn't feel directions were clear that came with box.  Website had better insight but unfortunately by then my cover was full of dust particles.  I would not recommend this."
These work great protecting my Apple Watch.  Love the variety in color and the screen protector that was included is great!
Good product. at a good price.
"This keyboard works better than expected. There is no lag in typing and entry on screen. Connects just perfectly. And the best part is the amazing low price!! Don't waste your money on other keyboards that are more expensive, just get this one.<br /><br />I'm not sure why this is so inexpensive, but it rocks!<br /><br />I must say, I really love using this keyboard. I found it to be easy to use, accurate, lightweight, and the battery life even lasts pretty long."
"You get what you pay. It charges my Nexus 5 way too slow, one cable broke after less than one week, and some of these cables can't transfer data. I bought other more expensive cables and the other cables worked as expected, but these ones are just bad. Invest in better quality cables rather than quantity, hope this tip helps anybody."
I keep my Garmin in it at all times when not in use. Fits like a glove.
Ok
A gift for my niece...she loved it!
"I have an Otterbox case on my phone, so my phone doesn't fit completely in the holder, but it still is able to hold it while driving.  As long as I'm not going off-roading ( which I'm never gonna do in this car) then it is OK.  It take a few extra moments to get it to sit just right.  Would probably really easy if I didn't have the case.  right now I'm using the vent clip version.  The suction cup window/dash mount looks really nice and looks like it would hold securely. It has a sticky ring to help adhere and I'm a bit concerned to put in on the dash of how completely it may or may not remove.  The heat in NC might bake it into the dash  :)"
"Quick shipping.  Haven't had a chance to use it yet, but looks like it is just what I needed and at a great price."
"The installation was easy and the case provides great protection! You will NOT find a better case at this price, bar none. The kickstand is a nice bonus, though I rarely use it."
"Pretty much junk. The microphone was set to 100% on my laptop and still, people could barely hear me."
"It fits right, but maybe I need to wear it in because one side sometimes pops open all by it's lonesome. I believe it's working together with the elements to self sabotage. Maybe it doesn't like the fact it's a gold tab on a silver bezel."
This is a good car charger help keep my power  battery charger full
Exactly what I wanted
Good screen saver to protect your Pebble. Easy to apply and squeegee does the trick for smoothing any bubbles. Thanks!
These do not work and I have received two separate orders. I consider myself a responsible consumer. I read reviews and do research before buying. The information here said that these were reliable and if there were any problems I could return them. Well this is set number two that does not work and I don't have time to keep returning these.
"This is the second time I've used this product from this company. I have fixed a 5s and a 5c, and both have come out flawless. I've watched a couple of YouTube videos from iFixit and they have helped incredibly. The glass is very high quality and there have been no imperfections on the screen display. I recommend this product to anyone trying to save a few bucks, if you don't mind doing it yourself. The only thing I recommend is to be careful with the fingerprint scanner on the 5s, if you open the phone to quickly and rip the cable your fingerprint scanner will never work again. Just be patient and follow the steps for a successful installation."
EXCELENTE
good
"When I first got this case, I loved it.  It came the way I wanted it, with the correct monogram, color, and font. However, after around 5 months of use it started to break; but I had dropped it a lot so this did not come as a surprise.  The back cover started to peel off.  I ordered another one to replace it and after about 1 week of use the same thing happened! I contacted the seller asking for my money back and I received a response saying that it had been too long.  Do not recommend!!!"
"The original one that I received has great day time image with wide 170 angle ( exactly what we need for rear-view ). Night vision has horizontal lines covering the screen, looks like I received a defective one.  I understand it could happen for any product due to any reason, the most important point is how the company able to handle the issue for satisfying the customers.  Hisgadget Amy was so quick to respond to my concern by sending me a replacement with no extra charge, the new one performs great, out of my expectation.  Great price, great product quality, especially excellent after-sale service. Highly recommended, very happy."
works well with my phone
This unit resolves our powering predicament and seems to work exactly as advertised.
"Excellent radio. Get one, you'll love it."
I should of did this a long time ago. The audio quality is really good if your iffy. The only thing is when you turn your car off and on you gotta turn the adapter back on and when it turns on and connects it's a bit choppy for a few secs but after that it's crystal clear.
Great product and easy to use!  It comes with sticker hinges which makes it so simple to put on without any bubbles to deal with.  Best screen protector I have used.
Great product.
I got this for my auntie. She love it. She think she all that now.
Lots of features and possibilities. Sometimes to much information during the exercise. The instruction manual could be more detailed to allow a more straight forward configuration.
Doesn't actually charge
Love it
Love it
Received extremely quick.  Was easy to apply.  I like the feel of the screen much better with the screen protector on.  I just hope it does actually protect the glass from shattering.
Stopped working after one month
"Your case..product is perfectly fine. However I'm returning since it doesn't fit my husband's phone, even though it looks (on Amazon site) like it should."
"Fits the phone well and provides a much better &#34;grip&#34; than without the case. The (removable) kickstand is a nice feature to have, too. The included stylus is more comfortable than the built-in stylus. I didn't use the screen protector because I purchased a &#34;glass&#34;-type instead, but that's nice to have as a backup. I think a silver color might be a nice choice to match the phone's color, but the black works nicely, too."
works great!!
you need to have a case for the edge plus !
"For shockproof, this is a great phone case, but the waterproof part does not work! I was so excited to get this case because with a 2 year old i never know where my phone could end up. My phone was in this case and my daughter through it into the toilet. It was ruined. I lost a 600 dollar phone because i trusted this phone case."
Good price
I love this case. It doesn't  make the phone appear much larger and looks great
"Within the first 2 hours, I had to re-pair with my bluetooth headset 12 times.... just sitting, no movement.  The last time it dropped, I turned it off, reseated all of its connectors, started the pairing and got only static.... now the dang thing doesn't even pair. Another example of worthless Chinese manufacturing."
"Works nicely with the 15000mAh version and keeps it clean and protected. The case is a little bit longer which works out well as you can plug in the cable and zip it up with only the wire poking out. The mesh pocket is handy to hold the USB cables and user's manual. The zipper could be beefier, but then again, I haven't had any problems with it yet."
Bought these to go with a new iPad. My grandma prefers them to her finger. Worked as she needed them to.
Works without errors on the phones and ipads
Great case :)
Excelente producto !!!!
Great product
"Easy to install, works great.  No screen interference, touch scren responds great."
Battery last for a loooong time.
Ok
"Great unit, a little difficult to install so be patient.  Works great and map updates are continual/ongoing at no extra cost. I update maps 3-4 times per year.  It has my recommendation."
"Really nice case for the iPhone 6.  My only issue is that it doesn't have a kick stand.  Admittedly, I knew that when I bought it.  However, in hindsight, I should've opt'd for the one that has the stand on it.<br /><br />This is sturdy, fits well, and allows easy access to all of the buttons.  Five stars."
good
As advertised<br />Recommend
good price and quality
"I didn't even know extension cables existed until I was offered this one for review.  It's perfect when you just need a little bit more length.  It works great, phone charged fine.  You plug this into your phone cord to give it a few more inches.  It's great.<br /><br />I was offered a sample of this product in exchange for an unbiased review."
Big screen great details when entering or exiting the highway.  You don't need trip planners if you run the road a lot. I've heard negative things about the GPS units with the trip planning elements.  Learn to read a map and don't ever truly trust any GPS units with all aspects of traveling.  Great product for the price
This was for my granddaughter's phone and she is very pleased. It fits perfectly
Not good product not very durable pops off phone too easy when phone is dropped
"Perfect. I charged my tablet, phone and Bluetooth box and still have over 50 percent charge..."
I love the case already . Shipped faster then expected
"Great case!  Fits my phone perfectly, protects the screen, looks and feels like expensive leather...I love it!  This is the second Juicy Case I've purchased, previously owned one for my LG G3.  I love that you can see who's calling, answer calls take photos, and more without opening the case. The stand feature works perfectly both horizontally and vertically when you I need to work hands-free.  There are lots more great features, but in summary, it's the perfect case for me.  I highly recommend!"
good for price
Good protection
It look fancy and I did like it when I received it but after not even two weeks the magnet not working anymore I can close the case
love it for my grandaughter
"Otterbox, need I say more, fits great, excellent product"
excellent for the price
Appears to be a guality product at an affordable price.
"Less than the best jawbone. Noise cancellation is not as good as previous and battery talk time is short. The charging case makes it last the day though, it's super small and light weight, and the ear gel is comfortable. I always make custom gels for my Bluetooth headset, but these fit so well I didn't need to."
AWESOME PRODUCT!
Very good product. Sturdy and looking good (the red color looks better than the black one). I feel my iPhone is well protected in this case.
Needed this battery very much and it is working great in my phone.  Shall purchase from this seller again
The box was alright but after a short while the box starts falling apart and it rattles about ten times louder than the actual sub. Ruins the listening experience majorly. Ended up putting in screws throughout most of the box and still can not find the source of the rattling exactly.
Perfect Bluetooth
Slim and unassuming.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Not the most protective but it works for my needs since the 6 plus is such a big phone.
Love it
"I purchased this battery a few months back and I fell in love with it. It does what it says it does. It was a little bigger than I expected but I love the build quality of it. Its solid and not too heavy.  I usually just stick in my backpack and leave it there until I need it.  I have a Note 3 so having it is a big plus.  However, the original battery in purchased with break or malfunction, but the customer service department was great and a huge help in was able to provide a replacement really fast. I really recommend this battery and company."
Love this Bluetooth headset!<br /><br />Have had the product for two months now. The sound quality is excellent.  The headset maintains a charge for three days with regular use.  No problems with connectivity with my iPhone 6.
good
Great product.
A 'little' smaller than I though (although the dimensions were clearly posted). It's a well made case with a better zipper than I expected and a harder shell than I expected.
Kept my phone dry and damage free while working in the Everglades. Very happy with this purchase.
Broke down after a few weeks
Just what I wanted !!!
Easy Installation.  Looks good.
"So i had very high hopes...its a great idea.  Magnets work well and are strong.  The metal disc is small enough to go in the case.<br /><br />Everything was there for my perfect phone holder...until the ball wouldnt stick to anything.  Dash, side, door, whatever.  No sticky.<br /><br />Now to find a holder for my holder...."
"I originally gave this product a good review, however, I have to regretfully change it because it didn't last a month. Spend a little more and go into your phone dealer and get a real Samsung. This one is not real. It is much shorter than the real one and it just stopped working. When I took it into the store, they told me that a lot of these sold online are replicas made with the Samsung name and are poor quality. I really wanted it to work because the price was great, but I was disappointed."
This case works well and has saved my phone plenty of times. It's durable and also looks nice. I only wish it had more of a ridge around the front to protect the phone if it lands on its face.
"I've been a big fan of a competing case brand for several years and had not heard of Verus until recently.  I'm glad I discovered them, though.  This case is superb!  I really dig the hairline texture on the back; it adds style to the case and gives me a good grip on the phone.  The only complaint I have is that the corners are the hard plastic and not the TPU rubber.  I'm just afraid that the plastic will crack if I drop my device and it lands on a corner.  It may hold up just fine, though.  Hopefully I never have to find out."
Do not buy! Worst screen protectors I've EVER bought. They don't even stick to your screen.
Good price and helps out well.
Love this cable. It's really well made and super sturdy. Way better than the one that came with the phone.
"It is capable of charging IPhones, iPads, Androids, GPS devices as well as cameras and this even works on my Windows phone.."
"ok , Do i see a difference from this model in comparison with the regular UV5RA nope. feels the same quality is the same maybe the internals are different but i can't notice them overall i really love the brand Solid product!"
Good product
"I can't believe it is actually glass, so thin and flexible. Almost can't tell the screen has a protector installed. Easy to center despite what others have said, Infact, this is easier any other protector I have used this far. If you have an apple watch. Get this!<br />It comes with 2 screen protectors, various application tools( anti dust stickers, microfiber cloth, anti scratch bubble removing squeegee) and most importantly a lifetime warranty!"
Exactly as described.  Went on easily.  No glare and has protected phone perfectly.
Very nice product.
It broke after only one week
Nice case and fits the phone well!
This is perfect and fits the Note 4 without shutting off or adjusting volume. The switch works perfectly and it fits great.
love this
"I have invested in a great product who's price allows everyone to get excellence at low cost. Keep the price low, please. Thank you."
My case broke in 2 places the first day.  It broke in two more places during the 1st week.  This is a very cheap phone case.  I wouldn't recommend buying it because it won't protect your phone at all.  I didn't even use it for a full week before tossing it in the trash.  Waste of money.
"The belt clip broke but I was able to repair it, for the price you cannot go wrong. It definitely exceeded my expectations. I purchased a black for myself and a purple for My Wife, we are both very pleased."
"This unit has a small plastic roller that is on the top clamp. Looks like the intent of this roller is to ease installment of the GPS into to cradle and to prevent the cradle from scratching the GPS case. The first time I installed the GPS into the RAM cradle, the roller popped out. I was able to reinstall it after many tries. This was disappointing because I have always like RAM products in the past. RAM needs a better design for this roller. You must be careful not to allow too much pressure to be applied to the roller or it will come out."
Great headphones.
shipped on time and fits
I literally had this product less then a month before every single one of the cables springs that keep the cord in the phone went out and now and the cord just falls out of my phone
Doesn't fit the phone. doesn't stick when cut to size.
Excellent
"Several times i have thought about throwing my Bose speakers away because none of my iPods or iPhones work on it any more (different connectors).  I am so glad i didn't because with the CoolStream i can again use this unit and not just for Apple devices.  I have used the CoolStream to stream music from my HTC One M8 and Samsung Galaxy Tab, both using Spotify.  It sounds great. And super easy to set up, highly recommended"
Product simply does not work! Bought for my wife and the velcro closure will not stay shut. She cant even use it!
"I like this unit.  Both cameras have good resolution during daytime use, both on the road as well as within the vehicle cabin.  The software is easy to operate. I save my daily trips to my computer.  I drive daily & I do not drive without it.  The GPS tracking also is very accurate.  The only negative I have with THIS unit is the visual during night driving.  I plan to purchase the unit with the IR Night Vision feature (see below).<br />Indigi® Dash Cam 2.7&#34; TFT LCD Dual Camera Lens Car DVR IR Night Vision GPS."
better than expected!  5 stars!
"Awesome case! Bought this as a back up case, but I already use it more than the main case. The colors are fabulous, very sharp looking, and it doesnt come loose at the corners, so I don't play with it and ruin it like so many other cases I've bought.<br /><br />For tactile people the waves on the back are superfun to run your hands over. I don't normally like gild, but this is soft and offsets the blue bery nicely"
To me. It's great  hook it  up  the same day.<br />Fast shipping.<br />Great product  all around!
needed it
espectacular 100% recomendado
Works very well.
never really quite feels comfortable in ear. sound is OK and controls are a bit awkward.
love it! i get compliments on it every day
Didn't protect the glass
the phone couldn't be activated and never will be able to get activated again.
You will need to purchase double sided tape in order for this product to work. Adhesive page is worthless. Directions are also not clear as to where to separate the broken glass. Do not assume that it's the seam in the phone's edge. You pry the glass off from the very top edge of phone.
"product worked as advertised, easy installation. I was even able to remove the glass and reapply it to a new phone after a warranty replacement."
"These days with phones being so expensive, more than laptops even, you need to protect it with high quality cases. This one hits it right on the nail head. The material feels amazing, no sharp edges anywhere and yet feels durable. The face cover is something new for me and so far it works like it's not on the phone face. A great added feature to know that your screen is protected by another screen. Headphone plug, charger plugs are protected really nice to prevent debris from going in. I love that feature. I'm also still able to charge my phone on the remote pad charger without having to plug it in.<br /><br />The section that goes on your belt is also solid. The clips doesn't separate from the receiving section, so it will be a bit bulky. I work on construction sites so this is the perfect case for my phone investment."
"Worked well for the first few months.  Eventually failed.  Has lifetime warranty, but there is nobody to to talk to to replace it."
"This glass screen cover is great for my iPhone 6, it's a lot cheaper then the ones they sell in the stores and just as good."
Love this!  So handy.
Very cute snap on case with all the great lines from Fault In Our Stars. No image smudging or off center placements. Really cute case and I always get compliments
Bad design. Sits off back of head and not adjustable. The ear buds constantly slip out of my ears. Weird charger.
The opening tool broke only after a few uses. The pin that is used to hold the suction cup in fell out and the tool is no longer usable.
Great.
Would not recommend plastic edges where the phone sits chipped off and I've only had it for a month.
For the price this is a great product. It's sturdy and easy to use. Nice silicone linig and can still put in headphones without any obstruction. Some are too bulky and u can stick the phone jack in completely. Great product!
I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. It is a nice case and good quality but not very protective. It basically decorates your phone. It's nice for that purpose
On the outside of the wallet I was expecting it to say crown like it shows in the picture. Crown was misspelled to cronw so I did not enjoy this product at all.
Excellent Thank You..
"A selfie stick is a handy thing to have and this one is easy to use, plus the price is right. You do have to ensure that the cord is inserted all the way in order to snap the pic. The one complaint that I have about this style selfie stick is that, while keeping my phone secure from dropping, the hinged area hits right where the power button is on my Android Galaxy Avant phone so, if I'm not careful, it presses on the power and turns my phone off."
Product exactly as described/pictured. Great quality for the cost.
Works great. The smaller tip works much better for drawing.
"The charging range seemed very small, and I had to be picky enough about placing it that it would've been just as easy to plug in a USB cable.  The plug is also very fragile and eventually broke off of mine, right before I would've decided to take it out anyway.  I'd recommend waiting until the new charging standards come out."
"It was a gift and my Son which uses daily to reach out to business associates loves it! Ease of use and features are outstanding,"
"LOVED IT,NEEDED A CORD"
Bought it for my 150cc Rowdy Scooter. Very loud and good sound .  Going to get it for my Harley bike in chrome.  The only daw back is the &#34;L&#34; shape mounting brackets. I had to engineer mounting brackets that would fit my scooter. The brackets were not clearly displayed on the picture used for ordering
"Poor customer service. Unit quit charging and the seller didn't flinch after I sent an email... Go buy a brand called &#34;tenergy&#34;. You will pay a bit more but the build quality, reliability and customer service is superior."
"I got this case in Turquoise Mint and I love it! I have had quite a few Caseology cases and they never seem to let me down.<br /><br />This case fits nice and snug and while it feels sturdy and protected, it doesn't add a lot of weight or bulk to the phone. The material is like a thick TPU and it is VERY smooth to touch. The color is vibrant and beautiful.<br /><br />I took one star off because the case needs to be slightly altered for the Verizon version of the Note 4. This is actually a common problem with the Verizon phones, the mic hole to the left of the charger port is about 1/4 inch farther away than it is on the other carrier models. This is due to the different chipset that Verizon uses over AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, etc. But it is an easy enough fix so you can get around it.<br /><br />All in all, I'd highly recommend this case.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. However your own opinion might vary. I received no monitory compensation and not required to give a good review. This disclosure is in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions Guidelines on Testimony and Advertising."
"My family and I really love the product. It is really great feature with 360 rotation, I can move my cell to every angle.<br />What a brilliant idea!"
"Can't beat for the price. Installed in my 2012 Kia Soul. Install went easy. Display is very clear, though small, but DVD's are very watchable. . Radio sensitivity not as good as stock radio, but still good. Once I figured the sequence, steering wheel controls installed. No extra adapter needed."
I got a single 15 2 ohm in a 1997 s10 that I go to compitions with and with a 1500 watt amp I do right around 140 db so really loud and as long as you alow it to break in for a good time before you turn it up then the sub will last for a long time
Delivered as promised - works great.
good replacement
Bag tore along the seam after first use.
"This came in waaaaaaaay too late. Like about two to three months late, when it said something like a week to two weeks. It wasn't even worth the purchase, either."
It worked great for the first month. Took it off yesterday and the protective film separated from the front frame...not satisfied with the product
"after few uses, the thing that holds the phone doesn't do its job anymore. It got lose!"
Excelente
"It came scratched. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want a screen protector that comes scratched."
Works great for my car!
"Haven't tested it in the &#34;wild&#34; yet but after the test I put it through I'm 100% sure it'll hold up.<br /><br />Filled it with paper and held it down with weights underwater overnight. (Weights were necessary since it floats, which is another huge plus)<br />Next morning opened it up and confirmed it's totally waterproof. It's not exactly pretty but it's a bag so, whatever."
Great low profile case
"The case has a nice look and fewl to it, the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars would have been a more non slip coating on the bottom which would prevent your phone from sliding on smooth surfaces."
"I love this case but it won't accommodate the lightening cable from Amazon.  (The Apple cords work fine.) Still, I like it enough to keep using it even though I have to take it out to charge it."
So far this case is sturdy  & battle tested. Phone is completely protected.
Really nice case.. Very good quality loved it!
This charger packs a lot of charge for its size. I can get 2-3 full charges for my iPhone out of it before needing to recharge.
What can one say but WOW- Got his a few days ago and it works great. Charges the iPad / iPhone fast. It does get hot even when charging the iPad alone. But WOW it does it perfectly.
H O R R I B L E
"The only thing is, when You want to use letters  at the side left or right is a little pain in the neck, to closedand the bottom to turn the phone to mute don't work"
This case is a fake.  And a VERY poor one at that.
These cases are fantastic. They hold up well and fit my iPhone 6 Plus perfectly!
The stand works as advertised. though be sure to make sure that when you wrap the cable around the tower part that it's extremely taught.
Lovee it!! 5 Star rating
"This flat USB A to USB MIcro B with a Micro B female to Lighting Male adapter works with just about any of my devices. IOS, Android or Windows. One cable to rule connect them all for power and sync.<br /><br />The cable feels expensive, though it's quite fairly priced. It comes with nice covers to protect the connectors. I expect these will get lost but they are a nice touch for a travel cable that may get banged around.<br /><br />Unlike most USB and lightning cables this is a flat cable. It rolls nicely and so far seems more resistant to becoming a &#34;rats nest&#34;. The USB A and Micro B connectors and the Micro B femaile to Lightning male are all finished in a soft-feel grey finish. The connector grips feel rich and nice.<br /><br />I like this cable and now I don't need pack at least 2 cables to connect all my travel devices for sync and charging. When I'm traveling little things like this make more of a difference than I would have thought. Once less thing toe keep track of and it works great so far.<br /><br />Because it makes my life a bit more simple and works well for me I'm handing this lighting/micro USB B cable 5 stars.<br /><br />Hope this helps someone!"
Plugged in iPhone 6. Screen said: &#34;This cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone.&#34; Phone would not charge. Sent cable back to Amazon within 24 hrs. Do NOT recommend.
"No wonder these are so highly regarded in the OP forum, the quality is amazing, the fit is perfect, tight so it won't slip out on its own yet really easy to take off if you want to show someone your amazing One and the Sandstone back. The hue of the case might be a little more clear than what you see in the picture, or at least that was the case with mine (Navy Blue), and gladly I can't report anything regarding the cell protection it provides since I haven't let it fall down on a hard surface yet, but if you're clumsy you might want to look for a little more protection, or the version with the corner bumpers.  09/15/2016: After more than a year and a half, this case is still working greatly and barely showing any signs of wear, even though I carry my cell in a waist pack with a bunch of hard items around it. I barely use my flip cover anymore as this is so much more convenient."
The battery is too big for my cellphone and I can't use it
Great
"Works perfectly, but would be nice if it had a longer cord."
Like it so far. I didn't get to try it in the shower yet.
"Very durable, affordable case. My only issue is the plastic is very slippery to grip."
"I have only used this once, but it's a perfect fit for the LG Ultimate 2. It gives a perfect grip when on the phone and it looks nice too."
"These bands are probably the best sport bands you can get for the price. Considering apple sells them at $50, I consider these bands are closest to the identical ones that apple sells. I have purchased 2 already and plan to purchase more. I really hope they provide more color options in the future as I will purchase more of them."
Good product but sometimes slips out of my air vents.
exactly what i needed and it was easy to find a video tutorial online. Never go to the apple store for help.
"Installed sub this week which replaced my old RF Punch XLC 10&#34;  After tweaking the amp sub gain output a bit, the sound if perfect."
"It's now the year 2015 and the iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard is still working as intended and in use since my purchase in 2007.  I am still able to connect to my iPhone 5, iPad 2 with the latest OS version."
This sucks I hated it. This product isn't waterproof lucky i didn't put my phone in water...
Works as advertised. This transmitter allows me to share my playlists with a work out buddy.
"I broke the ear hook on my Motorola Whisper, this fits great, locking into place on the earpiece.  Will order a new one when this one eventually wears out."
"I just received it and when I opened the package the case was the only thing in it, no charger, no cord and no manual. I want a refund or a package containing the items missing ASAP."
Stopped working after a few months' use.
I dropped my phone a few times with this on and it really saved it from cracking. The only problem is that its hard to press the volume keys with iyt on
Crap the paint peeled off in one day
"It comes with an easy applicator 'wings' that lets you align it without touching the edges - awesome.  Looks great, I don't notice any screen quality changes.  Just be 100% sure there is no tiny lint on the screen before you apply it.  It happened to me, I noticed 1 single strand of lint, so I lifted the edge of the screen protector with a knife and used a lint removing sticker they also include.<br /><br />Only problem I can think of is that it does not reach the edge of the phone, but doing so could cause it to have air bubbles around edge because the Galaxy S6's screen isn't completely flat."
liked it
"Magpul cases are always great value for the money, this was no exception. The one thing I take away a star for is the slight slipperiness of this material, though I'm comparing it to that of Speck's Candyshell Grip cases which are my overwhelming favorite. Wish Magpul would design in some extra grip (stylish as a gun case, of course) so that I'd be more confident my $1,000 phone will have a fighting chance of staying in my hand or where I place it."
Slips out of my hand way more than any case I have ever had. This is the first time i have shattered a phone screen.<br />Battery works when needed which is the only reason that I gave it any stars. Its starting to not always respond when i press the button. not sure if this is due to dropping it too many times.<br />I wish the back coating wasnt so slick and had a little more texture to grip to. I will probably be getting a Mophie instead
We love these! They last a long time!
was a gift and was great.No more looking for empty spot.
Exelente
Great product for a great price this is the best out there.
the screen came securely shipped. but after installing .. it was a bit loose on the edges.  which you anhide with a cover.  not a perfect 10
Case was slim and not heavy but has the potential to protect your phone when it falls. I'm happy with my purchase :)
"This is a great pouch; HOWEVER, it is NOT suitable for an iPhone 6 in an Otterbox Defender. The case makes the whole thing just too snug.<br />I ordered the next size larger (Iphone 6 Plus (5.5 inch) PU Leather Pouch with Back Clip and Magnetic Closure), which fits perfectly.<br />Before that I had a smaller one for my iPhone 4s. Love these pouches."
The rubber handle part slides up and down and so sometimes the button is not aligned with the slip cover and therefore will not work correctly.
They work as you'd expect a USB cable to work. The connector on one no longer sticks in my phone but I think that's because I dropped it and it landed on the connector.
Ideal headphones for toddlers. Highly recommended.
Great Little Product for the price.
Great selfies stick. Came as expected. Fits my Nixon coolpix camera perfectly and my galaxy S4 with a mophie charger attached to it. Great item. Extends perfectly without twisting for a great photo. Thank you
"I've been using these daily for awhile now. So far they've worked better and last longer than the original battery that came with my phone.<br />At this point, I can legitimately recommend these."
"Didn't work properly with my Note 4, very dissappointed."
"If I could give this a ten star rating I would!  This case is so worth every penny!  My daughter had this case on her Samsung Galaxy in a different color but same product.  She left it on the roof of her car and drove off.  A few blocks away she heard something fall and looked in her review mirror and saw her phone hitting the ground and breaking into pieces.  She was going approximately 30 to 35 mph.  She pulled over and retrieved the parts.  The phone case itself came apart in two pieces.  The backing came off and the frame also had separated. The back cover to her phone had popped off and the battery came out.  She collected all the pieces and put her phone back together.  To her amazement the phone still was in perfect working condition and there was only a tiny scratch on the corner of the phone.  The phone case backing did break and was unusable, but she could still put the phone case frame back on her phone.  We ordered another one of these cases.  This clearly is a superior product and we are very happy with the results!!!!!  It is recommended that you don't leave your phone on top of your car!  This case is sturdy and protects and cushions your phone."
It is a little heavy but fits nicely into a purse.
"I ordered this product because I needed a long cord and it did not disappoint! It's long enough to go from my surge protector to my bed and I can sleep on either side and not be limited by the cord. I highly recommend it for people who sleep with their phones, but still want it to get a charge."
long and good quality， very nice cable！
Good case
"Update: charging port broke. Can't charge the battery up anymore.  Wow this thing lasts awhile. the indicator lights are helpful, too. It's kinda bulky, but it's worth it for the amount of energy it holds"
As promised
"Awsome fit, and great feel."
When you spend as much we do on phones now days you want your phone to be protected.  This glass screen protector is awesome at protecting our Note 4.  It fits the phone well and so much better than plastic screen protectors.  The glass doesn’t take any of the sensitivity away from the phone like some protectors do and is scratch resistant.<br /><br />Installation was a breeze.  First was to make sure the phones screen was very clean and free of any dust and hair.  Then we placed the screen on the phone and it pretty much attached itself without us having to do anything.  We could actually see the air bubbles moving to the sides of the screen protector and disappearing.  This was so easy for us because we once learned a trick of doing the glass screen protectors in a steamy bathroom.  The steam weighs all the floating particles down so they are no longer floating in the air to land on the screen.  The moisture also helps the glass to adhere to the phones glass without using a card to get the bubbles out.  This method is amazing.<br /><br />I have received this product in exchange for an honest review.
Pretty cool!
The Apple certified USB cords arrived on time and work very well.  I recommend this product.
Condition was better than advertised but the phone will not update to current version of OS.  Will have to do some research as to why it's not on 5.0...I may just need to be hooked to a cpu and manually load.  Overall worth it for the price and condition. Would buy from again.
"Great to find a battery for this old phone (I don't want to upgrade), but the new batt does not hold a charge as long as I would expect from a new batt."
Works perfectly sounds great. However something I didn't know was that if you start to get static put your phone on airplane mode.
Nice case
Works well. On time.  Only problem I have is answering the phone. Can't hear the caller unless it's on speakerphone. Everything else is loud enough
Very nice and clear
Great kit.  Worked well and came with lots of extras to make the process even easier.
I've only had it for 5 days and the liquid has somehow leaked out. Not very pleased. I would like a refund or a replacement!!!
Wife is happy
Great product. Very nice.
Not  at all what I expected.
"Accurate heart rate. Connected to my Galaxy S4 using the Wahoo fitness app. All my Garmin devices are connected this way. The S4 has Ant+ hardware in it already and is ready to go. Garmin cadence and speed sensors, garmin foot pod, and garmin heart rate monitor.<br />Very pleased with all the garmin products I purchased on amazon"
"Edit: September 4, 2015  After receiving a glitchy cable that didn't work properly, I posted a one-star review (included below) detailing my problems and concerns with the cord. To my surprise, a representative from Anker emailed me the next day. She apologized and offered to replace it free of charge. The new cable was quickly delivered only a couple of days later, and to my surprise, it works as well as my official Apple Lightning to USB cables. Not only am I very happy with the new cable, I am even happier with Anker's prompt response in fixing the problem. After this experience, I would definitely order from them again. If there is an issue with their product's quality, they seem quick to fix the problem. Great customer service!  Original: August 30, 2015  After reading all the positive reviews, I had high expectations for this cable. Unfortunately, this cord or its connections are glitchy. Initially, it wouldn't charge or sync at all, but after some play, I finally got it to work. However, the cable will still only charge/sync when held up at a certain angle. If the cable is disturbed or falls out of the right &#34;place,&#34; it stops charging. You have to keep a constant eye on it. Yesterday, it took nearly a half a day to charge my iPhone because it kept quit charging at random."
Broke within a month...
Finally! Someone figured out how to make a true &#34;universal&#34; phone mount. This device uses a clever magnetic system that securely hold your phone in place regardless what kind of phone case you may have.  No double-sided sticky tape on anything like on other mounts.  Simply put they got it right!
Horrible fit!  Case would constantly fall off.
Actually this is the 2nd anklet I buy .... the first 1 I bought I had for a couple months and now it will not charge ... i didn't know an kernel offered an 18 warranty so I purchased a new 1 ... im hoping you could fix the first 1 I purchased from you ....
good phone for my elderly mom.  keyboard key
Great fit and all buttons works through the bumper.  just enough of a berm around it so that neither screen nor back rest on whatever you set it down on.<br /><br />Vendor shipped quickly and packing was sufficient.
High Quality part extremely happy with the purchase
Broke at the seam on top of view area after four days.  Junk!
perfect just what i needed
Really Nice
"This is a top quality charger, and a lifesaver if you don't want your device running out of power.  Its made well, and works well; that's about as good as it gets."
"Came very fast I love. It got dirty quick, any ideas on how to clean?!"
"Just what I was looking for, but had to add my own adhesive belt clip cause this only comes in a wallet version"
good
Works fine.
"these work great.  took some trial and error to get the right loop and bud combination for my ears, but once I did they stayed in great.  the range is better than most other Bluetooth headsets I have used as well, and the sound quality is good.  The battery seems to last longer than needed, I usually use them a couple hours a day and charge them every 4 or 5 days &#34;just because.&#34;"
"The product looks great, but the case cracked just by removing the phone from the case. You need to remove from the case to charge with most of my cables and my dock. Not impressed"
"After I watched a couple YouTube videos, I was able to figure it out.  Works great..  I saved the tools for when I have to replace the screen."
"Great sound, solid Bluetooth pairing. Battery life is good and recharge is fast. My biggest issue is remembering which buttons do what, but that's my memory, not a design flaw!"
Love the arm band. The material is soft. It is very comfortable on the arm. Fits like a glove on my phone.
"I do not like hard plastic or bulky covers. This cover is jelly soft, fits perfectly, does not detract from the look of the phone and does not add any additional weight or thickness to the phone."
Great.
"Great, works well, attractive"
This product is awesome. It cleaned up my charging station. I have a household with 9 people all with phones and tablets. Charges devices very quickly.
This phone only for talk and text. You can't  save  anything because it's not enough storage or download anything! You can't even get picture messages!!! This phone is crap!!!!
Stays on good and looks nice!
started fine...then the sound started to get static. now it disconnects at least once an hour with a sound that comes in an out and pauses and starts at random. save your money.
"I love the convenience of not having to unplug my phone anytime I need to use it, but the charging is much slower than with a cord and sometimes if it's not settled properly, it won't be charging at all.<br />Still, though, wireless charging is great."
"This thing is great. I was a little skeptical at first, figuring that it would be similar to several other chargers I have purchased  over the years with pitiful results. This is the real deal. The fit and function of the ports is definitely high quality, and it has worked perfectly, even on my picky &#34;device not supported&#34; iPad and iPhone 6.  I would definitely recommend this as probably the last phone charger you'll ever need to buy. Good job Anker!"
Got it for my daughter she loves it
Sound quality is great but battery life is short-about an hour and a half. Can hear my music over the sound of my riding lawnmower without having to turn the volume up all the way.
The case was a perfect fit and meet our expectations. Will order from them in the future
I love how fast this thing charges but I kind of wish the cord had a little less resistance so it did not pull on the part that connects to the phone so hard when stretched out
Thrilled with both items. Love the fact that it's compact and able to get a matching color to my Sony Walkman.  Fits nicely in my pocket.
Versityle Selfie Stick with multiple options for hieght standalone and mobility modes
good protection of the  phone but looks like it does not exist
"Works well, but no instructions."
"the headphones work well, sound is decent.  Headband broke after two months of use."
The iPhone 6 Armband comes in a little cardboard container. The whole thing is really thin; almost paper thin. There are two separate wraps for this product. One is for your arm which is big enough to fit any arm. The other is for headphones so they aren't dangling everywhere while jogging. My phone fits perfectly in the spot for it. There is a clear case so you can see your screen at all times. The armband is very comfortable to wear and does the job of protecting the phone and also allowing one to carry on with the tasks being done without worrying about the phone. It is sweat proof and also has a holder for keys and cards. I love this product it's light as a feather and fits me perfectly. I definitely recommend. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.
"***UPDATE 10.05.15*** 24 hours after my first review, a rep from Anker emailed me about the &#34;faulty&#34; cable. With very simple explanation, they were quick to replace it. Never really noticed a more persistent company that highly pursues customer satisfaction as they do. They sent me a new one and made follow up emails to make sure my new cable was working properly. I have no issues with the second one although it did bend a little bit not as bad as my first one. I'd give them another star for their great customer service.  I bought this in May, 2015. I guess I'm being nice with the 3 stars. 3 months later. I waited to make a review to see if the good reviews would hold up. Unfortunately, either I have bad luck with long cords (more than 3ft.) or just not really durable. I've bought a 5 pack with the 6ft cord, same brand, same issue.I've bought a white 10ft cord before from another brand and it worked great until it got dirty and turned black and it stopped charging. Decided to buy this with the great reviews but the plug to connect to the phone has been loose and wiggles frequently. One time I would charge overnight to wake up with no charge because it was either loose or just didn't charge unless you bent the cord to a certain position to charge, how frustrating, I haven't done that since I had a RAZr (yea remember those). In the beginning, it clipped right into the phone, very snug and tight, no wiggle. 3 months in, its not tight and hope to have my phone charge the next day. Would I buy another one, I'm not sure. 10ft & 6ft. Cord bad. My 3ft & 1ft cords still good but a little wiggle but not as bad, I'm sure it will not last a year."
Fits the phone perfectly even with the leather back and does not add much bulk to the phone. Best feature for me is the built in screen saver. One improvement would be to make it possible to use the clip with the phone facing out.
"fits great, nice and slim. I usually like to go naked but this is next to it. Plastic is of high quality soft touch material. Easy to clean. Great price!<br />Thinking of buying a couple more for back ups. Would recomend to iphone 5 owners becuase of the squared chamfered edges."
"Terrible , waste of money mine broke in a week"
"I love this case. I have the black edged case for my white Note 4 and it's a perfect fit. I had a similar case for my Galaxy S4 in the past that had a rigid side edges for extra grip. I wish this case had that but that's me being nit picky. This case has protected my phone from a couple falls already.<br /><br />The Note 4 is pretty bulky to begin with in my opinion so I really wanted a case that didn't add to that preexisting bulk. This case does well. After about 10 months of use, it still holds up great."
Works as it should
so far so good
Love it. I can charge my phone 3 times.
"Have tried several other trackers, and this is my favorite. I have to make myself exercise, so I want full credit for every step."
"Really nice earphones for only $20. I can actually hear the bass with these, and there's excellent sound isolation. The only thing is that the one I received has a straight plug, while in the pictures it's bent"
Awesome...very worth it...I luv this product...tnks amazon...hppy customer
"I needed a screen protector that was worth the money. Better yet, one that I didn't have to give a disclaimer about when handing someone my phone to watch a video. Thanks LABC!!! With the discount I got, I'm on cloud 9!!!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00PJCQA58 iPhone 6 screen protector, LABC iPhone 6 Tempered Glass, iPhone 6 HD Tempered Diamond Glass Technology NEWEST 0.2mm thinner thickness Protection Screen Protector by LABC - 4.7&#34; Inch Screen - Premium Ballistic Nano Anti Scratch / Scratch Free Ultra Slim Tech Armor for Apple iPhone 6 4.7&#34; - iPhone 6 screen protector (LABC-305)]]"
"I just received this product 2 days ago and I finally have a chance to use it today. The materials seems so-so, fitting with the price. The color is more of jet black rather than a gunmetal gray, which is to be expected. It still looks better on my gunmetal sport watch than the apple official milanese loop band since the official version only comes in gray. The magnet seems strong and would last for a while. What bothers me is that the band does not fit my 42mm Sport Edition gunmetal watch that I specifically order (see pictures). Luckily, my wife the 38mm and I put it on her watch and it fits it perfectly. I deduced that they sent me the wrong version (38mm) without checking prior to shipment. Who is in charge of quality assurance? I would not be surprised if all previous reviewers who received the band with a gap also received the wrong 38mm version. So either: 1) it was an accidental shipping error where a 38mm band was shipped instead of the 42mm or 2) the seller falsely claimed that they produce a 42mm but they really don't. I read at least one reviewer who mentioned that he received the band without a gap so I assume that there are 2 versions produced. I have submitted for a return request so let's see how the seller will respond and I will keep this review updated accordingly.  REVIEW UPDATED 9/10/2015 Seller promptly responded back to me and offered to replace with the correct 42mm black milanese loop. For my trouble, I asked the seller to send me a silver 38mm Milanese loop for my wife silver Sport band and the seller agreed to send it for free. A week later, I received both bands and they fit both the 42mm and 38mm really well. The 42mm is ever slightly larger than the watch connector but you can only see this if you closely examined it. To the standard observer, it fits perfectly. The 38mm band fits the 38mm sport watch perfectly. My wife loves it! The materials seem durable and the magnet is surprisingly strong. I would highly recommend purchasing the Milanese loop from Kartice due to the excellent customer service and the great value that you get from these Milanese loop."
I've used so many diff clips and they all just fell down. This is the best I've ever used. Doesn't move at all. I recommend it to everyone.
Great product!!!  The range is excellent.  I have walked up to 45 feet from the receiver and it was still linked.  Sound quality is very good.  Does not get interference/humming noises like I saw in other reviews when in use and on the charger at the same time.
This lil bluetooth was everything that I expected it to be.  It works well and paired quickly with my Galaxy Note 4. I mainly use it to listen to music while at work and it's great for that.  Battery life is about 2 hours and it recharges really quickly.  Call quality isn't great  but tolerable for short periods of time.  Bottom line this device is well worth the money.
"Installed this for a JL Audio 10w3v3 subwoofer, which is a listed applicatation. The diameter was just a smidge too large, but that smidge made it impossible to install cleanly.  I am currently nursing my sore thumb.  I finally had to cut it to make it fit.  It is in now, but took way to much aggravation.  The only thing I can say for it is this: &#34;What other option is there?&#34;"
Works great!! Definitely worth the money. It's not the loudest but it will do the job.
Great
"Light weight, quality, and durable. A great value!"
"They didn't fit in my phone, and would not seal the port."
"Love it!  However, the Led light went out on one side only after 2 weeks."
"What a great armband. Well-made with nice solid stitching and a Velcro closure, once on, will not come loose thanks to the two slots that allow for tightness or looseness. It’s also comfortable without causing chafing. The key slot is a nice touch but even better is the cut out for the camera, which allows you to take a photo without having to pull the device out of the pouch. The only thing is that you’ll need to remove any other cases from the phone for it to fit so depending on the type of case you have, that may be easy or not easy.<br /><br />Overall, a very good sports arm band that will surely last a good long time.<br /><br />I received a sample in exchange for my honest opinion."
Works as advertised... Good grip in the cup holder and good grip on my phone...<br />I'd have given it 5 stars if it had a little more flexibility range...
I received a discount on my order for a fair review and this is one of  the best car chargers I had thus far. I am normally picky about what chargers I purchase but this one charges my phone really fast. I don't really have time to charge my phone from the time I get in the car till the time I get out. I recommend this charger to anyone that needs to go from 0 to 100 really quickly.
Great Value came with screen protector and stylus.
"Liked this unit due to the flexibility of media types it can play.  I'm sure you can find a better option, but it will likely not be in this price range.  The only negative for me so far is the display and the difficulty of seeing it in bright sunlight.  This said, I'm not sure I read a review of any competitors that someone didn't have this same complaint.  Sufficient power to satisfy most though it struggles a little to compete with engine noise, still not bad overall. Haven't used the Blue tooth yet so can't speak to that features functionality.  Look at the price and features and I think you can't really go wrong here at this price point."
Great seller...products came as promised.
Absolutely love this screen protector
it is great as expected for a phone case.
"A quality product from a quality brand. A few considerations:<br /><br />1. The case is easy to take on and off because it's a bit flexible<br />2. Slim, but you can still feel the increased size of your phone. But the iPhone is slim to begin with so no big deal.<br />3. Buttons are functional, only slightly harder to press<br /><br />This case is for those who don't really want a case but need the protection. A worthwhile investment considering the hefty price tag on the iPhone. I was given this case for my objective evaluation."
I'm  very happy with it.
Works great with iphone 4s.
"It's a really good case, and pretty tough I've dropped it a few times so I know this to be true. A little difficult to remove again though."
"The first thing I want to mention is that this review is not for the above mentioned device but it is for the other Argon rectangle shaped speaker. The one I am reviewing is this…<br />Argon® Bluetooth Wireless Portable Stereo 2CH Speaker for all iPhone, iPod, iPad, Blackberry, Android smartphones and MP3 players. Rechargeable built-in battery [Red]<br /><br />Due to some amazon goofup, I received this rectangle speaker.<br />I love having a bluetooth speaker around which we can use say inside the car or even at home. Or when you go to beach or someplace. The argon speaker we are talking about here is a rectangular shaped bluetooth portable 2 channel speaker. The reason it is mentioned 2 Channel is because it internally has 2 small speakers and both provide a maximum output of 3W RMS per speaker. If you buy a single speaker like those circular or cube shaped ones, they usually have single 3W speaker inside, while this has 2. This way you can achieve stereo sound quality.<br /><br />If you look at the body of the speaker, it will look like small and big sized blocks arranged in some fashion. On top of the speaker, you have 3 buttons for telephone, plus and minus.<br />On the front of the speaker is the same pattern but you have a mesh sort of design with “Argon” logo on the left side. On the very right bottom is the LED light which is visible only when you are charging the speaker or it is turned on. It will turn red when you are charging it and turn blue once fully charged. When paired, it will blink blue light.<br /><br />The 3 buttons on the top of the speakers are for..<br />--Volume Up and Down<br />--Track Next and Previous<br />--Music Pause / Lift Call / Hangup<br /><br />Yes the same buttons have multiple functions. When you are playing music, if you press the volume buttons once and rapidly, it will increase or decrease the volume. While if you keep it pressed, it will change the track. The middle button with handset embossing is used for pausing themusic. When in a call, it is used to hangup the call.<br /><br />On the right side of the speaker is the charging port which is MicroUSB Connector. You have a Aux In available as well so you could connect a 3.5mm connector and use the bluetooth speaker as a non bluetooth one. There is a ON/OFF Switch as well. When you turn on the speaker, it will “speak” to you. Yes it says “Hello”. This may freak people initially. There is no tone etc, it will speak stuff. Like when pairing is done, it will say “You phone is now connected” and such.<br /><br />The volume of the speaker is independent to the volume of the device connected. This means that you can have very loud sound. The sound from the speaker is pretty decent and people should look at the price and set their expectations. Don’t expect a LG UE Boombox or Bose level sound here. For casual listening it is pretty good. The bass is Ok but many a times I felt that sound was tearing especially at higher volume. Overall I would rate ⅘ on the sound quality.<br /><br />The speaker will be shown as “Argon SP28” on your phone etc. Also I don’t know why but on my iPhone, I could not get the battery level display on the status bar. This usually works with most battery operated bluetooth speakers. These have 1000mAh battery inside it which is pretty good and manufacturer claim is around 9 Hours of battery but I am sure that is at a decent volume and not full blast.<br /><br />Inside the box you are will get the MicroUSB cable and 3.5mm cable. Overall decent enough speakers for the price and deliver a good value.<br />*I received this product in exchange of a honest and unbiased feedback and all opinions are based on my usage with the product."
"Excellent product. Works fantastic! Works fast. The only thing wrong with this power bank is that it does not come with an AC adapter. If it did, I would give this 5 stars."
I've only had the case a few months and it broke. But other than that it was a good case. I would prob buy another one.
A bit pricey but SO much better than that little add-on charger piece that is sent with the original device.
Great value.  Cover goes on easy and stays on.  Can't beat the price compared to more expensive versions
"As much as I would like to give it 5 stars, it deserves a 4 (just because I'm nice), but maybe even a 3. The reason is that is uncomfortable to wear, as the phones weight brings the cardboard down on your nose, making it an annoyance and actually hurts my nose. So to fix it, I just a napkin to somewhat cushion it, though I am now looking into other products of better quality. This was a good introduction, and I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Though for the price range, I would look at other products that offer nose support, and I honestly believe they are overpriced and should at the most be $5, or less!"
Love the color and smoothness of the case!!!
"Jesus stop freaking begging me to review this, Amazon. Like a whiny two year old. God."
"No access to Mute key. Completely covers ear speaker and lower speakers causing low volume and muffled sound. Description says &#34;access to all buttons&#34; then later says &#34;except mute key&#34; it's quite deceiving. I've only had this for one day, it fell from the floor board of my LOW car to the pavement, and the lanyard holder broke in half. I really don't know how this has had a 5 star rating up until now. It is very low quality, especially for the price."
Exactly as described and good price.
"i received this product in exchange for an unbiased review the shipping was fast and the package was secure and safe, no broken parts made of durable materials easy to install with clear instructions fits my Iphone 6+ perfectly doesn’t interfere with the camera all ports and speakers work perfectly stylish. It is thin and lightweight but very good protector i have dropped my phone quite a few times and i also keep in a large purse, my phone is very safe and well protected"
I can't believe how great this works!
"These headphones didn't work unless they where plugged in. When i had them plugged in to charge, it would show a red light for about a second, then turn blue. On the manual, the red means it's uncharged, and the blue means its fully charged. So, when i would unplug the headphones, they would turn off instantly, and i could not turn them back on unless i plugged them in. ( They were charging for 2 hours prior), Unless someone can help me, i give these 1 star."
Securely holds my phone (Galaxy S6 Active w/ a case) and the suction cup is amazingly strong.  To the point where I have a hard time getting it off the window when I want to move it to a different car.  I was completely unable to remove it until I found the tab in the back and even then it was not easy.<br /><br />The one complaint I have is that the tab to remove it is tucked away underneath an overhanging piece of plastic (see the product photo) so it's hard to get a good grip on it.
dosent come with stand
I've had this case for a couple of weeks now. I LOVE it!  Very protective but not bulky. Perfect balance. The built-in screen protector is perfect. My only complaint... It doesn't come in purple.
"One of the best deals I picked up this summer. No more juggling between low-battery devices. Also, I neither recommend nor condone juggling while driving."
It was great.  Good quality and easy to slip on phone.
"NOT WATERPROOF!<br />Do not buy this case! I bought this case to take my phone with me on a white water rafting trip. I made sure to test the case thoroughly before actually trusting it with my phone. It was in the raft the entire time and never got wet except for the occasional splash. The case didn't last at all and soon the case was trapping water in more than it was keeping water out.. Afterwards, I took my phone out of the case asap and it was completely drenched. There was even water inside the camera underneath the lens! It's truly a miracle that my phone is still somewhat operational. I would not recommend this case to anyone!"
A great fun phone case and conversation piece. Kids love it
So I lost the back of my phone and decided to use this to replace it (I know its not a replacement) and it fit perfectly! Plus it has some awesome grip texture on it! I love it! And the design is awesome two ;)
"Works as advertised, both horizontally and vertically, and a good value.  Crafted to clear all S5 openings well.  I am satisfied."
"My daughter does not like it, I want to return it but don't have the receipt. I lost it somehow. Anyway I can return it without a receipt??"
Works great and it's pretty rugged.
My husband loves this case!
Great!
"The item is simply crap. Not only that I received it more than a week to late, the item is not at all like described! CHEAP CHINA PRODUCT!"
Great product.
"***IMPORTANT: DOES NOT COVER THE ENTIRE SCREEN***<br /><br />Last swell Monday morning, I started the work week off by dropping my beloved Nexus 5 on the tile floor, and DESTROYED the screen.<br /><br />Groggy, unhappy, ordered a Nexus 6, my favorite case, and saw this tempered glass for sale for cheap on Amazon. Lots of reviews, didn't bother to read any of them (hindsight 20/20 this was my real mistake). I glanced over the notes and read that the screen cover did not go over the entire screen. Didn't read it fully, figured well ya, duh, cause if it did all the bumber cases would peel it?<br /><br />Fast forward a week, received the screen cover, and immediately thought they sent the wrong one. It doesn't cover a LOT of the edges. Went to the order page, and of course, this is supposed to be this way. I didn't knock stars off since it's my fault I didn't read. Initial impressions is this thing is very flimsy, I didn't even think it was glass, since I've never seen glass bend the way this does. Time will tell if it's any good. If I did it all over again I would get a regular screen protector so it covers more of the phone."
Believed it to be for IPhone 6 but actually for IPhone4
The 10 foot charging cord is so useful because you can charge your phone from anywhere in the room.  The only reason this isn't a 5-star rating is that you get what you pay for; these cords usually stop working after a couple months.
You can't beat the fact that for less than 30 bucks you can have a dual band HT. It does what its supposed to. Its no Yaesu but its $30!! If you drop it or loose it... NBD... a disposable HT!
"It's def far better than the cheap craps you can found online, much more sturdy. But, you fit much in it. That is if you put a card in every pocket, you won't be able to close it ."
Don't waste your money or time buying them. They are fake and the connection is terrible. They don't stay charged long at all.
Very pleased
It did not stick<br />In frustration  i just threw it a away<br />For the 6 dollars i spent on it i could not be bothered  to send it back
Easy to break. Cute. Nice add to phone
"The product and shipping ammenities were fine.  When I applied the screen, it took quite a while for the air bubbles to disappear (the instructions said a few days; it took a few weeks).  The screen also seems to smudge very easily via fingerprints and stylus use. I have to wipe off the screen with a microfibre cloth once every few hours, or it will start to build up and look rather nasty.  Edit: I was sent another one, and this time the air bubbles disappeared quicker than last time.  Still, it smudges really badly and has fingerprints everywhere. One of the pictures shows that it doesn't have any, but that's obviously not the case."
Everything fit perfectly
Great product.
"Looks exactly as it did in the photo and feels very secure. I had purchased the iPhone 5 version when it came out, so felt I should go with the same brand and style with my iPhone 6. Was not disappointed."
Excellent
"Product's home key did not work.  Company did say I could return it, however my husband had thrown all of the bad parts before I could."
"This really is a wonderful stand for your watch and phone. This stand makes it easy to charge both your Apple Watch and your iPhone and it looks beautiful as well. I don't have an iPhone, I have a droid watch and phone but this stand still works beautifully for them as well! It's made of sustainable bamboo, so it's not endangering the rainforest or any trees. It is functional and beautiful!"
doenst fit really good
Product is accurately made and fits perfectly on the phone. Looks very nice and seems very durable.
"This item arrived on time and the color is exactly what I wanted.  However, the hard OtterBox outter case won't completely snap shut.  Took it to my local Verizon store where an employee took one look at it and said that he was &#34;almost sure&#34; that it's a knock-off.  Evidently, the product's serial number doesn't match any serial number made for a 4S iphone.  He was able to get the case on well enough so that the soft cover is about 3/4 on; but this case will not provide much protection.  This is the first time I've ever been displeased with an Amazon product.  I bought what , I thought, was an OtterBox (that's how the product is advertised); and instead, I seem to received a fraudulent item.  Very disappointed."
"The only thing I can review at the moment is that the case looks as described. I only plan on using it during the 4th of July.  I do wish it had a snap on front to protect better, my bad for not reading description better as the one I had originally seen was front and back."
Not real apple ear pods. Volume did not work on mine.
Very good
"Nicely made, good material. It does obscure my phones camera and I need to reconfigure the phone case design, but it's fine as it is before and after. I would buy again."
The power bank is a wonderful tool to have to charge on the go. I love that I can use the light to see in dark areas as well as being able to charge me and my daughter phones at the same time with the usb while eating out on the road. Love how fast it recharge itself and that it can go in my purse. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to review this product.
Very nice case and a conversation piece as well
No good
"This case is as good as they come for simple cases.<br /><br />I don't like bulky, otterbox type cases. This case fits PERFECT, the button covers do not hamper pressing them, and the case doesn't feel cheap at all. It even helps with grip, and keeps the phone slightly flat off the screen when placed face down.<br />Now keep in mind, it's more to protect from scratches and such, not so much dropping. If that's what you're looking for, don't hesitate.<br /><br />CG"
"I love this little thing! I now have a few of these since I've purchased this first one! They are not only convenient because you only need one outlet port to charge up to 6 devices.  They are small enough you can put them in drawers and what not to keep out of the way! The quickcharge 2.0 port works significantly faster when charging my m8.  The other ports recognize what device you plug in and adjusts accordingly.  This is great for families, the tech nerd or the business man/woman on the go.  These are great for just about anyone these days with all of the devies that people have!<br /><br />Would purchase again!<br /><br />Note: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review"
Takes awhile to get here but I love the design and bumper but it's not waterproof tried it on my old iPhone 5c and it stoped working but it's an awesome case
Great product! Arrived early and exactly as advertised!
I like this case. I was looking for a case that was not bulky and i could easily grip. With this case i can get to the phone unlock it with my fingerprint and scroll better. I found that it fits really good in my hand when im using it. the rubber is not thick and all around fits nicely on my phone. One of the good parts of getting this case it came with a  screen protector. Fits goods and didn't take away from the sensitivity. I love the color it is just as pictured.
Excellent Apple Watch Stand and great value. The stand matches my 12 South stand for my iPhone  6+ and the look great together and keep stuff off the counter.
The only reason I gave it an extra star instead of 1 star is because of the price. You get what you pay for. The sound quality is the worst I have ever herd on a pair of head phones. They wouldn't stay in my ears and there was no different sized buds that came with them. I mainly was just buying these with low expectations. I wanted to try a cheap pair of blue tooth buds before I went and spent money on a better pair. So I tried these and I liked the idea and how it worked but these were just too low quality for me. So i have recently spend more money on a higher quality pair and i love them. Maybe ill give these to someone who are curious also before they go spending money on an expensive pair.
"excellent mount, would not expect anything less from Ram"
This doesn't even deserve 1 star. This is by far the worst product I have ever bought. These do not work at all and even worse the prongs have broke off all 5 cables that came with the order. Don't waste your money!!
"Good protection for the phone, But too big for a small person."
very cheap looking and wont stay clipped on the phone I just threw it away
Loud static noice. Not usable.
Husband likes it
great holder!
easy to use and worth the price
"Worked good, just as described."
Very good
Very happy with my purchase
Works fine but battery sucks!
So far works as advertised. Haven't tried multiple devices at once yet but have charged iPhone 6+ and iPhone 6s.
This charger works awesome. I have a Galaxy s6 with an Otter Box. It charges a little slower than the wall charger that came with the phone but more than adequate. It's really not super picky about how the phone is positioned  but the light will flash red/green immediately if it's not happy with where you put it. The charger is pretty small... smaller than I expected which is a plus. I haven't measured but I'd say about 2.5-3&#34; across the widest point. It has a nice rubbery top and bottom so it won't slide around and the light is tiny and not crazy bright as I've read about other similar chargers (ie. Lighthouse in my bedroom etc...). It charges until full and then trickle charges to keep you at 100%. Overall I'm very happy after a couple weeks of use and i would highly recommend this product as a great bargain and well thought out design.
With in two weeks of it being installed by a professional repair shop screen has white spots and in it. Also appears that glue is peeling away from side of screen.
Excellent price and quality. Fast delivery.
Working excellent.
"Best case I've ever bought, thats saying a lot! Fit and finish are outstanding. Quality build and protects the phone like it should."
Great item. This is my second one
Very bulky but fits well.
"small convenience, but not easy in/out of vent, two hands operation, and tilt down if the phone is not clipped below 1/2 way, but my phone has button in the way"
"This product did everything it was advertised to do, I just didn't care for it because it was so bulky. I purchased it for a lengthy road trip, but actually ended up purchasing a different product after one day of use."
Daughter loves it! very cute. great price for a well made case.
I've now purchased this case twice. I love how it sparkles. I've received many complements over it. My phone fits snugly in the case and I don't have to worry about it falling out. While you cannot fit a lot of cards in you can fit about six comfortably. As I don't like to carry very many cards I find it perfect.
Very Good.
As described; easy to apply
"I have a iPhone 5s , and this is working great.<br />it small and fits in my pocket . really solved a huge problem for me , my phone was always dead by the late afternoon . this thing will charge your phone and still have power left.<br /> Love it"
Best iPhone case ever!!!
Do not buy this case!!!!! I have a brand new iPhone 6 plus that is completely ruined!!! The bottom piece where you charge your phone is poorly made and comes open very easy!
"These are awesome. They really give that Xtra kick, nice clean sound. The way they are designed make them hard to damage with sound like other speakers. I'm looking for the other 2 from the from of my car now....."
Great Product will do business again!!!
Doesn't offer as much protection as I'd like.
Excellent product.
This product does what it is supposed to do and my search is now finally complete. I have always been looking for earphones that would not fall out of my ears during my runs and these do the perfect job. I was going to spend $100+ on some earphones but good thing I purchased these instead. I have used these on multiple runs and they never fell out of my ears. Without this add on the Apple earphones would always fall out of my ears when I am running since I sweat a lot.
"fits most USB cables, and is convenient and design is what I like."
"Was showing error when connected &#34;this accessory might not work with iPhone as it might not be certified&#34;. Bought two of the cables, one of them showed this error. Mine is iPhone 6."
excellent
"The car charger doesn't stay in the outlet and the wall charger seems to drain the battery, instead of charging the phone.  This cell phone bundle is crap and a waist of money.  I will not be ordering from ShockWize again."
"This is an awesome deal! The quality is top notch. The color is vivid and bright. I was very impressed with the texture and toughness of braided sheath. This is definitely worth buying.  I am planing on ding it but this time in different colors than the orange and blue set, although I might just order another one of these as well. I love em soo much."
It's good!!
My son loved it!
I got the clear one. Love it. It so thin but good enough for light protection. I normally do not like using the case but this one is really good. It's make me more comfortable to hold and also show the beautiful look. I'd recommended it.
Great product.  Works well with my lifeproof 6 case.
Very pretty and is slim (not bulky).
"I love it, great fit and lightweight"
Love this case !
Good fine
"Synced to my watch and cycle computer very quickly. Comfortable to wear, I don't even notice it after a few minutes."
Had to buy a new case. No one could hear me with my otter box on my phone.
Love the case. Durable nice and strudy
I thought at first the customer service was poor. They were very excellent I just couldnt find out how to get replacement. Quality product service and replaced broken one at no cost to me. Truly a lifetime warranty!!!
Works
Great item....beautiful! Thank you!
Did not like the quality of this at all!!
"Great fit. I would almost venture to say that it is a better fit than the previous screen protector I was replacing. Due to the curved nature of the phone screen near the edges, there is a narrow ring around the edge of the screen protector that does not sit flush for most brands of screen protectors. This leads to dust and lint getting under the edge of the screen protector and eventually allowing it to lift away from the screen (this is what happened with my previous screen protector). The iLLumiShield protector fits just the flush portion of the screen (which means that it is actually SMALLER than most other screen protectors, but that is a good thing in this case), and hopefully will not be prone to dust and lint getting under the edge of the screen protector. Very satisfied so far (2 weeks of use).<br /><br />Will update if situation changes."
We love this bluetooth speaker! We use it everywhere and the sound quality is crisp and clean. We listen to an eclectic mix and all the genres we tried sound great (but I don't know about rap/hip hop as the bass doesn't seem adjustable)
Thank you
Perfect fit for my iPhone5s
Great product  for the price
"purchased for my husband, a general contractor, to use on the job site.  The product is perfect for his needs.....protecting his Ipad."
"Very good cable, long and good quality"
"Works as advertised.  Convenient, light weight and accurate. Wish I could save music to the watch, but I knew that wasn't a feature at purchase.  Ideal for a beginning runner."
worked great and it was cheaper then wal-mart
"It looks so cute, but unfortunately started falling apart within two weeks."
looks good
-  the bluetooth is very bad if the phone 3 step away from the headset you loss the connect<br />-  the headset is alway fall from your ear<br />-  only good one is wenn the call coming you just take it and put in your ear ...you ready to talk ...don't ne
Received it promptly a very solid case and looks great on my new S6 edge plus no issues at all
Better than the more expensive versions and fits well in a small purse. Great for concerts!
Amazing phone case!  My husband likes it so much that when he change phones he order another one. He works in construction and he drops the phone alot and nothing has happened to the phone because of the material it bounces its like a rubber material. I really recommend.
"I'm a little disappointed, you have an annoying noise as if a loose cable on the left side, the sound is not expected"
Excellent product as described!
Took a while to come but works just fine
EXCELENTE
"Waste of time and money, if it does do what the description says you need plenty if patience to figure it out and I believe this item had a previous owner because there was a picture in the album of what look like the inside of a prison!  I have returned this item which is a better success then the overall item!"
"Everything you want in an iPhone charger!<br />1. Fast Charging<br />2. Unbreakable<br />3. Long<br />and looks nice especially if your iPhone is gold (Y)<br /><br />I bought two other chargers, and this was the best one for the price."
Good product and easy to use
Best and smallest case ever!! Recomend!
Battery was fine.  Did not fix my phone
"Fits great and does its job so far. I wish this had a screen protector, but its exactly what we needed."
"This thing worked great for my purposes; In a fairly quiet room, vocal only, undetectable (he was looking), batteries lasted for more than 90 minutes. Make sure it is directly touching your ear drum and you will feel like you are wearing headphones"
"NewTrent did it again with this case... an instant winner here!<br />Match this with a tempered glass screen protector and everyone will envy you!<br />It you want strength and durability without the bulk get this case... I have been using this same model on my iPhone 5, 6 and 6 plus... I have tried many others and none come close in offering such complete protection in a small form factor and the removal back plates are a nice touch to color match your iPhone. I am even considering pickling up a few as gifts this Christmas as everyone in my family is always complementing my Trentium cases."
"The little light blew out after about a week, if that lasted longer this would be 5/5.  I like that the light isn't always on, and for my phone (HTC One), it charges at about 1% per minute, much faster than most chargers I have used.  Love this thing."
Worked perfectly in my 04 Corvette.
"I like that it has 2 USB ports - very handy since it seems there can never be enough ports.<br /><br />It was difficult to test the air filter part.  I do not smoke and was not about to to test the product.  Great that it does filter though.  As a hayfever sufferer, I always am looking for &#34;natural&#34; solutions and an air filter like this would be one.  Sometimes filters can be loud but this one is not at all - perhaps masked by the ambient noise of the car.<br /><br />I purchased this at a reduced price in return for an unbiased review."
I received it in a timely manner and the fit is perfect. Nice product. Thank you
Slim case looks good kickstand works great.
"Daughter loves it, uses with IPhone 6"
"Bought this to use in a cruise ship and it worked perfectly. I could charge my iPhone, Fitbit, and iPad pretty quickly. It is light weight and the plug folds in to save space."
Love it
Works just like the original one that came with the nook.  Great price.
Perfect
"My 6 Plus fit in here perfectly. I am a short person, when I went to put it on my arm, I discovered it was as long as my arm above the elbow and was uncomfortable because of the size."
"Good design, and worked perfectly for expanding the USB ports in our car, as well as in our camper. Getting two units with two ports each was what we needed. The only downside is that they seemed to charge a little slower when both ports were being used. I'll have to do some test on it to see if that was just perception or reality, but either way, it wasn't a deal breaker. Great job!"
Scared to buy at first since it said used but has been a decent buy. The front volume buttons have issues but I bought  the interface for my steering wheel controls from a local  car stereo shop and wireless remote for it that I ordered from Amazon as well.
Does the case fit on the silver edition??
These phone sleeves are so cool. They really work to protect our phones. We wear them in the gulf to take photos!
"I received this case yesterday. I was pretty excited to put it on my phone since its a very beautiful case. Problem is there os absolutely no grip to this case at all. I brought this because of the rubber gripping on the back. Dropping your phone is a major problem with this case. This is horrible, im giving it two stars for the look."
Okay. I used to store the phone.
"I love my new case! I previously had a similar sloth astronaut case, but when I got my new phone I wanted to get a new animal. I love this. What I did not know was that this case also has a grip on the sides and unlike the sloth astronaut case I had before it is a flexible rubber to come off much easier for wireless charging :)"
"The screen protector have a grid of dots, as per the seller it's meant to improve the response to touching of the screen, but for me this is bad and I didn't get to use it at all because I just hate having to see those dots on my high quality screen colours. I wish I knew about this before buying it!"
I like the phone.
Very easy to use and very comfortable. Use it with Bluetooth earbuds which makes it even easier to use. I would highly recommend this brand to anyone!
Phillips head stripped out the screws holding the led in place.  All the other tools worked well.  Would definitely recommend over tools included in replacement glass kit.
Everything perfect
I need a new cable
"I like the product very much. Having four sub ports and three outlet plugs is very convent when traveling. The bad is the USB ports require have a power button that spins a fan, which hums and annoys my spouse."
muy bien
I love all Piel Frama products.  This is a great sleeve.
This case is amazing! It is light weight and protects my phone. The built in screen protector is very clear. I am buying this brand for all my families phones.
Do not fit properly in the ears keep falling off with slight movement of the head
"With everything having the ability to charge via USB ports, thus handy device transforms your wall outlet into a super easy to use charging station!"
Very nice. Thank you
Got this for my mom for christmas she loves it. It can fit into her purse and charges her phone and kindle!
"Fast delivery, works perfect"
Works as intended.
Excellent product and fast shipping
"Simple fast car charger. Works as intended. Can charge multiple devices at once, which is exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />In hindsight it is a bit large in width. Would be nicer if it was a 2x2 square instead of 4x1, but it functionally works as expected.<br /><br />4 stars overall."
"I've owned otter box, spigen, etc.<br /><br />This is the best case I've owned."
This is an amazing little device. It powers on automatically when plugged in and connects to my phone everytime after establishing an initial connection. The sound quality is great. I use it in my 2010 Nissan Altima and I have a LG G3 cell phone. I have no complaints!
BUY THIS PRODUCT NOW. You won't have to pay the $150 or whatever for the apple version of the stainless steel. This is so much better and so much cheaper. Now the product being cheaper doesnt mean it's cheaper quality. The quality is excellent!
I got the matte for my s6. Works amazing. Highly recommended
Hard to beat life proof cases and especially for this price.
cheap!
works great
An absolute must for any driver!
I installed this into my Jeep Grande Cherokee and it works perfectly. 99% of the engine noise was eliminated from my speakers. Very simple to install.
Very compact and well made
Great price for this size charger. Works fine.
"Good value. However some dirt etc can get in where the home button is, so I had to put a piece of clear tape over it. Looks kind of janky"
"After  Researching for the right case I decided on this one and it was perfect.  So glad I c hose this company after reading their reviews. Definitely would buy from them again, Thanks"
Cheap crap
Great case! Thank you!
"It is a nice case, not as safe or bulkly as the Otterbox but compact enough to slip in your pocket for a quick trip to the store without your handbag."
surprisingly a pretty good case
Like that my kids can't destroy their iPads now
great product
Perfect fit. Best case I've purchased. Material feels great.
"I Got The My Case , I Really Love The Color And The Look It Has To My Phone . i Also Love How Quick It Came In The Mail😍😍😊"
This was another one of my impulse buys and it was just as expected. Only thing I was concerned about was the kick stand doesn't really work and the case is a little bulky making it hard for me to text when it's on but it hold all my cards perfectly and money safely.
Definitely strong enough to protect my phone. Looks great with gold. Plenty of padding for back lens. Kick stand rocks
"Does not fit the phone well, had to order another case, waste of money. It is hard to turn volume up or down, or shut ringer off"
"Arrived on time, fits perfect and looks nice but looks to be engineered for the look Rather than protect."
Perfect
I love this cord. It lights up and is a better quality than the one that come with my phone.
Great deal
I put the iOttie on the dashboard of my newly-purchased Porsche for one weekend and it has permanently damaged the dashboard. This thing will destroy your car! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
Better than the Motorola originals that broke in a week.
"Works great, no problems"
Really good tools install this if you have the steady hands
Charge Iphone 5 more than 3 times and Ipad 4 once
"It works surprisingly well. I spend a fair amount of time on conference calls. With this unit I'm heard clearly on calls, I can hear others clearly, and functions like mute are readily available. The fact that I can pop this in my backpack when I need to travel is a pleasant bonus. Frankly, I didn't think I'd ever do that until I tried it. I've taken this on quick trips to client locations etc where it continues to be a great little phone. Technically, it was easy to pair with my iPhone etc... I'd recommend it to others."
"Good sturdy case, took my toddler over a month to break it. Considering she usually only takes a week or two, I'd say that's pretty decent quality for the price."
Broke after a few days
Excellent!
"Cheap and flimsy. Lightning end came off and stuck in my iPad, had to use tweezers to get it out.  Will never buy this brand again."
"Great case, very durable and covers the entire phone. A little difficult to take off but putting it on is significantly easier. Would definitely recommend!"
"This screen protector made all the difference in the world regarding using my Galaxy S4.  I put in on myself in about 15 seconds.  No problem and it went on as smooth as silk.  No bubbles.  When I use the swipe method for emails and texts, my finger just glides along the screen.  No friction at all.  So much better than my plastic screen protector.  This item is a bargain.  Love it!"
Comfortable and fits phone perfectly.
This was perfect
"Definitely agree with some other reviews. Case DOES NOT fit snug. Issue is more or the sides not staying. One side stays, they other side does not wrap around phone."
Was advertised as new but clearly was not a brand new battery. 1 Star *
Not a bad phone at all...
Didn't quite fit but I used it for parts to make my phone camera work.
Please don't waste your money
"I ordered the UP3 by Jawbone because I was curious as to my activity level during the day and interested in its sleep tracking abilities.  I have had the UP3 band for several weeks now and am very happy with my purchase.  It is so easy to use with the app installed on my phone that even my 5 year old likes to look at it to see if I am meeting me goals.  The sleep mode is a great feature of this product.  It is interesting to look at your nighttime sleep log and see how positive changes in sleep behavior impact my levels of light, deep and REM sleep.  Overall, I really enjoy my UP3 band."
"Use it on my motorcycle to keep my GPS phone charged on longer trips, camping trips, other longer outings. Can charge both my wife's and my phone at the same time and many times. Love it!"
Love them and keeping them.
Exactly what I was wanting!! I Love It!
"Worked as advertised, very simple to use.  Worked for iPhone 4 so I'm not entirely sure if it works for anything else."
"The S6 as we know is a gorgeous device. I wish that I did not need a case for it...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Slim<br />- Gives clearance if laying screen flat on a surface<br />- Nice texture on the back, allows for better grip<br />- Buttons / ports are not compromised<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Don't expect Otterbox protection<br />- The rubber material can pick up fingerprints easily<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Provides good protection but it's meant more for aesthetics. For what it is, it's great...buy it."
"Works well to make sure I can charge my cellphone while at work. Definitely would recommend to a friend traveling or who is prone to use up their cell phone charge quickly. After the main work day ends (6 hours on my feet), I sit down for the desk part of my work; I'll plug this battery into my phone and recharge it to maximum while I type at the computer. This routine repeats for five days until the weekend, when I recharge the external battery.  I think it could last more days without a recharge but I like to be sure."
This is a great product!<br />i had 4 other powerbanks and they we'r not as good as this!<br />Charges fast and has a lot of power. also small and comfortable . fast shipping too.<br />Im very happy with it.
Fantastic! Great buy at a great price.
"not water proof, but only water resistant. My phone got wet when I took it underwater, but I continue to use this case when I take my phone near the water to protect from splashes."
So far so good!
Very Good Look and affordable
I do not like that there is no place to keep the stylus.
Great use it alot
Good price for a great product. On a partially sunny day this panel charged my Galaxy S5 from 25% to 60% in less than 2 hours. I will be getting another for my bug out bag.
I love this case.  It took me a long time to choose one but I love Speck and will keep buying their products.  I have used it for a couple of months now and dropped my phone here and there with no issues.
They fit!!!!
Happy with delivery time and product! I like that the charger tip lights up to help see in the dark!
Holding up will.
"I tested this product out by charging my LG G3.  I was was fast, not surprisingly so but, good.  It is compact, lightweight and perfect for travel.  I love that my husband and I will be able to charge out phones at the same time if needed.  I like that I do not need my phone charger and can use the USB that comes with this one.  A big plus is that it has a surge protector inside to sustain reliable power.  I do not see any negatives to this product.<br />Sample provided"
Husband loves it.  He ordered this to replace his current one that has too scratched of lens.
"Came apart at the seams just over a month of use.  Basically, as other reviewers here have noted, it has a tendency to overheat, plus the head separates from the rest of the cord exposing the wires inside.  Although past the return date, it is still covered by warranty.  A quick online chat with customer service and I recieved a refund.  No need to return the defective item, as it is listed as discontinued.  A newer version of it is available, but a quick scan of the reviews shows the same design flaws.  I'll take a pass on it, thanks.<br />Seems strange that Amazon would put its name on such a shoddy product."
Looks great with the sport!!!
I didn't like it so I gave it away
"I was curious to see how efficient the solar charging element would be so I first drained the storage by recharging my smart phone several times, which it did nicely. Then I placed the charger in direct summertime sunshine during cloudless days in San Diego. Even after two full days it was not charged. I returned it for a refund and ordered one without the solar element."
Excellent case for my LG G3 with an additional cover. Well pleased with this case.
I love it
Really cute looks just like a game boy but too big for the phone.
"I like this charger alot! I have no problem charging my iphone or ipads, works great and fast. Love all the ports."
"Worked in the immersion test but immediately ruined the phone first time it was immersed with the phone in it. So you think, you get what you pay for, right?Ruined a phone with a real Lifeproof that had a crack in the edge of the rubbery seal. That one at least worked for a few months but Lifeproof did not honor their warrantee with two of three cases that broke inside the first year. Lies, dishonorable practices and planned obsolescence."
"Obviously not apple earbuds, mic is terrible"
This is a great case high quality leather I can't see why anyone would be disappointed.
"Love this product, very nice."
Product acceptable. Sturdy
"I’ve been using stereo Bluetooth headsets for listening to the music in the gym ever since the first such device came out and the mp3 players started including Bluetooth as an option. In my opinion there is absolutely no other way to unobtrusively listen to the music while you exercise. However, all the headsets that I’ve used so far have one major problem: they all fail due to the moisture within a very short period of time. So far I have not had any such problems with these headphones, but only time will tell if they manage to be an exception to the rule.<br /><br />The sound quality of these headphones is one of their main attractions. First of all, no wireless headphones of this size will ever be able to deliver the deep, clear sound that you expect from some of the higher end headphones, but these headphones sound richer and more vibrant than almost all the headphones I’ve tried before. They were on par or better than most brand name headphones.<br /><br />These headphones seem to feature passive noise canceling technology. They are pretty good at minimizing the outside sound while in use, and even when they are turned off. Several times I was in a situation where someone tried to talk to me while I was wearing them, and I had to take them off in order to hear what the person had to say.<br /><br />These headphones are probably one of the most reductionist ones that I’ve seen. They are just made out of two oversized earbuds and a connecting cord between them. This is the ideal form factor for the sports headphones. The earbuds are pretty large and stay firmly in my ears even during the moderately fast runs. The extra sports ear cushions make the fit very snug. The connecting cord loops around the ears but they weren't as tangle free as I expected, which gives the headphones extra stability. I’ve used them while running for several days and they stay firmly in the position. They score high on both the form factor and the comfort level.<br /><br />I have not used these headphones much for phone calls. In general I find Bluetooth headsets to be quite inadequate for voice phone calling. The mic on these headphones also seemed below average, but then again, I was not going to use them for telephony anyways, so this aspect of the headphones neither bolsters nor diminishes a case for them.<br /><br />I will be monitoring these headphones for the foreseeable future. If they manage to survive a year of use in the gym, and their battery power does not significantly diminish over that period of time, then they might be the best overall sports Bluetooth headphones that I have come across.<br /><br />**** Product provided free for review purposes. ****e not used these headphones much for phone calls.

"Very nice, sturdy case. Love the strap. Keeps me from dropping phone. Wish it had a slot for a stylus."
This thing is adorable! Although maybe make it a little more bulky so it can be protective.
I ordered the stylus and was worried we would not have it in time before our children started school and wow we had it in 2-3 days. Very pleased.
"I really like that there is a bit of side and corner protection. The main attraction for me was the amount of angles once could use the tablet in. Aside from the 3 indentations, you can also fold a cover in for 2 additional viewing angles. I could care less the magnetic strip used for the auto-wake function and quick opening/closing but it's a neat feature for those who want it. I've had my case for over a year and it still works and looks just like new."
Way more power than the original battery. 10/10 would buy again.
"Picture and description showed RED as the color of the case, when I got the package it was SF Giants Orange."
Just what my phone needed
Good product
💜💜💜this case is awesom ! I dropped my case at least 4 times and I had no damage to my phone!
It looks exactly like the Picture! I wouldn't recommend this case if you're wanting a lot of protection. It is very pretty and I do like it a lot!
It's already paid for itself. My phone survived a nasty fall without so much as a scratch. The case is easy to grip and adds little bulk o the overall phone. Plus it looks awesome.
I got these to try out this technology.  They were well worth the cost and I think they will hold up well.
"Everything went well, fits great, improved touch on the screen."
Excellent device for taking selfies on a selfie stick. The Bluetooth pairing is superb. Once paired to a device it can't be paired with another unless it's reset. This feature is good in a way since it always connects with the paired device instantly every time. I'm really happy I bought this after I've used the cheap Chinese makes which keep disconnecting all the time and add to the frustration. Just wish it came with a long around the neck sling...it's so small I'm afraid I might loose it. 😁
I just started using my solar charger on my bike rides. It hold the charge throughout my ride.  Throughout my ride  I also use map my ride and play pandora.  38 miles today.
"After 1 month of use, it's reacting very slow. Also observed sound is very low while talking on the phone. And now people are complaining that they are unable to here my voice properly. Oh my god it's sucking....."
I get a ton of comments on this case. It is super relaxing to watch at work when not smart people get me angry. Totally worth buying!
"Great phone ,cheap and better<br /> than Nokia Lumia 822.That one crushes sometimes for no reason.!"
So far is good lets see ho long will last
very light weight
works great.
Very satisfied!
"The kit looks nice in the car. Although the instructions are pretty bad. And the piece that is supposed to replace the lcd screen doesn't fit at all. Took me a long time to figure out that two of the brackets that came with the kit actually are used to put the lcd screen back in (note the instructions say nothing about it). After I figured it all out I was a very happy guy. Before I figured it out, very aggravated. Overall good product"
"It works, but doesn't fit properly around the camera which can be annoying. Not an exact replacement."
"The clip on the side that attaches it to the iPhone broke after a few weeks of use.  I had to use a rubber band to hold it in the case, but that had to be removed to use the phone.  I finally discarded it."
"These worked great the first time I used them -- easy to connect, clear sound, and exactly what I wanted. The second time I used them the sound started skipping. I thought this would be fixed by recharging them, but it hasn't fixed them. I can't use them because the sound skips every few seconds. Very disappointing."
"I love this case! Low profile, yet protective.  Looks great on my iPhone 5c."
Great price quality delivery
The product comes with two cables and one samsung wall plug charger. Out of the two cables that it came with only one works for me. The other one does not even register when you try to use it.
Nice to have the buttons open very thin should offer some protection in minor drops.
I have big ears. This worked great
Very nice
I can't connect my new head set to my phone which is the Samsung Note 3. I Have followed the directions numerous times after fully charging the head set.
"Work great, price great"
Display is the same as original from my Moto x. Very pleased with this purchase. Image is same. Responsiveness is the same. Color and brightness is the same. Installed easily with video from fixez.
Great little charger with lots of power.  This charger works perfectly and charges my LG G3 very quickly right to a full charge.
"works great, fast delivery"
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
"These headphones are great. I've owned a pair for about 3 years and loved them so much that I just ordered another once those kicked the bucket.  Not the best sound, but you can wear them in the car and still hear all the road noise.  That's a selling point for me."
Very satisfactory so far.
This thing Never worked correctly from day one...  There other models that work much better and cost less..
"Arrived on time, seems to be working just fine! Thanks"
It definitely protects the phone. I've dropped it a few times and it's still safe. It does block the front camera a little though.
"Great case that is low profile and quite protective.<br /><br />Four star because the buttons on the side end up sticking out. I bought this case to replace a bulkier protective one, and I found that the button would get pressed enough to shut my phone off in my pocket. if there were little less material on the buttons, or even just holes to allow the buttons to be flush or recessed with the case, it'd be better."
Doesn't stick to phone screen
Love the slimness of it. Just enough to protect it from scratches.
This phone case is not a good case at all. The coloring on the case peels off.
Love it 😍
Loved it...not too bulky but still very protective!
Very good
"This is an amazing little receiver. Heist Mode allows 5 devices to all be connected simultaneously (but not playing) so that you don't have to keep pairing, connecting, disconnecting, and unpairing. Every other Bluetooth device I've ever owned has had issues with connections so that it needed to be routinely unpaired and repaired so that it would recognize that yes, it was supposed to be connected and doing something. The Moto Stream has no such problems. The use of microUSB for the power connector was also a great choice because it makes it easy to find a way to power it without needing to carry a separate barrel plug charger."
Great phone at a great price.
"Like the phone a lot.  This phone replaces the HTC evo 4 g.  The screen, and sound are superb and it is very fast.  I am suprised at how good my battery life is.  To my suprise I was impressed with how easy it was to convert my data from the evo to the desire 816."
It works as advertised
this charges my phone really quickly. i love it!
"This case is very slim and looks great on the Space Grey watch. All of the cut outs fit the watch perfectly, leaving the digital crown exposed, as well as the side button. I had only hoped for it to be a little more shiny, but that's not a deal breaker. I'd recommend this to anyone with a Apple Watch Sport in Space Grey looking for a slim case that looks good.<br /><br />PS. I didnt install the screen protector because i already had one on, and the one that came with this case doesnt cover the entire watch face."
EXCELENTE
Exelente
I would give it 0 stars if I could. It doesn't work at all doesn't fit my phone at all. It feels like it was never supposed to work.
"I like this case.  A little tough to open and close the compartment at first, but it's getting better."
"I don't know how others are claiming this is an easy install. It's frustrating, messy, and the little tabs don't stay down on the edges. I've installed plenty of dry screen protectors on devices, I've become quite good at it. This protector requires way more work than what a screen protector should. Yes, I watched the video, sprayed my fingertips, continuously squeegied and sprayed and squeegied and slid the protector around. It just kept rising off the face of the watch around the edges and wasn't getting any better as it dried. Steer clear of this crap. Wasted both protectors that it came with, immediately issued a refund."
Great Product really reliable and good quality for the price. Might even buy one for my wife. Thank you.
as described
Great
very good case.
"I really like this case but it just tends to break from the bottom part because its thing in there, I wish they could make the exact same case but made of aluminum, they do have one that's it's made of metal or whatever but it doesn't look like this one so that's why I don't get it."
Thing is junk and the seller is about as bad. Would not purchase this or anything else from this seller. VERY BAD EXPERIENCE STAY AWAY!!!!
Product was perfect
"No.....They are exactually every bit of what you paid for.. Just don't press the fake volume to many times, and don't drop them at all."
Daughter loves it.
"DO NOT BUY! Had the screen cover  for almost a year, and when I installed it, it went on great. But recently dropped in and it hit the floor and cracked. The screen cover did not crack at all although. Isn't this suppose to prevent your screen from cracking??"
Didn't work. Had to return.
Love it
I love this case!  I actually use it for carrying my sunglasses in my purse to keep them from getting scratched.  I love the painting and enjoy seeing it every time I put on or take off my sunglasses.  I've gotten compliments from several people because this is such a pretty and unique case!
"Love the look but disappointed.  Thin plastic hard shell cracked along volume buttons within first week after one fall off my lap and onto the floor.  My phone is fine so I guess it did its job, but I would expect more resiliency from a case claiming to be so protective."
Exactly what I was looking for!
works great - very easy to use.
Sturdy yet flexible makes it to install
Unfortunately it did not work.  It feels extremely cheap
"They are really long yes, which is convenient. However, after about a months' nightly use my first one has stopped working. I keep getting an error that tells me 'this device is not supported'"
"This provided me the charge to fill up my phone's battery many times over, and it will last a long time if you don't need to use it, so you don't need to worry if you forget to charge it"
"no use at all, screen break in the third day. will never buy this again"
Works great for my iPhone 5S. Can't beat the price.
"High quality, smudge resistant & strong. Shipping was quick, too!"
good item & good price
No complaints. Seems pretty good so far. Basically getting 2 for less than the price of one from apple.
"The product was exactly as described in the ad and arrived sooner than expected.  My iPad and Bluetooth printer fix snugly and th ere is space to carry headphones, etc. in the outer pocket."
Ordered and paid for three of the Black cases only received two cases
This is a case of you get what you pay for.  The head phones worked when I was sitting still.  The sound quality was good and the BT connection was easy to establish.<br />The problem came up when I took them on a run.  They started to cut out often and more so the faster I ran.  I reduced the issue by putting the phone on my right arm.  It will still cut out if I turn my head.
"Great case.  It fit's perfectly and is really sturdy.  Love the kick stand, it makes it convenient for watching."
Great value
I just love it for going places. Everything you need is all together 😊
Worked great and saved us lots of money as Verizon did not carry replacement battery for our phones. Would have cost us New phones.
So so. Almost a 3 star but it's small and has most of the connections I need.
Very nice looking
Great price for the protection.
I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 &  I ordered this battery for it but it did not fit my phone.<br />Very unhappy.
"Excellent invention, I do actually LIKE and use this religiously in the car"
I am very pleased with this case although it got dirty fast it's a cute case I would totally recommend this case it fits my iPhone 6 perfectly 👌🏼👌🏼 AMAZING CASE!!
Out of all the NFC tags you get with offer the key chain one is the one I use the most because it is so portable they stick well and are great in high it like in my car in the hot florida sun.
Great product.
Great case for a great value
Love it...looks great...great protection for my phone!
"Wonderful product, I would buy another one."
not good with galaxy5<br />\
Fast delivery and phone was as specified
:) Great screen protectors.
I order 3 and only 2 worked.  The one we kept only works on one iphone
It stopped working after 3 charges!!!
Excellent product!
Good buy
Won't pair with my phone...
Super sturdy and works perfectly. No need to remove cds from slots before installing.
Loud. Fits good
"I had it for about two weeks, and it broke .<br />It worked greatly , just broke very easily ."
"Good fit, seems sturdy and looks good. Can't ask for more on just a cover"
"One capped out after a few wks now using the other one, price was reasonable."
It's good but takes long time to charge
This item burnt out after two uses.  Got really hot and quit working with a burning smell.
"Cute case for my lil sisters phone, she loves it"
"I returned my garmin dashcam, and change it with zero edge , and i am very happy with it..some has problem with mounting /keeps on collapsing but i suggest MOUNT IT ON YOUR REARVIEW MIRROR, check this item (iSaddle CH214) $9 in Amazon,  check it if it will fit your vehicle rearview mirror , its perfect on my Honda pilot..<br />I'll definetly recommend it !"
"Pros:<br />Attractive<br />Does not add bulk to Phone<br />Wireless charging still works.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Does not provide addaquete protection.<br /><br />I was using this case plus a tempered glass screen protector. A drop from 3 feet struck the corner. When I pucked up the phone the front and glass back were fine but the rear camera lens was shattered. Nothing struck the lens directly. While the front and back glass (being Gorilla Glass) may be tough enough to permit a slim case, the camera lens on the Note 5 simply requires a case that absorbs more inpact to keep the camera from breaking."
Good product
Strong product. I use on my road bike.
Great band! Just what I wanted. Nice quality & design. Only downside is if you are a small female. I'm not extremely small but I do have tiny wrists. My band is set on the second to the smallest setting.
Strap is extremely comfortable. I only ever notice it when my breathing becomes very labored.<br /><br />I use this with a Garmin FR410 and so far haven't had any connectivity issues. Fun and informative to look at data when you're finished with a workout.<br /><br />Much more comfortable than the rigid plastic counter-parts.
Very good and save place
Works well with Samsung galaxy S5.
I love this screen cover. It  installs easy an protects my screen as advertised. I would recommend it  as one of the best.
"Works great in my 07' Tacoma. The sound quality is as good as I could hope for, w/ loud bass. Finally allows me to plug in my ipod directly w/o using a radio adapter."
Fast delivery and overall I'm happy with the case
The edges peel up. Tried to reapply multiple times. The fit is really bad. Buy a name brand and save the frustration.
"I just got my RAVPower 15W charger. It works great! I live in sunny Arizona so there is plenty of strong sun here. I'm also a big fan of using solar energy as much as possible! I wanted a solar charger that I could take on my kayak camping trips out in the wilderness. I have a small tablet, flashlights, and batteries that I want to keep charged during my trips. The RAVPower 15W seemed perfect for that situation. I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I ran a test of the RAVPower 15W charging my HP Stream 7 tablet. (You can see the pictures here.) I found the following result:<br /><br />Charging Time: 45-minutes starting @ 11:15am<br />Sunlight: Full sunlight in late August at 33 Degrees North - device was laid flat<br />Device: HP Stream 7 Tablet (turned off)<br />Battery Type: 3000 mAh Li-ion polymer<br />Charge Result: 57% to 90% battery<br />Battery Change: +33% (~1000 mAh in about 45 minutes)<br /><br />Here is my take from the device so far:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Very fast charge for tablets and cellular devices<br />Better results than expected<br />Nicely Packaged<br />Material is high-quality<br />Well-built<br />Excellent customer support website with warranty registration<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />Charger gets VERY hot in the sun (maybe they should use white material for the cloth instead of black)?<br />Make sure you cover the device you are charging to protect from sun.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed with this charger. For less than $50 I have a great power source for my kayak camping trips!"
I gave the size of my case. But the case still did not fit my phone.
My phone won't work through the cover and it said it would. Some reviewers used the same phone and said it would. I don't get it but this worthless.
Perfect replacement for the one I lost.  Thank you!
"I bought this AC charger because it is UL listed.  A UL listing means that the design and manufacture both meet safety standards for protection against shock or fire.  If your adapter is not UL listed it could shock you or damage your phone/ipad/mp3 player.  A listed product has a UL file number printed on it. Verify the listing by looking it up on the UL website.  Listing by CSA, TUV, VDE, or ETL are just as good as UL.  Unfortunately, a CE mark means nothing as far as safety. BTW, this charger works great !"
"these are great when traveling. But i use mine daily, i love it"
Easily fit in Galaxy Note 3. Performed just as well as Samsung's. Excellent value.
Great
Awesome
Was very unhappy with it. The phone Holder was torn at the top by the closure so it wasn't able to be used.
Phone was shipped in a timely manner.  Looks brand new and works like a champ!  Very happy with this item!
"42 days.<br />I had planned to write a review based on the quality of this product as it certainly appears both sturdy and well made and it comes in an impressive box.  But I thought I should wait for three months to see if it lasts since it seems that is when it has been failing for many.  Mine lasted 42 days.  I was out of town and didn't take it with me for a week of that time so actually I got just over four weeks use out of it.<br /><br />There are plenty of choices for 30 pin connectors, but based on a clear failure rate that seems to indicate this won't last for more than 12 weeks and may not last four I highly suggest finding an alternative.  Although it does appear like a well made item, internally it clearly has a fault.  I hate to give anything a one star review but four week's usage is a new low, suggest alternatives to this one."
"I've had two break, and the company's response when I contacted them about it was to give me a link to buy more.  I did, but I'm not buying Jarv products again."
I can wear it in many different way's love it.
good quality
"Love this case, works great!"
It was an okay case and the back is really crystal clear
Bought two of these. They do not extend wide enough for iPhone6+ or Nexus6 except you try to pull hard enoygh to break it. Also one of mine came used as well. At least the rubber cushion for the phone edge looked depressed and previously used. Returning these today.
"Great simple, flexible, inexpensive shell case."
Factory new  again.
not working with my iPod Shuffle
Top skin came off wit first use of first two pens. OK as pens not good as a stylus
"These cables seem to be very well made and I believe durability will not be a problem.  I have a Galaxy S6 and these cables work great with it,  they have a very rapid rate of charge and they stay plugged into my phone securely.  I also love the color coding because now I can give them to my kids and they no longer argue over which cable belongs to which child.  Another positive is the variety of cable lengths in the package.  The 3 ft. cables work great in the car and the longer ones are perfect for the house.  The price is unbelievable for the quality you receive and so far I have no complaints about these cables."
Terrific!
Very thin and easy to put on.
Installed with no problems
I luv it. I will order another one.
Wonderful! Great to have an easy to use product with a free online help to install video too. Nice price and super fast shipping.
I purchased this battery replacement for my nephew as he is no longer able to charge his phone through a cable and relies on charging batteries outside of the phone and switching them out.<br />For the price and fact it's a Samsung battery it's a great deal. I haven't heard any complaints from him on it not working in a month.
Everything is there except a manual.  This installation is tricky because the button transducers hang by thin plastic.  I severed the on/off button and don't think I can recover my phone.  The screen does work as before.  Showing the phone charging.
Love it
"Fully charges my phone almost twice, and is small enough to not look bulgy in a pocket."
"These were pretty good, but the max volume needed to be better so that my friends who I game with can hear me better."
The description of this item was so not true!! It cracked and never even dropped my phone!! False advertisement!!!👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
"Love my selfie stick, works perfect"
"For me this products works really good. I feel that my electronics get charged fast. I don't know if it's just me but I swear I feel they charge faster. There is no heating of the USB box. For me I didn't smell anything. Nice color and small not huge.  I can attach all my cables and everything gets charged great without interfering with each other. I feel that this USB is charged with great power I really recommend it. Works great with my iPhone 6 plus, my iPad, my table light, my little fan and my mini microphone and it all works perfect everything gets charged.  It is convenient no need to plug many charges in the outlet. This makes it more easy for me I can have it on my table and have all my USB connectors at my reach. Nice looking and has a soft touch with purple USB connectors. I know this product will last me a very long time.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion."
"Love my new base, got it right before I was to start my new driving job for the school and its been a full month and its not budged at all moves around when I need it to and withstands all my putting my phone in it and out of it, I have an Iphone 6 Plus with a bulky case on it and it does not move the whole time I'm driving!"
It worked for about an hour until it started sounding staticky.  Guess you get what you pay for.
"This is the perfect wallet case. I bought for my husband who hates to carry his wallet and credit cards. He now carries his phone, drivers lic and 2 credit cards with some money and it all fits in 1 case. Does not take up much space and he says it still fits in his pocket if he doesn't want to carry it. I give it 5 stars."
"The absolute easiest screen protector I've ever applied.  Not one bubble!  Even without instructions, I had this on in less than two minutes and it's just perfect. Now let's see how long it lasts...."
It is and awesome screen proctect and it says that it has a life time warrenty. I cant find out how to send it back. I just cracked my screen and i need to send it back. They need to make it easier to send it back
Perfect for my husbands phone!
"very good for the price, quick delivery"
Great battery and the cover feels very nice in my hand.
Perfect. Exactly as I ordered and expected.
Excellent Thank You..
Heavy Duty Charger set. charges everything I have very well. I received a discount for leaving a review. I would but it again.
Didn't last two weeks
excelent
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🔥
"I bought these for the wireless feature. They are better than I expected, the sound is excellent and when talking on the phone everyone can hear me fine. I would buy these again"
"I really like this case because it isn't bulky and lets you enjoy the sleek design of the phone. It feels safe and very sturdy even though the two parts of this case slide together. Once you place your phone in it, its a little tough to remove it which is great. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have after market chargers and the opening for the lightning charge port is not small to accommodate other after market USB chargers outside of the apple brand and similar size ones."
"This product worked good for about a week, and then it stopped working, I guess you get what you pay for!!! Save your money"
"This phone is another Samsung slam dunk. However, it never got 4G for T-Mobile in the US. I don't know if all unlocked phones are going to have this problem. I really liked this phone and all of the features. If you're ok with not being able to get 4G than this will work for you. I did seems to get LTE service but it wasn't fast at all. Again, this could simply be because it's unlocked international.  Great phone and it's very unique. Would definitely buy again if I knew that I could get the speed that 4G has."
I like it.
just plain works.
So cool!  This thing really works.  I was skeptical but thought I would give it a try.  It really works well and charges the phone really quickly.  I was given this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  I would definitely recommend this product.
"I purchased this case after having decent luck with the last redpepper case, I wanted a waterproof case for my Note 2 and vendors that meet this criteria are few and far between.  I wasn't pleased with the shipping time but was willing to give the product a shot since the first case was ok.  I received the package last week and within the first 48 hours the side button rubber was failing and the button had fallen out rendering the product not waterproof.  Then within another day the front button was failing and again rendered the phone case useless.  I would avoid buying if at all possible, at this point it appears there is zero quality control going on in China.  Unfortunately the big water proof case vendors do not make a product for this phone so it looks like I will be keeping it high and dry for now."
Bought a puretalk prepaid sim card for this phone and the phone does not work/connect to the network. Lame...
Very happy!
great holder for my iPhone 5s.  Just what I was looking for - to use MapmyRide on my bicycle trips.  My phone is already in a shock proof case and fits nicely in this holder.
"When I had read all the mixed reviews, I decided what the hey as this would only set me back a few bucks. I purchased model 088 in red for an upcoming camping trip. When I opened the box, there was the radio, battery, & a small set of instructions on a piece of paper (which is nice, considering that per the reviews, I believe none of them had instructions). I decided not to program the radio channels in the radio, due to reading that once it's programmed, then you can't remove non stations. I also like the fact that the volume was a dial & not buttons, because then I could finely adjust the volume to the desired level.<br /><br />Overall, I was very pleased with the sound quality & complete play time of the radio. For it being such a small radio (think 2000s cell phone w/ qwerty size), I was impressed overall. The complete play time (with a fully charged battery- which takes approximately 3-4 hrs to fully charge) from start to finish was about 10 hrs. I used a micro sd card to play my music. The only thing is, if you are someone who wants to know what's playing, it only shows the number of the song. So I would recommend either putting different genres on different cards, or making an accompanying song list to reference. When the radio was turned off & turned back on, it picks right up where it was stopped.<br /><br />The FM radio reception was good & had no issues with it.<br /><br />Needless to say, the camping trip was more enjoyable with a little music to soundtrack to. I recommend this radio to anyone who is looking for a decent radio at a low cost."
Excellent product. Thanks!
"Great price, quality product, and arrived way ahead of expected delivery date. Yay, Empire!"
Very good substitute for otterbox.  It is more streamlined but seems to give the same type of protection for a fraction of the price.
Works like a champ
"When I first preferred them I was a little worried, but once we got to the camp site they worked exceptionally well. I was actually surprised by the range on them, and the sound is phenomenal !"
Works as described. Very handy.
"This thing holds my iphone 6 upright and effectively immobile in my 2014 Ford Escape.  The charging ports and 'cigarette lighter' port all work as advertised.  The spring release is reliable.  Granted, I've only had it a month but it gets used every day by my son and myself in this car.  You can't go wrong at this price."
Exactly as pictured and just what I wanted. Delivered promptly.
"I own 4 Anker products and have never been dissapointed. Their products are over-engineered and are built to last. I was contacted by customer service a year or so ago about an issue some customers were having with one of the multi-port charging adapters. Mine was fine but they offered, and delivered, a free upgraded versionhe charger. How are you going to beat that?"
did not hold charge
I love this screen protector! It works great and very easy to apply!
"Stylish and comes with an ink pen inside which is great for those at the moment, quickies or to sign a check, but who does that anymore? Anyway, you have to give a firm push when using this stylus. It doesn't sense the pen or rather the screen fast as I'd like it to...like the note4 phone. But it looks good and matches my<br /> Pwr+ Silver Metal Pivoting Flex Ipad Stand Holder."
units came as described in packaging...very good shape. Units advertise 35 mile distance...I haven't been able to get them to work effectively beyond about a mile...hoping they do better on the water...but so far not what I was looking for in terms of performance.
I have had the charger for three days and it works very well. Charges all my devices and is great for travel. Definitely worth the money. If anything changes I will update the post.
"Great, cheap case. Def get this is you are on the fence but want to save money. This case has kept my wife's 6+ safe from a toddler for a year now. The only drawback is the strange plastic covering over the passcode ID button. It wrinkles and warps a bit so using this would not be possible."
Good for the festive of color I put my phone in this while fishing just incase.
DIDNT LIKE IT AT ALL
"Fast arrival!  Also, made of very good quality, strong, and beneficial."
Great!
I love it. Item is exactly as described and pictured.
"Off to a strong start.  Only had this a week with light use, but my initial impressions are positive.  For the price point seems well enough made.  I like the metal rotating belt clasp, hope it stronger than plastic clips, which can be the weak link in other holster type products.  I will update in the future if my opinion changes.  Main reason for writing a quick review is just to let people know that my Galaxy S6 with a Spigen Slim Armor case fits perfectly, maybe a touch tight, but I think the holster may stretch a bit over time and honestly even if it doesn't its not so tight that it can't be used, but takes a bit more force to pull it out, not a big deal, don't let that dissuade you from buying this case.  Between the case and holster this very expensive phone investment should be a safe as I can make it."
Everything was perfect bus the measurments were uneven in the home button.
Arrived quickly. I would order again but the price has went up 20 dollars but the one i installed works well.  My screen is broke again though. Could be faulty
"Case is wonderful, protects the phone really well with it's TPU insert and hard case. The stand is a nicety that works well, and the side buttons feels tactile with good feedback. After 6 months of use and countless drops the case holds up exceptionally well. The aesthetics however is another story, the TPU insert is starting to discolor toward a slight brownish hue, the buttons coating is wearing off (but still works well), and the worst part is that the stand broke off. I can put up with the discoloration, but I really wish the stand was built stronger to last the expected abuse."
Not worth it. The mic is too heavy that it pulls out the other side.
Very pleased with this arm band. Does what I need it to and fits perfectly. I would recommend the arm band extender for those with average to larger sized arms.
I love my phone and was looking for a case that would be thin and allow me to stick my phone in my pocket without a lot of bulk or rubber sticking to my pants. This case is pretty (especially on my white phone) and fits perfectly. I'm happy with my purchase.
very bad quality
As advertised.
"To our surprise, everything what could possibly fall apart, fell apart in less than 3 days. Not happy with this product, we had to throw it away as it was not serving it's purpose and it was not possible to put it together again."
"While they worked well for a couple months, the metal posts the speakers sit on have both snapped.  I don't see a way to fix it easily as the metal post inside the speaker needs to be replaced.  These might be good clamped to a pipe in your room, but don't use them on anything that moves because the vibrations will break them."
Charges my phone quickly and is easy to use.
It was not as expected.  It was made very cheaply.
"liked the product, unfortunately I returned the phone for a different model"
It is a very good product for the price.  I even brought one for my grand daughter and she love it. Easy to setup the Bluetooth.
"Very burkly and can't waterproof,DON'T BUY IT"
Dropped my phone twice and it's still alive. Looks nice and doesn't add a lot of bulk. So far so good.
I LOVE this case!  Wish I could find more designs like it!
Awesome and charges my Gear Fit without an issue!
"The phone is alive again for another two years, great.!!"
"This was a great solution to fixing a cracked screen.  Everything went smooth. I would recommend and buy this again, if need be."
"Used this for two years before the rubber sides started detaching from the metal backing. Dropped my phone many times, but this little beauty protected it well! A job well done."
amazing
Very good product from Maxrock .Thanks
"Poor performance, I replaced my battery because I had to replace my broken screen so I figured I would do the battery while I was in the phone and rejuvenate it, but no... This battery doesn't last as long as my almost 3 year old battery did. Luckily I saved my old one and intend to swap it back out when I get the chance. Don't bother buying this..."
This is such a great product and I am so glad that I got to try it.
Battery life is 2 days with everything on!  some say it makes the phone too big but i think its easier to hold and handle. It charges fast and lasts twice as long! Im very happy with this purchase The $8.00 honeycomb rubber case fits slightly loose and protects ok for the price. Strongly suggest the Seidio DILEX extended case. Cost more but protects better.
Perfect fit for the Samsung S5. and well made with good material.  Thanks!!!
"Thick cables, good price. Fit snug in phone. Feels like you could slam the door on them a few times with no damage."
Good
"Love it, every now and then it falls down but its still good."
"Excellent armband for a runner. Minimum bulk, lightweight, the phone slips in and out easily, easy to strap on and take off, safe and solid hold on the phone, the materials are durable, and the price is right. And no, I don't work for TuneBand. I got my first TuneBand for my iPhone 4 when that phone just came out and just got a new band for my iPhone 6. After all that time the old band was still like new. TuneBand comes with two different size armbands and if one of them doesn't fit they'll send you a smaller or larger or middle sized one that does (just reply to the email they send you that explains this free service)."
Great covers for the price
Works perfect.... no complains.
"Great price, fast shipping, product was as advertised. Charger works well for my battery. I will recommend this charger to my friends. Thanks again!"
old phone for this technology (2015)...but still a cool phone. reminds me of the blackberry.
Crap. Two of the 3 cords stopped working within two weeks of use. Only good thing I can say is they ship fast
So LOVE this case! The price was GREAT along with the quality! Highly recommend it to all Stanley Cup Champions Blackhawks fans!!!
"they gave me a free extra charger , amazing"
Nice item. Works well.
"Got this for our I phone 6 plus, and Samsung 5, works great for both phones"
Great case! No complaints!
"Two of the screen protectors were already scuffed up when I got them. Then the sticker that's on the bottom wouldn't come off. Long story short,  if you have a $700 phone don't buy $3 screen protectors."
Good product .
"I wanted the full 8 hour charge, didn't get it, even after charging a full day. Painful to me to wear, even though I tried all kinds of tips; also the way it curled around my outer ear was inflexible and hurtful. Maybe my ears are weird and I just got a bum battery, but returning for a different style."
"I found the IPhone 6 Armor Case not only attractive, a great buy but very duyone.rable.  I have dropped my phone several times and case did not suffer any damages, and the phone did not break or crack.  Well worth the money and makes a great gift."
nice product. i highly recommend this to others...
"Large, chunky, cheap feeling"
"These buds fall out of my ears.  I got them to use while running (wireless) so I didn't have a cord to deal with.  I have tried hard to like them but they just don't fit well.  The plastic pieces wear out quickly and they give you one replacement set.  (I'm already using them)  In addition, the documentation for the product is really light.  You can't find a website for them so if you lose the documentation it is a problem.  I had accidentally put mine into Chinese alerts so the alerts weren't in English.  Luckily I still had the documentation from the box.  The battery life is pretty good.<br /><br />I am really bummed I bought these."
Bad material!
I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item. I'd buy from them again
it charges slow
"I was in NYC and needed gps and apps to get around, borrowed a friends Anker to keep iPhone charged. I was impressed with the Anker and ordered my own when I got home. Great product, good value."
Very glittery<br />Loved it.
JUNK!!!!!!!
its a nice case but just like any of these types of cases ive had people cant really hear you on the phone. it is water proof which is nice and the case is made well but whats the point if no one can hear you talk.
Case is nice but was not delivered on time.
"Love it, the quality is very good. Fit perfectly!"
This works great and the strap is comfortable and holds on snug during any type of workout. I do think it is over priced considering the materials to make this isn't much.
I love the animal print. I was a little unsure of the case but i love it. Very good quality and my phone is safe from harm!
"Pretty awesome little compact car mount.  I have an existing iOttie Easy One Touch that has served me well, but needed something more compact for a different car.  I have it mounted to the side of a bottom center console, facing inwards into a pocket at the base of the console.  It's a tight squeeze with the gear selector right in front of it, so I wanted it to be as flush as possible.  Was a bit afraid if I could still do &#34;fairly&#34; one-handed operation as I could easily do with my One Touch, so happy to say it works flawlessly!  The swivel feature is great also for times while parked and trying to view a landscape video, for example.  I'm using this with an iPhone 6 and slim case and it works fine.<br /><br />Thanks!"
Life saver!  I rely on my phone heavily 24/7 and it's nice to have this little gem to save me from going &#34;dead&#34;.
Great replacement battery
This product works just great with my Apple Watch. I'm really happy about how well the watch attached to the Spigen and how reliable it has been. The only question I have is whether the stick-on base for the Spigen is reusable so I could bring along the stand when I travel
Awesome
I give 5 stars just because my brother said it work good for him.<br />He love it No complaints
so far 1 month..very good
"Love it, it is good for when I am walking do not have to hold my phone in my hand."
"It was supposed to be white lace, but instead it was just painted on."
it was just what we wanted
Just  as described.  It makes me feel like I have a brand new phone...
Stickers are the perfect size and have not peeled off like one would expect. Are extremely responsive and ive even accidentally spilled juice on a sticker that i have on a nightstand and it still functions.
Good!
Nice product and fast service.  It's not a real bass pounder but it adds to the overall sound of the car stereo
"These headphones are exactly what I've been looking for for past few years.  I bought these for running and find that they never fall out or adjust uncomfortably in my ear.  Problems I had in the past consisted of my left ear (for some reason) always fitting differently than my right.  Chewing gum would gradually shift them. And the up and down movement of running would cause annoying interference sounds.  Piece of advice... take the time to do a little trial and error with the ear pieces and cord clip while doing what ever activity you bought them for.  In the end it's worth every minute.<br /><br />For those with battery problem or just starting out, I strongly suggest giving it a full charge before using.  Once charged, keep using until battery is completely drained and repeat this process at least twice initially.  After that, continue doing so  at least once every one or two months.  I used to sell work for Verizon and found that draining or &#34;cycling&#34; the battery is the best way to increase any rechargeable battery.  So far it has worked for me brilliantly."
These are clearly not worth the list price (before markdown) but for super cheap they are great.
"This has been a great &#34;first radio&#34; for my 7, 5, and 3 year olds.  It holds as many songs as you will want to load... what I mean by that is that the MP3 songs are ordered and displayed numerically only.  There are no song or artist titles, just a number from 1 to x.  The volume from the built-in speaker is more than adequate for in the house or in the car.  We have found the battery life has been good too (we've had it for 6 months or so).<br /><br />We've used it on trips to let the kids take turns as DJ.  Even the 3 year old can manipulate the songs and volume without trouble.  Going down the highway in a minivan, it still sounds good even from the far back row.  We got it to let the kids learn to use an MP3 player, but searched far for one with a built-in speaker so that they were not damaging their hearing with headphones.  This is a really good product for the money, with the only drawback being that you cannot see song titles."
always ready when my phone's battery is about to die
Stopped charging after only two months use...will never purchase again.
Nice
Bought this cause lost my older jawbone era. Love the case it comes with acts as some extra charge. This unit doesn't hold charge as long as my older one. Fits well sounds great. Love the color.
This one I bought for my mom.She seems to like it
nice
we had one already and it broke so we ordered another shipping a little too high but good product overall
"MFI certified and braided.  Also comes with tech armor's awesome lifetime warranty.  No competition.  A braided wire can withstand 10x the punishment before there is damage and the data connection was flawless.  It does not feel nearly as flimsy as the OEM wire.  Plus since its backed by the lifetime warranty I wont ever need to buy a replacement cable.<br /><br />Personally, I highly recommend the 6ft version as you can always coil it up, however if you get the 2ft version and find that you need more length, you can't add to it.  I personally prefer the black cable as it does not appear to get as dirty."
very pleased
I like it
after a few weeks of having this product I thought it was great although the discomfort on not being able to move the ear buds in the direction that you may like to make it feel comfortable. I rate it a 1 star on account after the first few weeks it died on me and no longer works...therefore all I need to say is thank you for the rip off.
Ok!
Excellent
Good for short term use but will not last long if used every day
very good
This case is perfect for my zik 2.0
It does not fit my phone very well (iPhone 6 with Otterbox Defender case) and does not hang low enough from my rearview mirror (Honda CR-V) to fit my phone. Looking at ways to rig it so it's usable.
"Pretty sturdy case, I like the dust covers."
Outstanding product and service
Met expectations
"I had this watch for less than a month and it totally froze.  Garmin support was entirely unhelpful asking me to reset the watch, which I did.  Worked twice, then the same issue.  Garmin sent me a replacement.  The replacement watch had the same flaw. Sent back again, and again the same.  The watch freezes when you leave it on the charger or sometimes it just won't charge at all.  When it works, it's a great watch, though, this isn't a color screen as advertised. The colors are so incredibly hard to see.  The functionality is great, when the watch works.  But for the price, it's not worth it.  Garmin doesn't seem to care that there are a ton of complaints about the freezing screen.  Don't buy this watch until Garmin fixes the buggy software."
It never works.
"Great idea, although I haven't been able to get it to work properly only (2) or (3) times!"
Purchased as a gift for my husband and he loves it! Was describes very well and even came earlier than expected!! Would definitely but from you guys again
No one can here me talking unless I open the charger cover. Really hard to push buttons. Would not recommend.
"This is the second one I have received due to the first one falling apart just a week or so after receiving. Im hoping this one holds up a little longer. The replacement policy was great however, and a replacemenr was shipped in just 2 days."
Great replacement for the cracked lens on my Sprint Note 4. Pretty easy to install with the help of YouTube.  My phone focuses much better now and takes great pictures again. Haven't had a problem with it scratching easily. It's a well made product!
"This is a waste of money, even though I think I only spent less than $10 for the kit.  I consider myself a fairly decent computer/gadget tech and this is beyond anything a non-expert can perform.  I strongly suggest to anyone interested in this to reconsider and just buy the $80 kit."
good phone
Very satisfied!  Color was a perfect match with phone just as stated.  Couldn't be happier!!
Pro:<br />1. Can store up to 5 cards<br />2. Chain is a great accessory to have<br />3. Great quality case<br />4. Lighter than my other cases<br /><br />Con:<br />1. Card storage beside the magnet isn't recommended for use (It stretches the leather)<br />2. Card storage inside the case is uncomfortable to use<br />3. Uncomfortable to use back camera for pictures<br />4. The ring may be heavier than expected.<br /><br />Updated 10/02/2015
"So I don't know about you, but every now and then I love a nice long bubble bath. I've got my nice scents, light low and comfortable but the music is missing! I don't like taking my phone in the bathroom because of the moisture in the air and i like switching songs, but don't want to get my phone wet. This little device has solved all my problems! It's amazing how much quality sound comes from this little speaker. First, it comes in a hard plasic container so it doesn't move around or get damaged It holds a charge very well I can use it for a week and still have great strong sound. the ONLY thing i'd have a negative thing about ( which is NOT the sellers fault) is just that the suction cup doesn't stay... mainly because my shower walls are slightly dimpled so my walls do not provide the adequate surface... BUT i have tested on flat, clean glass and it stays pretty strong! I can change my music without touching my phone. I can leave my phone in my room and not disturb the connection :) I LOVE it!!<br /><br /> I was able to review this item at a discount for my completely honest, unbiased review!"
I can not take off my cover on my iPod touch 5
"Once I figured out how to set the device to random, I very much have enjoyed it. It works very well, though the &#34;random play&#34; setting does tend to pick the same songs with some consistency. Certainly, it has been a relief to not have to worry about cds sliding on to the floor and getting scratched. I think it is a good buy for the price."
it is easy to use and it's really compact size
Excellent earphones + data cable.  I wasn't sure if these wouldn't cause the dreaded &#34;voice control&#34; error with my iphone that non-oem earphones tend to do.  They haven't and work like a charm.  Another pair that I bought at the same time that was a bit cheaper and seemed just as reliable weren't and occasionally cause that annoying problem.  The cable seems reliable as well.
"Great phone.  This was an upgrade from S3mini, and it meets all needs, except one important one.  Kitkat operating system does not allow 3-rd party apps to write to the SD card, so it is not possible to use ES explorer or other apps to move files from PC to phone without plugging the phone into the PC.  This is a significant downgrade in capability, and I may have to root this phone to fix it.  I will wait till it is out of warranty to try, before I do."
I would not recommend this protector to anyone who wants a protector that covers the entire screen area. There are gaps on both sides of the screen because the protector is too small. I have attached pictures showing the issue.
"Solid construction. Had a problem sliding the case open to use the phone in hot weather - very difficult to slide.<br />As a result, I purchased another case of a different type."
Pouch works exactly as described. Very satisfied with purchase!
Awesome case
all good
its amazing
"Excellent value! I had some concerns the product might be too small and possibly scratch my ipad/iphone. That's a no on both! Solid construction, great look, excellent price. Well done Anker!"
"Great product - keeps me motivated to reach my fitness goals  -  This one was a gift<br />I brag about my Jawbone UP  to anyone who will listen<br />I had the bracelet  and  was not entirely happy . When it burned out I was reluctant to  get another Jawbone product  - glad  I stuck with you  -<br />The Up  is an improvement over the bracelet -  I kept losing the cap and  had  to keep a charger at home, in the car and at work.<br />I did not mean to go on and on.  BUT- the Smart Coach ... thumbs up  R&D  I.T.  people  -  like having my own personal coach .<br />Thank you and Regards,"
I love this case!!!!
"The cover itself is still holding together.  However, the camo image started wearing off immediately, just by putting it in his pocket. I took maybe a month or so before it was unrecognizable. It is now just silver."
As advertised
Excellent
"I purchased this at a discounted price, during a promotion, for my honest and unbiased opinion. I got this for my daughter as a joke. She loved it so much but doesn't keep it on her phone all the time. Her job wouldn't be to pleased to see the language on the case. However, she does put it on when she's out and about. The iPhone 6 Case fits perfect and easy to put on and take off. My daughter is obsessed with phone cases, she has one to match all her outfits, mood or purse. So having this one that's fun is perfect for her because she can take it off easily. It doesn't crack like some of the other cases she has. So when she is in a kidding mood she puts this one on, plus black matches everything. I recommend this iPhone 6 Case from YouVogue"
"This kit has everything you need to turn your phone into an adventure cam for your next outing. It has accessories to attach it just about anywhere on you or your vehicle, and is rugged enough to keep your phone as safe as possible.  I definitely recommend this wholeheartedly.  In the interest of full disclosure, I did receive a promotional discount on this product in order to test it and give my honest opinion of it, which I have done."
This case is amazing! It has everything they said it would and works perfectly. The tempered glass is really easy to put on and even has a kit to clean your phone before you put it on.<br />The only thing I didnt like was that I was thinking that it came with a camera hood but I even stuck my finger through were the camera is and still nothing to enhance your photos. But other than that the case is flawless
"If I could, I will give it 0 star. I bought 2 days ago and was very happy to receive today. But when I opened it and found it was made in 2013. After installation, the battery was 34% full, 30 minutes later, it became 14% full. Then I used IbackupBot to check and found the battery already has 508 count cycles.  I can accept I bought a brand new defect product, but I can not accept I bought a used product when it was claimed &#34;brand new&#34;."
Great
I love this color and the brushed metal feel. However I found that it seemed to block my streetpass abilities somewhat.
"Sound great.<br />Bluetooth connection can sometimes be problematic.<br />Charging connector is terrible, so whether or not it will charge when you plug it in is a roll of the dice.<br />Without power, these are pretty much worthless."
"would be nice if there was a secure loop to run a strap through, however the quality is good and the fit is snug."
Works as expected.  Charges my phone better than the stock Samsung cable.
"great phone when it first came out, now with all the updates, the phone was very sluggish, and i say was because the phone is no longer working from water damage, fair WARNING to the potential buyers, the phone claims to be water resistant, dont believe the hype, keep the phone away from water, i sent mine in for lcd screen dying, and the was denied for water damage, i took the phone apart when they sent it back and none of the water indicators had been triggered, either behind the battery or hidden inside the phone, but there was severe corrosion on the lcd screen, in other words keep the phone away from water dosent take much and the phone will die."
A++++++
"Bluetooth keeps disconnecting,"
works great on my new phone
"Nicely made product, but a little small on the arm for my liking."
This is very nice phone.  Works well and the price for a new one was very attractive
My wife likes this product a lot so far it has been perfectly protected! I would buy another one for a different phone version.
Wasn't worth it.
Easy to apply.
perfect fit for my blackberry and is not bulky
love them so much I ordered a second set!
DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF S***! THE BUTTON DOES NOT WORK ! (they have to be paying those people for good feed back) WARNING DO NOT BUY!  AFTER TAKING ONE PICTURE THE BUTTON STOPPED WORKING !
Love it! Great fit -a gel case not a plastic case like I thought.
It seems to be good.
"Was VERY excited to receive this. I thought it was perfect for my son's scooter. Alarm system works like a charm. I activated a new line with AT&T and installed the iPhone 4 SIM card as instructed (I think. The lights blink slowly, but the off switch doesn't turn the unit off. Have to reset it for them to turn off.) I downloaded the app. I am able to locate the scooter thru real-time tracking, but the device shows as offline. Can't get it to respond to text messages and can't setup the sos phone number. :( My son is disabled and needs this scooter for college. Can't afford another one if it's stolen so I need this working. 1 star until it works."
"This works well.  My Ipad responds quickly.  Arrived as expected, and I'm happy with it."
"Great case, protects BB Classic and not too large."
Happy with
50-50. One Doesn't charge my iPad mini from the wall charger.
I was very happy with my purchases! !
"It is very easy to install, and so far so good.  Holds the phone perfectly (Note2). No issues at all, and got exactly what I expected. Very solid piece of equipment."
Cheaply made... fragile not study.<br />You get what you pay for. Not recommended.....
Great but really hard to remove
"This product is not Apple certified! It does not work with any of my devices.. iPhone 6, 5 and iPad Air 2"
"I wanted to move a step up from the typical Skullcandy and Apple buds I'd been using. I've of loved what I,be had but was eager to see what the next tier up was like and I was soooo not disappointed...<br /><br />Look and Feel<br />The first thing you notice about the Symphonized NRG  2.0 earphones is how attractive they are. I got the dark brown finish with black and simply put they,re quite handsome and unique. The second thing I noticed was the quality of the cable. My previous experiences have been with very flexible, but somewhat flimsy cabling which has a propensity to turn into a rat's nest when stowed. These come out of the backpack pocket barely jumbled at worst. No frothy cable knots to gently subdue.<br /><br />Sound Quality<br />And then I put them on and played some music. While they are billed as noise-isolating, and I've never used noise-canceling so excuse my naïvet&eacute;, but I 'be apparently missed people speaking to me and as much as I hate being rude, these seem to really minimize ambient noise. The base range is much more pronounced and I've stopped equalizing to compensate for the earphone's profile. I will add that I have to listen with the volume ~30% lower with the NRG buds as they seem to produce a lot more sound for the same volume level, and they sound amazing.<br /><br />Telephony<br />I replaced a beloved pair of Skullcandy earbuds because I had conducted so many phone calls with them I literally frayed and unglued every rubber connection on them and they were quite threadbare in appearance. The same places I grab to insert/remove the buds is one solid piece of wood, which won't therefore fall apart from wear. And everyone had complimented how crystal clear I sounded in the old pair so I was concerned about microphone quality. I'm pleased to report that 100% of my audience indicated the quality had actually improved...hurray!<br /><br />Leakage<br />And, before donning them, I'm surprised they're even on because they don't leak, meaning adjacent cubicle workers aren't stuck listening to what I am. While the Skullcandy buds were discrete, I was always concerned They might be audible and therefore distracting to those nearby. Not a concern with the Symphonized NRG buds.<br /><br />Summary<br />I am not an audiophile and realize I don't know a great deal about &#34;high fidelity&#34; audio. I also acknowledge that I have probably damaged my ears with inferior products over the years (not the Apple or Skullcandy, but those horrible orange sponge Walkman headphones back in the eighties. That said I am very satisfied with this step up in design, look, feel, quality, and the discretion afforded by these and highly recommend them for individuals looking for the next level up. If this is a compromise, I'm in sound heaven!jacent cubicle workers aren't stuck listening to what I am.

It was great! My teenager loved it !
"Perfect solution to hold my iPhone 6 Plus with case in my 2014 Hyundai Tucson. Sturdy, too."
Great quality for price
"good grip, not too bulky, nice looking"
"Gives new life to my Bose 30pin docking station for my Bose radio.  I plug in the Coolstream, sync to my phone and streaming begins.  Very easy.  The only thing I'd like is an on/off switch.  Once it's plugged in the bluetooth light is always on so I have to remove it from the dock when done.  Not a big deal but I'd rather have a way to switch it off.  Great little product and does it's job really well - do not hesitate to buy."
excellent! Thank you
The case works fine and seems to be very durable
"It was a good idea, but I was never able keep the screen protector on. Brushing up against something would remove it."
It does chip and crack the edges pretty easily but my phone has fallen flat on its face many times and the protector hasnt fully cracked. This is my second one because the first one died protecting my phone's screen during a nasty fall. This is smooth and i feel no difference between this and the actual phone glass.
"I received this unit as ordered and on time, with all parts accounted for.  It came charged ~75% and quickly reached 100% within 1-2 hours of plugging in.  I used it to charge up my HTC (2100 mAh) which was down to 37%, and it recharged it to 100% within one hour.  The 8400 was small and easily packable.  I bought it because of the good reviews given by other users and do not expect it to disappoint. ."
This item works great I highly recommend.
Won't stay clipped on the vent. Dislike
the belt clip broke in less then ten hours on my belt
"I received a good product, I recommend it for novice users who want to start with smart phones."
works great on Windows 10.
I love it!
Fast shipping. Easy install. Works perfectly fine.
"These are awesome headphones!  This is the first time I've ever used wireless/bluetooth headphones and I love them!  They are so convenient!!<br /><br />***FUNCTIONS***<br />- Pair with multiple devices<br />- Cancel, answer, reject, and end calls<br />- Redial the last number<br />- Call transfer (headset to phone) & Call transfer (phone to headset)<br />- Microphone mute & Cancel mute<br />- Volume +/-<br />- Skip to next or go back to previous songs<br />- Play/pause<br /><br />***PROS***<br />- My iPhone and Macbook found the headphones very easily and paired with them in seconds.<br />- They charged in about 10-15 min.  The instructions say that they take 1.5 hours to fully charge, but the first time I plugged them in to charge them right out of the box they were charged in about 10 minutes when I plugged them into my laptop which itself was not plugged into it's power source and these still were able to charge quickly.  Though the light turns blue when they are fully charged, whereas the instructions say the red light goes off - technically yes the red light goes off but there is a blue light that indicates when they are fully charged.<br />- There is a computerized female voice that says &#34;Power On&#34;, &#34;Power Off&#34;, &#34;Low Battery&#34; etc.  That's all I've heard her say so far, but I'm not sure what else is in her vocabulary.<br />- They will power off automatically if they aren't being used for about 10 min.  I was watching a movie computer with them and I paused my movie and walked away to do some things but kept the headphones in my ears and after about 10 minutes the voice said &#34;Power off&#34;.  But I just clicked the power button when I got back to my computer and it played no problem (I didn't have to pair them again).<br />- Great for working out because you never have to worry about the cord and if you're using your phone you can have it across the room, you don't have to carry it or keep it on you the whole time.<br /><br />***CONS***<br />- The volume buttons are conveniently on one of the ear pieces but the up and down ends of the volume buttons aren't as prominent to the touch (aren't as elevated for you to feel with your fingertip) as I would expect. Perhaps I'm just still getting used to them, but I occasionally have turned up the volume when I wanted to turn down because I can't feel the + and - very well, but remembering the + is at the top helps.<br />- Because these are wireless and have lots of features/capabilities like answering the phone and they have to pair with your devices etc. It is worth reading the instructions (which I normally wouldn't do with just a pair of headphones), but these have lots of capabilities so it is worth it to read the instructions so you can remember which buttons to press and how long to press them for to have the headphones do all the functions you want them to do.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these headphones, I am very pleased with them.<br /><br />_________________<br />Made by: TOSHENG<br />ASIN: B012QTR0AA<br />Product provided for review by: TOSHENG<br />Shipped by: Amazon LLCof the volume buttons aren't as prominent to the touch (aren't as elevated for you to feel with your fingertip) as I would expect.

Fits perfect....just hard to put it on
"This is not an otterbox. This is otterbox lite at best. The belt clip is useless, you have to put it is screen down. Which means when you need to use the phone you have to take it out of the clip entirely, and it is a very tight fit. too tight. the case very much so does interfere with my screen protector. why did I get a stylus? Its a galaxy note. On the plus side the kickstand is kickass and it is considerably thin. would give 5 stars if the belt clip worked better."
it work very well for all my needs
"This is a fantastic screen protector for my Galaxy S4! The screen broke on my phone a couple of weeks ago which made my old screen protector start to peel up from all the glass. So I took the old protector off, cleaned up the glass a little, and bought this new protector to put back on over the break. This screen protector comes with everything you need to get the protector sealed perfectly to your phone. It has the screen wipes, anti static clean sheets, etc. All the prep materials worked perfectly to clean and clear up my screen to get it ready for the protector. The protector was very easy to apply, and I love how I just had to set it in place and it attached quickly on it's own leaving only a few areas for me to smooth down. There isn't a perfect seal around the part of my screen that's the most damaged, but I wouldn't expect there to be, and it is staying on much better than my old one was. I love how thick the screen protector is as well! It's really a great quality screen protector and I am very happy with it. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
Awesome case for the price!
"I was skeptical, but this protector is like it's not even there.  Clear as can be.  I much prefer it to the previous invisible shields I have used in the past that were just the film as those seemed to dull the display a bit..this leaves the view crystal clear."
Very fun. Needs more foam around the nose and sides for it to be wearable for a long time.
"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
This is not what I wanted ! I wanted a glass protector and not a plastic one. I'm very disappointed.
Just what I needed
very good
Fastest charger I've ever had
"looks ok except for the letters on the back , they should leave the back blank without the white writing it spoils the case"
"So, I admit to being a cell phone case junkie.  I probably have a dozen in my &#34;tech&#34; drawer for my iPhone 6 Plus.  But when I saw the Dreem case I was intrigued.  I waited several days of normal use to write my opinion and I can now safely say that this case really is a &#34;dream&#34;.  The folio is beautifully made and flexible enough to hold a variety of cards and cash.  Magnets work flawlessly and I feel very secure carrying this beautiful case with me everywhere.  But the icing on this cake is the second part of the case.  When necessary I can remove the phone from the folio and still have a beautiful and protective case on my phone.  The front lip protects my glass of my screen and the integrated magnets hold my phone securely on the iSwivel vent mount I have installed in my car.  I hit the jackpot!!<br /><br />I also forgot to mention another surprise I got when I received the Dreem Fibonacci case.  The packaging was so elegant I though I had received an Apple product.  Every detail was well thought out and elegant.  Their attention to detail from packaging to product makes this a go-to product."
"Installation was easy, with clear instructions, cleaning cloth and alcohol swabs provided with the screen.<br />My phone's original screen was prone to finger prints and smudges and was difficult to clean.<br />With this glass screen protector, no more smudges and easy to clean."
Very nice i iwll buy it again.
"Use it every day, totally great"
"Bought this product because my battery wasn't holding charge as long and was taking longer to charge. Was told this was a new, original battery. Did as instructed in letting the battery go totally out and recharge.  Within a couple of weeks it wasn't holding a charge very well and at one point it was taking all into the evening after work, while I was asleep and had to have it plugged in at work all day into the evening and was only charged at 59%.  Don't waste your time or money.  Did return it since it was covered under Amazon's return policy."
Great shields. No glare on my phone. Lasts for a good while.
Working  great I would recommend this product
good Batt!
I have purchased 2 of them already and the clip keeps breaking after a couple of weeks.
This stick is the best one I've seen by far.  It's so easy to use and extremely versatile in terms of the types of equipment you can use it with.  The materials and construction are solid.  We are taking this with us on our trip to Greece later this week so I will report back later.  One more thing...the company has done an outstanding job of following up to make sure we are happy with the product.  Great customer service so far.
This is an adorable phone cover. It arrived in a very timely manner and I am impressed with the quality of the product.
Does the job of protecting my phone.
Are not remove easily
I love this case!
Its fine
Good unit foe my boat but distorts at high volume good at mid to upper volumes
It works well but it is made rather cheaply and the front plastic clear cap falls of a lot also there is not much space between the two ports making a little difficult to plug in two devices at a time but other then that I loved the product.
"I bought this phone about a year and a half ago and am very pleased with it. It's a very sturdy phone and has withstood countless falls without a case, including falls on asphalt and down a hill. When it drops the back cover of the phone comes off and the battery falls out, but I simply put the battery back in and clip the back on. The screen has never even cracked. It continues to work like always; I don't even worry when I drop my phone without it's case anymore. Also, I brought it kayaking with me once and stuck it in the waterproof compartment, but it got a little wet anyhow. When I opened the phone the inside was quite wet, so I quickly took out the battery, dried it off, blew in the cracks, and set it in front of a fan. It was fine!   Besides durability, this phone is very good looking, especially in white. The white shows dirt faster, but this is very easy to remedy, just unclip the back of the phone and wash it with soap and warm water. DO NOT get the battery or phone wet! This phone can't have many apps at once, maybe five, depending how big they are. But it has a removable mini SD card, which is very nice. And it works well for Bluetooth, texting, talking, WiFi, and everything you'll need on a phone. The camera is pretty good too. Plus it's inexpensive, not to mention it has triple minutes, a big money-saver! VERY nice phone. I love this phone ! !"
I now have two of these switches. Easy to install and the app is great.  I love the integration with ifttt.  I schedule the front porch light to automatically turn on at sundown and turn off two hours later.  Great smart switch!
"This is my second Microsoft Lumia phone. The XL is so much easier to read and I love the Dual Sim. This way I don't need another cell phone when travelling to Germany. The only drawback I see is that the android phones have so many more apps available. I miss playing Scrabble on the Microsoft phone, a great way to pass the time at airports or in doctor's offices. I do like the fact that the Microsoft phone was much more affordable than the Android phones I was considering. All in all I am happy with my purchase."
I would not buy this again.  It's cheap enough. But you get what you pay for. I have an i-phone 4 (the little one) and this does not hold it correctly. It now holds my post it notes on my desk because it cannot hold anything heavier. The only reason I gave it a 2 stars is because it's cheap enough
all in all works well. Sometimes clarity is a problem but for the most part it works well
Completely wrong case
Really liked the durability of this product feels sturdy and strong.  But sound on speaker phone and direct talk was difficult.  No one could hear me. Complained that I sounded like I was in a cave.  Bought for Disney trip. Served it's purpose.
good material
"if you are looking for a great screen protector to help keep  damaging marks and accidents on your childs favorite Nabi Big Tab, then this product is NOT IT.  I have bought many different screen protectors for different applications and devices from a variety of manufacturers over the years. some were oaky, some were good, some were awesome. this one didn't make the list.<br />I researched the product before buying, to study up on the application, the durability, and the reviews. while this product makes sense in some on some devices because of the sizes and mediocre quality, this is in no way made for the protection on investment of my Nabi Big Tab. the application process just does not work for the 20&#34; inch screen size. 4  units came with my order and i gave up after the third attempt. the manufacturer should redesign a new material and process for large applications because working on anything bigger than a 10&#34; tablet just doesn't make sense for this material. the seller was a good choice as the shipping was fast, but this product just failed miserably."
This thing is a must for a motorcycle!
Work great...inexpensive and seem to hold a charge very well.
"Just received my first two, one is going as a gift.<br />Pro's-<br />1. Charged 4 phone pretty fast & still had 72% battery charge left<br />2. Hast a great tight carry pouch for both battery & cables.<br /><br />Semi Con-<br />1. Huge almost like an iPad mini.<br /><br />But for travel and day to day use so far seems awesome, will update review in a few weeks again."
👍🏼
Great deal for the price
Seems to work fine.  It does charge phones and my tablet faster than the 1 and 2 amp chargers I have.
Great!
Love it
"Horrible.  The distance between the earpeice and mouth peice is the distance from my ear to almost my belly button. If I somehow attach the mouth peice to my shirt collar (with a pin), then there isn't enough length to reach the walkie talkie (on my hip).  Unfortunately I waited too long to file a return now stuch with this peice which would only fit some mutant species that has a huge distance between their ear and mouth and have their wasit a mere inches from their mouth.  Not sure how this design got past any human that tried the product on themselves."
great one i like it
Good product.
Love wearing them around the house while I work or while I mow the yards!
This is the first review I have ever written. I ordered the 2 pack of cables to charge my iphone 6. It arrived with only 1 cable and it didn't even work. Tried 2 different wall adapters and nothing. Do not order from this seller.
Great product.
Hi purchase one and had to return it because one of the headset when out I got the replacement when using my cell phone the sound goes in and out not too happy with this product
I had them a month and they both quit working:(
wish you make it a little wider so the otterbox can go in it
It was so bad that it's hilarious! I got two completely different watches! Tried to get a refund and it did not even happen. Such a waste!!
Ordered this in hopes to be able to have my phone in a spot that I could easily see where I was going if using maps. I was worried about a good fit because I currently own a Note 4 but it does fit in nicely.<br /><br />It is a suction cup mount which I was hesitant about but as long as the area you place it on is clean it actually stays in place. I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review and all views expressed are mine. That being said I am definitely satisfied with this item and belive it works very well.
Not good at all. Looked used and didn't even work? Do not buy.
Ugly color of dingy brown and offers little protection.  Would return it if it weren't such a hassle to do so.
"Overall it is very good, but the plastic kickstand broke almost immediately."
As advertised.
"I am not a fan of this product for the following reasons, and each one would keep me from recommending this product to anyone.<br />1) The plug fits very loose in the power port in my car and it slides out<br />2) Cannot use all 3 charging cords together.<br />3) Using only the micro USB on my Samsung Galaxy S4 would not charge it fast enough to use the GPS while charging a battery that was low on charge.<br />This is a complete waste of $20"
"Thanks, can't wait to try them!"
"I had a previous version of this radar detector and loved it. The only issue was that there were many times that it would receive a radar signal from a car passing by with collision avoidance system. This product has an updated system with a lesser amount of nuisance alerts and 90% of the time, there is actually a cop detecting radar when the alert sounds."
Looks good and the reception is significantly better than the original stubby antenna.  No longer hitting every cement beam at work or the airport parking garages with the factory antenna.
"It is an excellent replacement for the one that came originally with my VIPER 5902 security system, which was fading out and the key ring fell off.<br />I've only had it for a couple of months, so it is too soon to know if this one will fade out too."
"Nice battery, but I'm returning it because the product dimensions are incorrectly listed (as of 8/31/15). It is listed as being the same size as the Astro E5 2nd Gen, but it is significantly longer than the E5. The upgraded matte finish is cool but it's more slippery than the piano finish on the E5. It doesn't have a flashlight like the E5 and the battery lights don't stay on very long when you check the battery strength, whereas on the E5 the battery meter would remain lit up for about 30 seconds."
god job
"I've had this product almost three months, only one of my four chargers works. I'm very disappointed. I thought I would be getting a quality product that would last me at least a year. The chords themselves last a few weeks a piece and I had to rotate them out. I use them on both my iPhone 5 and my iPad. However, when hey did work, I was pleased."
This case is great
I have tried this on three different vehicles and it did not work on any of them.  It doesn't fit in the vents properly and the weight of the phone constantly pulls it to a downward viewing angle.  Can't recommend this product at all.
Had this for a couple months and now doesn't work . Don't buy these cheap car chargers
Got these for my wife because I liked the blue pair a lot. She likes them but hardly wears them because she uses her iPad speaker more often to listen to music out loud.
Fits good
Fits perfectly and I love that I could find a clear one so I can see the color of my Ipod.
A joke  melt me a product that have been returned it was broken the belt clip was broken and the case was cracked I'm pissed
"After years of trying to buy a disc Stylus that worked alongside my difficulty handling a pen properly, (I did fail handwriting throughout elementary school), I've found these extremely helpful in helping me to be able to read my own digital handwriting."
great look and fits well.
Looks nothing like the picture at all! The case BROKE as soon as I put it on my phone!
Good quality
Had two of the lime green color stands sent to me that had manufacturer defects. JETech has been great about making sure I was satisfied and sent me the updated version and it works great. The craftsmanship of the updated version is miles ahead of the old version.
Love the great price!
Perfect fit.  Loved the variety of colors to chose from !
Already blown after Two days!!!!
Works well.  We take it camping and it gets us through a few days
"Decent case, very cheap.  Only downside is that the picture is misleading.  Lots of people poke fun at me because of it.  I don't care because I have a good come back and am usually clowning around anyhow.  The pic doesn't show that it has little nodes all over it.  The nodes keep the phone from touching the case.  When I say nodes...I'm talking LOTS of them and they are very apparent.  Usually someone tells me I have a girl phone case and I just tell them they are just jealous their phone case doesn't have nipples all over it.  Please see the pic."
Its okay ..
Slow shipping but overall good product!
"Very fancy, has endured quite a bit so far.  Pleased with the product."
Works beautifully with my iPad and also my iPhone
For me daughter.  She loves it.
I bought this in order to arrange the cables in the office. Solid performance. Exterior finish was great. I want to buy one more for my family.
great
"I bought two but cut off, very bad"
Thank you.
great product
"This is a great little product. I also bought 3 cables when I purchased this charger, and I can charge my phone, backup battery, and bluetooth all at the same time. It's actually remarkably quick too. During my half hour commute, I can get a full charge on my bluetooth, 1/3 of a charge on my backup battery, and 3/4 of a charge on my phone, a Samsung Galaxy S4. Definitely recommend it. Great product, especially for the price."
I love this case. It is a very light case but protects the borders of the phone. Very happy here
"I purchased the Snapfon ezTWO phone for my 84 year old Mother who has lost most of her vision from macular degeneration.  I wanted her to be able to get to her 3 kids on &#34;speed dial&#34; from her rehab facility and the audio feature is perfect for this purpose.  To call me she presses &#34;2&#34; on the nice big buttons and the phone says aloud &#34;two&#34; and then speed dials my number.  I got it for a great price ($79) and it arrived promptly and in good condition.<br /><br />There are two reasons for not giving this phone a full 5 stars:<br /><br />1.  Setting up speed dial was not straightforward.  The directions did not explain how to set up speed dial and Google was not immediately helpful.  It took me an hour but I finally did find the instructions on Google - the speed dial feature is located in &#34;settings&#34; and after I found it the rest was straightforward.<br /><br />2.  I've only had one conversation with Mom on this phone (it with me as the caller, making a test call) and although I heard her loud and clear (the volume is also excellent for folks with hearing loss), she kept saying, &#34;Your voice keeps cutting out.&#34;  I'll need to test this out a bit more.  I've got the phone all set up now and am about to send it to her in the rehab hospital where she will be for about 2 more months.<br /><br />Other phones with similar features cost up to $900! I found 1 phone with similar features at $59 but it didn't have very good reviews.  So far I am very pleased with this purchase.  I went to AT&T and got a $30/mo no contract plan and am happy with that too."
Great product. Fast shipping too.
"It's good and look nice. It fits well too, but cards slots are already cracked or ripped off and in fact that not much card on it."
"Poor quality compared to the real fitbit bands. It looks like a great value, but they all suck, also the metal part they provide is worthless."
I love this case.  I followed the instructions and tested the case prior to using.  It's great for stand-up paddle boarding and I appreciate all the color options!
We have tried all of the cords in the pack.  They seem to work a couple of times and then they don't charge any longer. Really disappointed!
Awesome case low profile not bulky I ordered it in red and love it. I will be ordering it again in other colors! Great buy!!!
This was so inexpensive and is much better than any expensive one we ever used.  I highly recommend this item.
Just got it in the mail put it on and it was very easy there is no lag when touching the screen mand it works well with the otter box commuter series. Recommend buy
Works great!  I'm using it with an iPhone 6 and Nexus 6 along with Nokia HERE and Gaia maps.
easy to apply and worked well
The white portions of this discolored significantly in a short period of time and no cleanser I have tried would restore its whiteness. It now resides in the garbage.
Works like it supposed to. Good quality!
Excellent
My phone case is perfect and arrived on time. GREAT product.
"Ringke products are good quality and I read a lot of reviews about the Slim. I was worried it might be too light to protect my S6 Edge Plus but it actually works. I accidentally dropped it out of my pocket outside but the way it fell and landed my phone was fine. I’d say if you want a case for good protection and keeps how your phone feels naturally, go for this Ringke Slim case."
Very comparable to big name products.
Love the case
Best case available IMHO.
"Looks super cheap, and doesn't protect the phone. You get what you pay for."
Let me start out by saying that I drive a tractor trailer and deliver freight for a living.I've had other Nite Ize cases in the past and loved them but this is the biggest case so far.It lasted a year in a half before becoming unusable but then it was a big case that was constantly being subjected to rubbing the trailer walls as I was trying to get pallets off a trailer so I really can't say anything bad about it.By the way I still have a small Nite Ize case that's still going strong after 5 years.
Got these for my daughter to use at school in the computer lab. The sound quality is perfectly balanced. They store easily in a small plastic bag. They are easily wiped down with an electronic wipe.
Did not fit my HTC 8xt phone  :[
"With the white bumper around the phone, my headphone and charger port was blocked. It's really hard to put on and take off, so after a week I kept the bumper off. The phone still felt quite protected, and there's been several times my phone fell and this seemed to help protecting my phone.<br />The case discolors very quickly. I purchased this in late June 2015, and now 2 months later, it is faded and very dirty looking.<br />I can't be too upset on the discoloration based on the affordable price of this case, but I am upset to see how part of the case makes the most important parts of the phone inaccessible."
Unit failed after 13 months of very light use.  The output side does not supply enough voltage/current.  Devices connect to it will not charge showing the X sign over the battery icon.
"Adorable. My son bought this. It is so cute. However, since purchasing it a girl borrowed it and we haven;t seen it since. Ha, I guess she thought it was cute too."
Very nice soundbot
"Much larger than I expected and won't seem to charge a device while it's charging for some reason, however a previous model would.As for working on the go like previous models it's amazing. I would suggest including either the mini usb to iphone adapter or that cable as well.I know other vendors include a duo cable.The bag was really cool, it's over sized so you can fit an extra charger, usb wall charger and my phone with extra room. I would have given 5 stars but I think the not charging issue while plugged in and not including the iphone adapter or duo cable makes this product great but not quite perfect.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Eric"
"These headphones are the best I have ever purchased and probably the most affordable. They sit so comfortably and there is no movement from the headphone. Yes, i swear they stay exactly how you put them in. The cord does not have that pulling motion that yanks the headphones out of the ear ear while your arms are pumping. The sound is great I am not a sound engineer, but there is a perfect blend in bass and treble. I love that I can adjust the volume from the ear piece and change songs. I love that it is Bluetooth. I now can take my phone and use Spotify for my runs and have my phone in my hydration pack instead of on my arm."
"Installed this unit in my 2005 Ford Mustang replacing stock Shaker 500 system.  Am quite satisfied with the performance and features of the unit for the price.  I added the Sirius XM tuner which plugs directly into the Jensen unit - no fuss here.  Overall, the Jensen vx7020 is a nice technology upgrade and an easy way to modernize my 10-year old car.  Used the recommended Metra wiring harness, mounting kit and 12v-to-5v power filter.  As others mentioned, the mounting kit did NOT include screws, so I had to scrounge the garage for self tapping short screws to make that work.  Backup camera for $15 is the real treat here!  The unit supports backup camera display when car is shifted into reverse.  This was worth the effort to upgrade and install alone.  It does not have backup sensors to warn of approaching objects, but the visual is a great and frankly unexpected addition."
"A good case, but if you put 5 or more bills in the bill pocket it gets hard to close."
Stop working after a month don't get
work great
works as advertised.
Very Good!!
Great protection at a great price.
"The battery arrived quickly.  Turns out the phone I bought the battery for was totally broken, so I bought another G'zOne, same model  the battery works, but it is thicker than the original one.  I can not use my charging station, or belt clip with it.  I can still charge it with the direct plug in wire.  It was very reasonably priced and had free shipping!  I will keep it for electric outages or when I go camping.  Please note these phones are not Labrador Retriever proof!"
So cool
Excellent product. i recommend to buy.... nice look and tough too
Works well overall. I have used this item on a couble of rides for about a week. The only reservation I have is the red Web type rubber piece that holds the phone. Seems if it were to stretch or break the mount would no longer be<br />usable.<br /><br />This concern might not be warranted. Only time will tell.
It's fit perfectly.
Love it
Works like a champ.
Only thing when you remove it from car to another car the sticky part doesn't work
The case itself holds up fine but the graphic on the back is a sticker with poor adhesive.  I've had it on my phone for a week and the sticker is already coming off.  This is a poor case and I'm disappointed that I bought it.
Very good design and much cheaper than you can find in Apple Store.
case fit perfectly with galaxy note 5 and it sparkles. Yeeeessss Hunty!.
"Love it! Came quickly, fits my Note 4 perfectly and looks great!"
"Awesome phone stand.  Just what I was looking for.  Don't hesitate, buy it."
They do not work with our phones as soon as you plug them in you get an error notice on the phone or they charge for a few minutes and then the error appears. Spend the extra money and but the apple product or they will not work properly.
Worked at first but then wouldn't charge my phone anymore. Not a good product at all. I'm very dissatisfied.
"The screen was locked at first, but Samsung helped with a factory reset.  After that, the watch exceeded expectations.  A great entry into the smart watch market."
Love the waterproof design and the capacity of this case bag. It can be used during beach day or for travel. Nice case.
Would be nice if the glass was a bit bigger. This glass seems to attract fingerprints. Was an easy install...
"Very happy with these, especially for the price. I purchased them to wear while doing tasks in the yard or in the workshop. Sound quality is surprisingly good for a pair of cheap headphones. Works very well with my Note 4"
"Worked for 2 charges, stopped working.  Very dissapointed"
The case itself is fine and it is convenient to have the stand also. But the screen protector shipped with it is quite useless in my opinion. It only covers part of the screen which is very inconvenient especially for texting.
Lots of room for your complete GPS. Highly recommend it.
"Worst headphones ever.<br /><br />They skip music all the time: while walking, while pulling your phone from your pocket, while sitting down, while standing up, while turning. You get the picture. No sudden movements, or the audio skips.<br /><br />Terrible: after just 3 uses, the USB-power side cable removed itself from the unit - see photo.<br /><br />And what's weird and unexplainable: these headphones randomly click buttons on my Android smarthphone, and send map location data to unknown Google Hangouts recipients - also see photo. I mean, I could click the &#34;power&#34; button on the device and it would send random interactions to the phone, like clicking ads in Spotify or opening Maps. Not cool.<br /><br />I'm returning."
Good quality product.Nice color.
Terrible. The &#34;carbon fiber&#34; chipped off the first day and looked terrible
great
I love it!!
Excellent batteries!
great item
Works good on my iPhone 5 S...you must clean the screen first before applying or else it won't do you any good. I would buy it again...
"Everything fine, nice & useful as expected & good delivery service..."
I took forever for me to receive it and it turned out to be broken
"I am amazed. This cord is perfect. First, the length. I am able to use my device in bed, use it on the couch in any comfortable position, and best of all charge my device without any faulty wiring.   The cord (10 ft) I bought is beautiful. It is nearly identical to the shipped 30-pin cords that come with iDevices. The connection from the charging end to the port on my device is firm and fixated yet not so much that its a struggle to unplug. Storage is nice because the cord coils up into a nice circle, making a comfortable width of about a soda can.  The best part of this buy is that the price was around ten dollars (including shipping). TEN DOLLARS. The quality of this accessory is so akin to the stock cords that I can hardly believe it. I will absolutely be buying more.  UPDATE: It's been about one month. The cord has ceased to charge my device. I had to buy yet another 30-pin cord. I'm asking for a refund."
Works as described!
Protects screen very well!
Very bad quality. It broke very easily because the extension was glued on. I would not recommend this product.
"For one who's always nervous about my ability to completely remove the dust particles and push out the bubbles between any kind of glass surface protector, applying this tempered glass made me feel like a pro! The application videos are incredibly helpful, and the tempered glass comes with a clearly labeled 3 step application kit that makes everything very simple. And it looks AMAZING when complete! I'm a fan!"
This product works well.  It is challenging to find a good protective case for the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge due to the increased thickness of the phone after installing the Charging Qi Cover.
I've had this Tuff case for a week now and Love it. It comes in different color variations which is nice. Seems sturdy. Good grip. And I like how the corners don't have the hard gel case. IMO less likely to break as fast.
Case does not fit my 5s properly on the sides and credit card does not fit either.<br />Returning this immediately.<br />Would not recommend.
This was one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon to date! This charging case took my original factory battery and turned my phone into a super charged phone. I have been able to go over 24 hours without having to charge my phone!! I am a heavy user as I use my phone for work and personal and tend to use my phone to play music in my car as well as when I am working out. Love this case!! Only compliant is it could use more protection on the top and bottom of the case; perhaps a rubber outlining to provide more protection.
"In direct sunlight, the 8W version allowed my phone's battery to gain charge while streaming 4G video with the screen at full brightness. What more could you ask for?"
"It doesn't work; , returning it"
It fit my Note 5 like it was suppose to. It's a great  product!!
I don't know how they can claim this is water proof. I wore it in the shower by accident once and now it doesn't work anymore.  Update: after letting it dry out for two days it finally works again but I will never ever trust getting it wet even washing my hands or in the shower and unfortunately I will definitely never try to swim with it on.
This is the best phone case I have ever had.  I am a very clumsy person. I would say I drop my phone on average at least 4 times per week. I have dropped my phone where it has actually bounced off the side of a table and then hit the floor and my phone still worked. I have also dropped my phone in a puddle of water and my phone was fine. While I don't suggest trying this at home I would suggest this for any other clumsy person out there. For this price you can't go wrong and it's not bulky like some others out there.
This adapter barely works.  Only about 25% of the song comes through.  I had to buy three more before getting one that worked.
This is the most easiest screen protector ever to apply. No bubbles at all! Just place it in your clean phone and that's it! The clarity is so clear that you cant even tell its on. It hasn't scratched at all and is very durable. Great product and great price!
Does all that it is suppose to do.
Worth every penny and it is beautiful. Only thing that would make it better is to have more color choices.
no problems<br />arrived sooner than expected
This case is actually true to the picture and is very cute 😃 one thing I really don't like is the ears
Fits perfectly on the phone. All the slots for various ports are perfectly aligned.
"Having the right amount of battery power is a constant essential for video shoots but with various camera, monitor and lighting systems it's sometimes best to bring a power solution that can work across multiple devices. The Kayo Maxtar 12V is a portable and powerful battery that's a great addition for your shooting kit.<br /><br />The Kayo Maxtar 12V comes in a compact, hardshell zipper carrying case and has a rectangular design with a red and black colorway and glossy plastic finish. It's lightweight with a minimalist feel. Although the Maxtar is meant to be stationary, it would have been great to have a 1/4-20 thread to mount it on to a small tripod or shoulder rig.<br /><br />On the top is a high powered LED light which has 3 modes (flash, strobe and SOS) which lasts over 120 hours. While it's not a crucial feature, it's nice to have a flashlight handy during a night shoot.<br /><br />A closer look at the accessories reveal a power charger, car charger, jumper cables, and various power connectors. One caveat is that the power cord for the connectors is short which means any device that you are powering must be stationed very close to the Maxtar.<br /><br />Nothing can ruin a good shoot than backup battery power that can't keep up with your usage. Thankfully, the Kayo Maxtar 12V is capable of multiple charges. It's high capacity cells can fully charge an iPhone 6 at least 4 times, a Samsung S5 about 3 times, an HTC One about 3 times and a Mini iPad about 2 times.<br /><br />The dual 20V 3.5A and 12V 2.5A is also a nice touch which is ideal for powering up small devices like an LED light or external monitor. Again, it would have been nice if there was a mounting solution for the Maxtar but some industrial velcro straps or zip ties should do the trick.<br /><br />Another interesting feature are the included 12V jumper cables to jump start your vehicle. While I didn't have an opportunity to test this out, it's a nice addition and much more convenient way to jump start your car instead using another vehicle.<br /><br />Overall, the Kayo Maxtar 12V is a highly affordable power bank that runs much cheaper than some other Li-Ion solutions on the market. Having this in my kit assures that I'll have power available if anything goes wrong - like an uncharged battery - which happens sometimes. Sure it's not immediately adaptable for video rigs but with some DIY techniques, it's a much cheaper alternative than standard V-Mount style batteries. The Kayo Maxtar 12V is definitely worth considering if you're looking to have an all in one battery backup solution for any situation."
"Works great! This screen protector has saved my phone multiple times, I love it!<br />I've bought two and will be buying more in the future (I tend to have butter-fingers!)"
"The texture of the case is nice and firm, a good feeling. but that&#34;s it. the case gives the phone no protection what so ever.<br />My son dropped his phone getting out of the truck, into a pebble garden. A PEBBLE GARDEN, and the screen cracked.<br />If you want this case for looks then get it. but if you want protection, find something else."
Simple black case that fits really well. I think It makes the side buttons easier to press.
"This product sucks<br /> The part that flips open so you can charge your phone is a. Hard to open the first few times as and then it breaks off. And if you accidentally drop it it's busts open. Save yourself the trouble and shell out a little extra for a real life proof. I now have my s6 sitting in rice praying that the few seconds it was in water bc of this case, does work. Very very disappointed, I never once have ever given a bad review I always find the good in a product. I just can't with this one"
It works quite well. An awesome product.
Great plug charges everything
Great fit for my samsumg note
Front stage center stereo excellent...
Really good quality for the price.
Love it !
This is the best Bluetooth I've ever bought it lasts hours and u don't even feel it
Item exactly as described and arrived on time
"I bought 3 of these because through a series of unfortunate events I lost/broke my other cables. I use one at my bedside and it works if i don't touch the phone. If I pick up the phone it starts buzzing on and off like it is dancing in my hand. The same happens with the one I use in my car. And the one I use at work. All three work most of the time, but if touch the cord any it disconnects and reconnects.... so I am just waiting for the day when these cords don't reconnect anymore..."
Poor product
I love it
So far so good.  I've had it for a few weeks and it's working great.  The case is sturdy without being bulky. I like the portal placement and functionality as well. The holster holds on tight and the swivel is really nice. My experience has been good and I recommend the product.
"I loved this particular case for the way it fit and the fact it actually feel like a case, not a piece of rubber I found in previously owned ones."
Excellent product!  Fast delivery!
Cable was a little short for what I was in need for
"I loved the quick service and the headset.  It is very comfortable to wear and easy to operate.  I haven't really had an opportunity to assess the sound quality, but will write another review to share my opinion."
"I LOVE this screen protector. I recommend buying two of them. I drop my phone a LOT and actually I'm on my second one. The one I have on my phone now has a crack all the way through it from me dropping it but it's barely noticeable so I haven't replaced it yet. I drop my phone almost once a day and it never cracks any more and my screen is still perfect. I've never had a screen last this long. The screen protector is also totally unnoticeable when it's placed correctly. It goes on easily with no bubbles, and you literally can't feel or see that it's there once it's on. I would buy this product over and over again in lieu of a phone case."
"I use this every day with my galaxy note 3, Charges it up no problem, very quick. This is a high quality product. I have used other anker products in the past, all amazing.  Never had any problems but my friends tell me that their customer service is unmatched."
I love it great
The top and bottom don't stay hooked together.
"Nice, just as described."
Didn't work for me! Received only one piece... not the three pieces shown in the picture.
Adorable way to decorate and protect your phone.
This is a great case. It fits the phone well and the magnet keeps the cover in place with no difficulty. It gives reasonable protection against a fall and keeps both sides of the phone safe from scratches. Looks nice too.
Only one worked. Only going to charge does not process data or audio.
I love this case! It is super protective and a great color and quality! Definitely recommended.
"It didn't work.  Purchased it to use with a credit card reader since my phone's case is too big for the reader to seat properly.  When I plugged it in, my phone recognized that something was in the headphone jack, but the program for using credit cards didn't recognize that it was connected.  I removed my case and tried the reader alone, and it worked just fine, but not when using the adapter."
I have the S5 apparently bought the wrong case =(
"works as advertised.  small, well-built.  sometimes i have trouble charging in the second port but if i wiggle it around it works ..the problem might be my car's cigarette lighter. overall, i am very happy though...especially for the price."
The Edge 200 works well.  I have had issues a few times getting it to find a GPS signal.  In those cases I have to power it off and on to get it working.  Other than that issue it has worked very well.  The only downside is that it tells me how far off I was on my mileage estimation before.  :(
Great!
Probably the best kit for the money. I am 100% satisfied.  Even the place that installed the kit was impressed for what was paid. Always go with oxygen free.
NICE
"This is the only screen protector I've ever used that went on with no imperfections on the first try. I've used it for almost a year and it looks like it did the day I installed it. So far, it's completely scratch proof and it hides fingerprints."
"Fantastic!! It fits perfectly, was delivered on time, and looks great. Snagged my sweater a little but so far so great, otherwise."
Nice product works great. It fits my phone perfectly and the color is just the way it looks. Love it!
My husband loves these.
"Didn't fit, case seemed to small at the bottom so my phone wouldn't really sit in it."
"i have bought several sets of headphones in the $12-$70<br />these are by far the best sounding and absolutely the best value of all that i have tried.<br />they have the best bass response of all of them, and even sound better than many of my corded units."
"Great quality, arrived on time. Very happy with my purchase"
"The silicone pink cover is a little loose, but this is a really good tablet cover for the price."
Pretty much does what it's supposed to do. The only downside is the light stays on... always.
I ordered the case and it was a clear case with a matte paper sticker on it
"Purchased this phone from the Apple Store and it was a pleasant experience. The larger screen size is very nice and comfortable to use. The design of the phone is thin, light, modern and beautiful. It is at times slower than iphone 5 and even iphone 4. There are many dropped calls, and not good reception while talking most of the time. These are the same issues from previous models that unfortunately have not been fixed yet. Overall the larger screen size and modern design make this phone a good decision."
"Did not work at all. I bought 2 of them. They did not hold a charge, and I had it in full sun. Don't buy this product. Not worth it."
"Fits perfectly, have to press hard to operate the touch screen especially getting close to the edges."
"I have seen some complaints about the EL lights not working after a short period of time, but I have had this cable most of the summer and use it once a day at night to recharge my phone. I have had no problem with this product and the lights still illuminate and &#34;move&#34; when charging a device. I think it is a good product if used gently and responsibly."
"First let me start by saying I’ve purchased many Anker products over the years, however the Powerline Micro USB 3ft Gray I am writing about was supplied as a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />I buy Anker products because 1. They work as advertised,  2. They hold up (my first purchase was an Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh External Battery which has made two trips to Disney World, and I continue to use often),  3. Great warranty (18 Months) 4. The only time I needed their customer support it was top rate. (helping me diagnose an issue, sending me replacement, ultimately resolving the issue in a professional and courteous manner.).<br /><br />The Powerline Micro USB has tradition Micro USB cable connection ends so its just as easy to use as any other Micro USB cable.<br /><br />Where it shines is its durability due to being built with bulletproof kevlar fiber.  For my purposes, its the perfect cable for use in my car!  The power port in my car is in the arm rest.  While there is a notch for the cable to come out,  unless you hold the cable in place while closing the armrest,  it pinches the cable enough to almost immediately cause marks and shorts in other cables.  This Anker Powerline Micro USB has held up to a week of opening and closing the armrest without any issues, marks or shorts.<br /><br />This cable will also be really good for those on the go who often just toss their cords in their bag.  You wont have to worry about tangles and untangles causing shorts in the cable.<br /><br />Using the Powerline Micro USB cable in my car with the Anker 9.6A / 48W 4-Port USB Car Charger with PowerIQ Technology was a breeze.  Plug one end into the Car Charger,  the other into my phone, and it charges things fast.  Connecting my Nexus 6, 2013 Moto X, and even the dock for my Moto 360 watch,  it charges them as fast as the Car Charger allows.  No slow does due to the cable.<br /><br />Compared to the standard Anker USBcables I’ve used, the casing on the Powerline Micro USB cable is visibly more sturdy.<br /><br />Over all, I’m impressed.  Anker has managed to build a great cable that is durable enough to deal with life in my car, or my backpack,  that can charge my phones at full speed, and I don’t have to worry abou it developing shorts due to the stresses I put on it.."
The best cell phone case I've owned
"I absolutely love this case. I like that I can use the case to prop up the phone in order to watch videos without holding the phone. I am satisfied with this purchase. The texture of the case took a little while to get used to. Overall, this is a sturdy and protective case for my phone. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"This thing fits like a glove, looks good and is fairly thin, so it does not add that much to the footprint of the phone. No problem getting headphones or the charge cable to operate correctly, nice product!"
Great product! Love it!! Works real good and nice fit for my cell..
An error order. So sad I can't send it back. Completely new in the box. Wish I can return it.
Ordered on Saturday and received it on Monday!
As advertised
thanks
Nice and fast shipping
Nice case for the money
Ok!
Excellent product - crystal clear!
"This is a great gadget that is very important to carry while traveling.<br />I used it while taking a vacation and had no issues at all. it is shock proof, water proof and dust proof . it charges very well and though it took little longer to charge my note 4 but well at least i had backup. I had no electricity outlet for miles and miles but that didn't worry me.its a  high capacity rugged 10200mAh power bank (2.1A Power Output) that is perfect for smartphones, tablets and portable electronic devices.<br />This is cute looking and has  built in flash light , compass and Carabiner. Perfect for people like me who love to spend most of my time outside.<br />I was provided this at discounted price in return for my honest opinion."
works great.
"I am not a dumb person by any means, and I am very good at meticulous jobs. Still, I could not get these to look decent and apply well, and I followed the directions to a T.<br />Waste of money."
Very good.  Thanks.
I love this! The cord is nice and long and much thicker than the crap that Apple gives you. I highly recommend this.
Delivered in condition as expected.
Nice. If they last six months or more its the greatest deal on line!
"Based on my experience with another TomTom product (XL 340), I would not recommend anything from this company. The company is, in fact, sending me E-mails that border on spam because there is no unsubscription link in the E-mails (that I can find) and no way to delete the account without contacting customer service.<br /><br />Here is my experience with the XL 340<br />Unreliable and unmaintainable junk<br /><br />After I attempted to perform the last recommended map update, I got a flashing red X on the screen. In addition, TomTom Home said the device was not connected to the computer, even though Windows and File Manager recognized its presence.<br /><br />I do give TomTom technical support 5 stars for effort; the representative made every possible effort to recommend solutions . None of these worked, though, and neither did those posted online at TomTom.com. I was told that TomTom would give me a 20 percent discount if I purchased another; my response was that I was not going to reward poor quality by actually purchasing another product from that company. I just<br />bought a Garmin Nuvi 2555LMT as a replacement today.<br /><br />I was also told that, if the TomTom is old and the memory chip is &#34;worn out,&#34; it will not accept map updates, and will display the flashing red X on the screen. As far as I know, and I have some professional experience in the semiconductor industry, memory chips do not &#34;wear out&#34;--unless they are unreliable trash such as might be produced offshore under substandard conditions. In addition, the memory chip is not replaceable even though flash memory is relatively cheap nowadays; this means the product is not designed for maintainability either. That is, it does not meet the basic requirements of design for reliability and maintainability. (Does not constitute formal engineering advice, but this is more along the lines of common sense--e.g. the TomTom is similar to a light socket in which you cannot replace the bulb, or a flashlight in which you cannot replace the battery).<br /><br />As a result of the need to buy the same thing (GPS navigation device) twice because it didn't work right the first time, TomTom is permanently disqualified from selling me anything in the future."
Easy to set up and very useful.
Great quality
"I bought an original one from apple store for 22$.<br />I needed another one as back up to keep in the office, so instead of buying it from apple store, I ordered this on Amazon for less than 5$.<br /><br />NOT A GOOD IDEA. It does't stay in place firmly. Move laptop a little bit and the screen is gone. Avoid it if you are planned to use a display port for an important presentation. You don't wanna get embarrassed :D."
Charger works well on our Iphone 5 products and sturdier than the ones that come with the phones
Awesome case only case we use for iPhone  otter box too bulky
"Great product.  I've used other types in the past, and this is the best by far."
very pretty just what I wanted
"If you don't have Bluetooth or an aux jack in your car, this is perfect. Signal is clear, despite going over radio."
Great case to protect the Ipad. Could have been perfect if it had magnetic holder/ clasp built into the cover.
I purchased this case mainly for the belt clip/protective front cover which works well. The case itself though is another story. The fit isn't tight at all and you can easily slip the phone out of its protective layer without removing the backside hard shell. The silicone is just too soft and slippery. I am using the belt clip with a different manufacturers case (MoKo) that I also purchased on Amazon. That case is much more secure and retains the phone very well. I wish it had come with the belt clip portion like this case has since then it would have been perfect. All in all this is an inexpensive item so I won't knock it as it does add some protection to your phone and provides a kick stand so you can prop your phone up to watch a video etc. I probably would have paid as much just for the belt clip portion of this case if I were to buy it at a local retailer. Maybe my example wasn't perfect and another may fit tightly. I had the same issues with covers for a couple older Apple I Pod touch's where the silicone was just so slippery and soft that the I Pod would simply slide right out with any use. Hope this helps someone that is looking for a case for the Moto G. I would highly recommend the MoKo branded version as that case fits much more securely and also offers the kick stand.
The ring is very good and the quality is OK  I like it a lot
"Awesome, thank you"
These worked for about a week.  Now they are useless.
"The title says it all. This is by far my favorite bag I have used. When I opened the package, I examined the bag and seemed to be sealed. I then put a couple cotton balls inside and soaked in in water for about 5 minutes. I opened the bag and they were dry! What makes this better than others is that it's easy to open and close. One of the bags I had before was hard to close. You had to turn these knobs and it would never work. With this it's much different. It easily seals and opens without water coming in. Also, it includes a neck strap and armband to make it easier to carry. I really like this product for the beach. It keeps the sand, salt, and water out. It basically keeps the phone in a seal and confined space, protecting it from water, dirt, sand etc..."
"The colors are great and they fit the Samsung Galaxy S5 pretty well, although I wish they fit a little more snuggly so they didn't come off so easily. The piece above where the phone gets plugged in is a little loose."
It works well
"I only bought this Samsung phone case to see if I would like it better over the Samsung Galaxy Ace Style S765C Stardust s766c Case Wydan (TM) Hybrid Studded Diamond Rhinestone Case but I did not, so I returned it. The color's on the case I loved but, did not keep it long enough to really try it out."
"Had an OtterBox for my S4.  After getting the S5, I opted to try a new case - mistake.  I had my phone less than a month and my 4 year old dropped it onto the floor.  Hit on the side and the screen got a crack across it.  Obviously, didn't protect from a simple fall."
Super handy.  Great find.
Fit perfectly ! The array of colors were very nice.
"Excellent Day time recording, true Full HD recording, Not very Good in Night time though it produce high noise picture<br /><br />The time Lapse option is quite Good and does a very good job"
"Compared to other reviews I felt like maybe I am missing something? The case seems to be cheaply made. The slots for the cards is very thin, and as I'm sliding cards in/out, I am finding that my cards are getting stuck. As I'm removing my cards the very thin, non-leather nylon /poly part (grey in pic) is super thin, and very loose. I'm not sure if it's because it is not glued down all the way.<br />The actual phone part, is hard to place your phone in, or remove your phone from.<br />The quality feels soft, but does not feel or smell like real leather. I do not recommend this product if your looking for something of decent quality. I received this product at a promotional price, in exchange for my honest review."
Good
IT TOOK ELEVEN DAYS TO GET HERE AND WHEN INSTALLED WAS DIFECTIVE AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE A REPLACEMNT
"Clip fit perfectly to case however, the clip is flimsy and fragile. It fell apart in about a week."
Excellent product.
Perfect sound - I take it everywhere and bought one for each of my employees to make them more productive..
Everything was perfect!  Thanks
"Looks great, feels great :) (hasn't fallen yet)"
"Love this car mount! I love that it's easy to move from one air vent to the other. And my phone REALLY sticks to it, it will not budge or fall off.<br /><br />You put this little magnet sticker on the back of your phone. It was a tight fit, but I managed to put mine underneath the battery back of my LG G4 and it still closes fine. Then put the magnet on any vent, and your phone will snap right to it when held within a few inches of it.<br /><br />-1 Star because there isn't a lot of room for maneuverability, depending on the location of your car vents, you may not like the angle that your phone is sitting at. In that regard, a dash or window-mounted holder is much more flexible. But I don't like the look of those mounts, and they are harder to move from car to car.<br /><br />Also, since it's summer the A/C running keeps my phone really, really cold when its on the air vent mount. Hoping no issues in the winter when I'm using heat."
"Got this to replace my FitBit Flex that had bit the dust for the 2nd time.<br /><br />If all you are looking for is a pedometer/exercise tracker, then you may like it.  If you are looking for something that will work with other fitness apps, forget it and keep looking.  The S Health app from Samsung leaves A LOT to be desired, especially if you are accustom to My Fitness Pal or apps like that.  It doesn't even come close.  From what I've been able to find, I'm not sure it will ever work with My Fitness Pal.<br /><br />For my money, another FitBit would have been a better investment."
Works great and the price was right. The 2 different charge rates (one 1amp one 2.1amp) are a nice feature.
"I would give it 5! I bought this at the beginning of February 2015. I have used this thing basically every day since. I dropped it two days ago and it's unaffected! Still works like a charm. On a completely full charge, I can charge my Samsung S5 and my girlfriend's iPhone and still have enough juice to recharge my S5 two more times.<br /><br />I love this battery do much, I just bought another one and it was delivered today...SUNDAY!<br /><br />5 stars all around. Very dependable, very durable,  it surpasses my expectations at the &#34;under $40&#34; price point.<br /><br />Well done!"
Doesn't fit the phone properly
"Have older car so this is perfect,"
I liked the macro lens the most. So sharp! I gave it 4 stars because the wide angle had so much vignette. But this thing is totally worth the money! Works in Sony Xperia z3 compact.
Pretty case but doesn't fully fit my phone. It still works.
My Double Din stereo doesn't fit through opening.<br />Quite obnoxious to assemble with a detailed instructions manual that's just vague enough about which part is which to be confusing.<br />$15 wasted.  This will end up in the trash as I'll need to buy a different kit.
I like it so far.  Easy install and no rattles.
Great sound for the price.
"This stuff was pretty bad.  It worked great for the first week, and we had read about the wire shorting out in other reviews, so were careful, but it shorted out pretty quick and became rather touchy as to whether or not it would work, depending on the day or the weather or what the heck ever.  Now it only works out of one speaker sometimes, so we're definitely going to look for a different one."
excelent
"Got this for my son's phone.  The design print is good, and the case is well made.  Warning: once the case goes on, it does not come off easily.  This is good, as it means that it should stay attached during a drop to the ground.<br /><br />We did have to trip some of the plastic away from the inner edge of the screen side as it was pressing on his glass screen protector and causing it to lift.  Simple fix, and won't be an issue if you don't have a glass screen protector."
Perfect fit and good protection for the EasyAcc Classic 10000mAh Power Bank.
Don't work got my phone wet when it feel in the water.
These were great but stopped working completely after one week of use.
Love it!
Color is so much cuter in person. Love it! Arrived 2 days ahead of schedule awesome! Edited I have owned this case for maybe 2 months already. My phone has fallen and all still no cracks or damages. I really love the way this case was built. I wish they had more cases to choose from. I love my owl case but sometimes I like to change the skins. Truly one of the best cases I have bought other than the otter box this has to be my favorite!  LOVE IT!!
works great
"Great case...sturdy, durable and good looking. Very pleased."
This is one of the worst products i have ever purchased from amazon. I got 1 star because i hade to click one to submitt it. Problem is that I had the case for less than 3 weeks and it was already peeling. I have taken the case off my phone because all the peeling makes it look ugly and trashy. So this was a bad product. I will tell anyone NOT TO WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!! ITS HORRIBLE!!!!
"My iPhone 5c in a Speck case is still too small to fit into the mount, and falls out frequently. It also does not stay straight up in my air vents. I wish I would have returned this for another one, because I am not impressed."
"Rugged cable, good quality. Didn't help my cell as my power jack is bad but worked perfectly on other usb items! Amazons price was a third of the truck stop price and half of other stores for this same item. I will buy one for every charger I have."
Really good
Arrived quickly and saved my phone!
Great case
"I got mine in the mail the other day ,and the day after it had already started to break down. The &#34;ink&#34; in the front came off very easy."
"Loved the item and got a plethora of compliments on it. Only issue is that it did not last; after about 2-3 drops the case started to crack and break. Which gave me a sad face cause I loved the case and style. I had to go back to the Duro case I bought 2 years ago which I have dropped more time than I can count and it's still trucking! However, if you want compliments and love retro Nintendo, this is a great case; just be sure to take care of it and not drop it."
"Ordered this phone and everything worked great for the first 33 days, on the 34th day the camera quit working and the phone gets too hot to hold it in your hands. Of course the return policy is only good for 30 days, so I'm out 240 bucks. I don't recall ever leaving a negative review on amazon.com before this one. I was so excited about it too."
Very cute and decent quality.
nice unit  works well
Excellent
This is very easy to use although sometimes it starts taking rapid photos for some reason. I'm glad I can finally take decent family pictures.
"I picked this case up for my wife, and she loves it.  Functional and stylish.  The micro-dots on the backing do a great job of keeping the case from &#34;clinging&#34; to the back of th device.  I'm glad that I stumbled onto the Verus brand.l"
Very good quality item. Easy to use and at a good price. I would recomendamos this selfie stick to anyone that's looking for an easy to use good quality product.
"There are so many reasons to love this case.<br />1. It's really easy to put on<br />2. Has good protection, extra on the corners cause phones always seem to drop on the corners<br />3. Not bulky so it will still fit in your pocket or purse<br />4. Good grips on the edges so you are less likely to drop your phone<br />5. It's light weight, only adding 1.3 oz of weight to your phone<br />6. I have the black but it comes in really cool colors also<br />A five star item for sure. I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review."
"So far, so good!  I installed this and tried it out a little over the weekend.  Very low noise from the bluetooth device plugged into one end, MUCH lower than any plug in adapters I've tried.  Plugged my phone into the other side and it seems to charge very fast.  I only took one star off because the power input wires are SO short, only about 4-5 inches!  This made for slightly tougher installation than I was expecting, as I was installing this in the dash."
"This is basically my go-to-case when I am doing things outside or the possibility of dropping it a lot. I love the pink and white, something different than most otter boxes. It is very durable, there are some spaces in between the rubber case and hard case, but I am not too picky. It would look nicer if the fit was better, but it protects my phone and that's what it was made for!"
"Works great !  No complaints.  I give it 4 stars because the phone, while on the kickstand, slides if you touch it, and when the phone vibrates it moves around; the phone could fall off the desk or table.  The end of the kickstand (the leg) really needs a rubber boot on the end of the kickstand so that it will not slide around. I have no idea why there is even such a thing as the stylus; completely useless since there is nowhere to store it. I received the product in a reasonable amount of time. I am very satisfied with this product.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it will not fit my new Samsung Galaxy S3. I would most definitely purchase this item again, if this company had one that would fit my S3, I would certainly buy it !!"
Works great for holding my Magellan GPS or my iPhone on the dashboard.
"I received a discount for a fair product review.  Awesome screen protector, will recommend to others"
Nice
can't go wrong with these.
Works great. Fast shipping.
several compliments and inquiries as to where it came from.
"This charging station has made my desk so organized. I highly recommend this product, it looks great and takes care of loose random wires while keeping my toys in one place."
I'm verry happy for this product
It is protective.  Not the highest quality!
"I bought this last month. Used it one time, SHORTLY! I plug it into my iphone today and it doesn't even work! Very disappointed and it cannot be returned or even exchanged for a new one, because the return window just ended (of course it did). What a waste of money!"
This seems to be really protect the phone.  I was very pleased.
Tiny little screw drivers for those tiny little screws.
"I hadn't owned an HT in over a decade, but I was familiar with Yaesu from my time with a VX-5R as a newly-licensed Technician-class ham in 2001. Recently, I was looking for an HT I could carry with me on backpacking and hiking trips where I thought it would be useful to have in case an FM repeater was the only way of reaching help if needed - as well as an easy way to get NOAA weather reports in case the weather turned ominous. Looking around at the HT landscape, things had definitely changed since the early ‘00s. Built-in TNCs, D-Star, and the proliferation of discount Chinese HTs; I didn’t mind spending a little more for something built to commercial standards, but which manufacturer offered the best value?  I ended up choosing Yaesu’s FT-60R because it did everything I needed, and nothing I didn’t. Reasonably-wide dual band receive coverage (No 162MHz weather coverage on the FT-817ND, Yaesu? Really?), built-like-a-brick construction, and no extra digital modes or features beyond FM voice. I also appreciated the twin analog/volume controls; I “test-drove” a Kenwood TH-F6A that had a menu-set squelch, and coming from the VX-5R I didn’t realize how much I missed that feature until I used the Kenwood. I live in a somewhat rural area, so intermod has never been a significant problem, but the receiver seems somewhat resilient to out-of-band interference - even on top of local peaks inhabited by transmitters that dwarf ham repeaters. The physical size is just perfect; big enough to provide some heft and balance in your hand, but doesn’t feel like you have a block of lead clipped to your belt after a day’s trek.  Finally, the downsides – it does come with an SMA connector, but I think the days of BNCs on ham HTs are numbered. Fortunately, there’s an excellent adapter available from Stephen Gulyas, KC2BHO,  that solves that issue very effectively, and without any stress on the connector.; if you can live with the extra length, Diamond’s RH-77CA makes a world of difference."
"Perfect fit, went on easily. Instructions were good. All pluses in my book."
"Have only used this a few times since purchasing, but it has worked flawlessly and as expected.  Bought to take on a cruise so that we could recharge phones and devices on deck for listening to music and such.  Didn't end up using on deck, but did while we were out on excursions.  Can fully charge wife's iPhone5S several times before needing to be recharged.  I also like the size - surprising amount of stored power in a decent sized package."
"I laughed at the device when I first used it and it told me just how long I should expect to be in traffic. The joke was on me when it was 100% correct - and it continues to amaze me.<br /><br />You'll read a lot of negative reviews about not being able to change the color of the maps (like you're able to do with previous TomTom operating systems) but really, who cares? The speed at which this locates you and maps your route is amazing. Yes, you can only access the traffic data if your smartphone is paired through bluetooth, but the amount of data it uses is actually incredibly small. I'm talking under 10 megabytes with a month of constant use!<br /><br />Even if you have an existing TomTom, you'll be amazed by this device, once you get used to the new and much different interface. Searching for points of interest is done in a common sense method now.<br /><br />Oh, one last  thing, you CAN now map a route through the TomTom app (available in the play store, and presumably the apple store) and as soon as your phone and gps reconnect, the route you planned on your phone is instantly sent to the device, and you're in your way."
I hate this thing. I really wasted my money. It does not track well. It has a hard time connecting to the app to sync everything. They think they gonna get me to pay $12 a month? Sike!
Fits good. Thank you.
Works for what I need it for.  Wallet part could be a bit bigger.
Great
Love my case just as expected
I absolutely love this phone case!!!!!!! I get so many compliments on it and would definitely repurchase it again. The price and shipping for this product was great!!
"great phone. I bought it for easier messaging and a phone.  It has features I'll never use, some I may use. The only thing that I'd like is a front facing camera so I can Skype!"
Works great.  Only concern was the magnetic affect on the phone.  I took a chance and a few months later all well.  It works perfect.  I love it.
"Love this product, small and works very well. Love the low profile."
"This worked great for about 2 weeks and then out of the blue it just stopped charging altogether.  Very disappointed as I was<br />so happy to have found a long cord, it's a shame it wasn't reliable or sturdy to last longer than days.  I will be returning this item."
"Broke easily, and is hard to put on and hard to take off too."
This device did not connect to my iPhone and also was very poor quality. I would not recommend purchasing this item.
"The one we received was not for my phone. Either we ordered the wrong one or was sent the wrong one. It wasn't noticed until the phone was taken apart. Unless you know exactly what you are doing, I would not recommend ordering this part. The screws are extremely tiny & different ones for different places. If its an iPhone Apple will not touch it if you get into trouble & can't get it back together. I had to get a new phone."
"Prone to dropping my phone so this works well for me, good shock proof. Its not screen protective since it is an open case (ie dont bang it on sharp corners) but for dropping it, the screen shouldn't crack.. ive had this for 5 months now and its still doing a great job! It doesnt really have any issues with not being able to fit a charger or headphones into it while its on so thats another plus."
"waste of money, 1 worked for about 5 minutes and the other 2 do not charge at all"
"The tuner in this unit has never worked properly.  I have only been able to tune in 1 station cleanly.  Tech support had no options, other than take it to repair center.  Purchased this M303 along with a XC1410 amp, and both are defective.  The replacement amp has now failed, and again tech support/customer service has no option for me.  I will not be buying Clarion products ever again, poor quality and poor customer service."
great!
Received super fast and well packaged. The item itself is very good. Easy to apply to my phone and leaves no air bubbles upon application. Didn't have to go in to the store to get it applied. I like that you get 3 for the price of 1. Item was provided at a discounted rate for review purposes but that does not influence the validity and truthfulness of my review.
Your product sucks!!!!!
Great product and very nicely done.
"My phone charges in 1 hour with Anker cables and 4 hours with cheap $1 cables. The difference is probably lower resistance, thicker gauge wire, which means less voltage loss between your charger and your device (phone). Good build quality. I use the longest cable reaches the back seat of a sedan when plugged into the DC power socket (cigarette adapter) next to the stereo."
Love this amount of pens.  Like another reviewer said these are great for the office where we also have a problem of pens growing legs and walking off.  Gave 100 to the interns and about 50 to our admin office for the sign in books and still have enough for the family if they need pens or we are scrambling for something to write with.
Tracker has quit working after 1.5 months.
Working like it should.
"Have had no issue with this and it has definitely outlasted any of the Apple cables. Keep it at home, throw it in my backpack, travel with it. It's good quality, but I know there was one or two off times when I got a &#34;not a certified apple product&#34; warning on my phone when I plugged it in (but usually that was resolved by unplugging and plugging it back in)."
sorry to say I was just not impressed.
"Still in great shape, two years later"
love it👌🏼
perfect thank you
love it
"The USB charging port cutout on the bottom wasn't large enough. I couldn't get the factory charge cable nor my Amazon Essentials cable to flushly connect. If i held it in by hand it would charge, but as soon as I let go the cable popped out. I had to cut off the bottom front trim where the port cutoff is. The cables then fit fine.<br /><br />Also the gold plastic trim is free floating. Paper money tends to get stuck in it when its in my pocket."
WAY too difficult figuring out how to use the product.  I've essentially abandoned the product and wrote it off as a failed experiment.
First screen protector that I've brought and put on myself. Delivery was fast and the product was packaged well. The screen protector came with instructions and it was simple to apply to my new Note 5.
Sweet charger barely bigger than iPad charger but with 5 ports. Very well made
This doesn't work on my phone (Galaxy 3) due to some idiotic thing that Samsung added with the last update. It works like a champ on my husband's phone.
Perfect for that charge on the go.
"Working fine so far. We have had trouble with these dying early, but this one is supposed to last. I like that it comes with an 18mo warranty."
"I've tried several types of mini tripods in the past for phones and webcams and some of the real cheap one are so light and flimsy that they tip over when the wind blows or if you have a USB cable attached they'll just collapse at the slightest change in weight distribution.<br /><br />For this, I was originally looking for a tripod for my point-and-shoot camera and then saw this one that can also be used with my phone.  I haven't used the bluetooth remote feature, but as a tripod alone I feel that this one is plenty sturdy and will not fall over easily.<br /><br />There are probably other decent tripods for half the price I paid for this, but the value in this is it has a phone adapter included.  That being said, the price just went down $5.00 since I bought it! :)"
"In exchange for a fair review, I was given a PROMO code and I am just amazed!"
"Very poor quality and doesn't fit my phone.  The edges don't stretch to cover the entire phone and the color is not at all like the picture.  It is more of a dark yellow color.  The cover is flimsy and does not give any protection to the phone.  Also, the shipping took a long time-- over 2 weeks.  I do not recommend.<br /><br />I received a discount for my honest opinion."
Opening is weird and it's hard to turn on
I love it. It does exactly what the description says
Everything works great!
Ordered as a gift.
Delivery was late but the item works as descrbed.
Just as expected. My toddler uses my phone to play games and it is holding up nicely. The stand is a bit difficult to get out but I would recommend this product.
nice
It works well but stopped providing charge after time. I want to say I received a few months out of it Max
It work out great.
Good solid case.  Would buy it again.
Didn't work. Waste of money. Threw it away! It gets one star because I couldn't post zero stars.
Very pleased with the product after having it replaced.  Avantek quickly replaced my defective product with a new transmitter. They were very concerned and worked hard to achieve my satisfaction.
my fourth E980 phone. love. not a replacement i just have four.
These earbuds are user friendly..fairly comfortable.stay In your ear.I use them at the gym( lighting weights.sit ups..and tread mill running..no problems what do ever.give it a try.worth it.worst case it makes a great back up.next option up is nasty bird scale and power beats2
nice cable
"I love this screen protector, Im always dropping my iPhone and with this screen protector it has not broke, I'm so happy with it."
Only 3 months of use and it is already falling apart. I'm convinced there is no good lightning cables out there.
Love my power backup :D
Really cute. Not much protection to the phone but really pretty.
"Works well, does QC 1.0/2.0 as advertised."
"wast of my time and money, did not work"
"The case is very difficult to get off the phone and cause my phone to go flying out of it when I tried to remove the case, causing me to drop and break parts of my phone. Love the case but the lock for the lighter will not stay latched either"
Pretty well made and my daughter loves it!
Very impressed with this product. The sound quality is great
It's a great case. It feels like I put no cover on my phone. Keep it slim!
Great product. Been useful for my month of traveling. Would definitely consider getting another one
Love this case!
"i make a video with my aquarium, fanastic really, buy it!"
"I just received my screen protector today and was eager to try this thick tempered glass for my newly bought LG G3. Installation is easy but my problem is it doesn't fit my entire screen. I'm disappointed, I had high hopes for this screen protector but I'm missing 8 mm for the bottom."
"So many items I've ordered end up being a different color once I get them. This, I'm proud to report, was not one of them. It looks exactly as photoed here.<br /><br />The green is pretty, and unique. It isn't neon or dark, it is somewhat in between. A darkened neon, perhaps? It's see through as well so you are able to see the apple logo clearly. The bumper is white and plastic, but very sturdy.<br /><br />This will protect your phone well. It is cushiony and secures the phone well, especially with that added bumper. It's very pretty, fits well, and stands out compared to some standard cases.<br /><br />*I purchased this product at a discount. This review contains my honest and unbiased feedback. All thoughts/opinions are my own entirely."
"I love the phone but there's a problem with the battery, it did not charge to the fullest after a week it cannot charge none at all have the phone and cannot use it can you please send me a replacement battery thank you"
It is a perfect fit!
Terrible voice nobody can hear me.
"Great Sound, Great Battery life."
It's ok but after you use it and take it off you phone a couple times it not that much off a water proof
excellent
This is a real charger not like those fake 2.1A chargers
NICE
Low price and easy to use
I like it and paid way less than an Apple Watch!
"Very sexy looking, well fitting, and good looking case. Only thing it could possibly do better is be waterproof.<br />Survived a few falls already."
It worked good
holds up well not very protective but i get a lot of compliments on it
Very good product
"Compact, simple and effective. Rarely did I have trouble with people understanding me."
Easy to apply and good fit . seems thick and protective
Two cute pink elephant bookends. Great for a child's room and look better than the generic black metal bookends that can be purchased anywhere.  I gave the product 4 stars because it wasn't wrapped that well for shipping and the bookends were bent slightly inwards. I gently bent them to a 90 degree angle without any damage. Expect shipping to take 2-3 weeks as they product comes directly from China.
Turns off after 3 seconds or doesn't charge at all
"This is a great product. I was nervous about wearing my 42mm Stainless Steel Apple Watch out when working in the yard or when working out as I didn't want the stainless steel to scratch. I'm not so worried about the face as it's sapphire on my model. For years I've used a similar style of rubber case on my iOS devices to protect the case. This product filled the need for me with the Apple Watch. The product is 100% soft rubber so there's no risk of any device scratching from the inside. When installed on the Apple Watch it does not increase the thickness of the case. Additionally the colors add the ability to mix and match the styles as needed. This was exactly what I needed.<br /><br />The only con of this product is getting it on the Apple Watch is tricky. You need to remove at least one side of the band to make it easy because the bands actually slip through the case. I've seen other products (not tested) that slip on the sides making installation faster an easier. I would imagine that those are also easier to fall off accidentally.<br /><br />I'm not using this all the time but when doing activities where my watch may come into contact with something hard accidentally I'm throwing this on for protection.<br /><br />I purchased this product from Amazon and have not received and compensation, free product or other benefit from the manufacturer or Amazon for my review. The product tested was NOT a free sample from the manufacturer and the opinions stated above are solely mine based on my interaction with the product."
Happy with purchase
"I can't in truth describe with words how crappy this case is, but i will try. First of all the metal on the case is similar to die cast metal, like the kind they use in toys. Second, the rubber is hard rubber, so one drop and hard rubber meets metal, and say goodbye to your phone. So stupid to have a phone case made of metal. So stupid!! That is not all folks. Next, the holes in front on the gorilla glass are not covered by anything, so when you go to wipe the glass with water to wipe off the smudges, the water goes in between the glass and the phone, and you have to unscrew the back, and take the case off to clean the water off!! Lastly, the rubber piece that covers the charging port broke off after one day, because it is also made of hard rubber. This case sucks. I mean, if you buy this, you need to check your skull for bullet holes; like i did. Just stay away from this case, it is a phone killer in the disguise of an attractive case."
Screen installation was a breeze! It lasted for a good ample amount of time! Will purchase again!
Works as advertised...even backed up iPhone with no problem.
GREAT SOUNDING LOW PROFILE SUB
The was a gift that the person recevied said was awesome.
Great product.
"Excellent Bluetooth.  My friends think I'm talking on my home phone.  I'm a truck driver, the noise reduction on this unit is amazing.  I would recommend this."
"Charges amazingly fast.Slightly heavy,but a small inconvenience for the power."
Works better than the POSH phones that have the &#34;same&#34; specs.
as expected.
Sometimes it will re-charge but most of the time it wont. Very disappointed with this purchase.
It was very long....!
This is a great product it's made from a  strong durable material  that really helps protect my phone!  I love the bright mint color it looks great on my white iPhone. The case also has a lip on the front that  helps might protect my phone while it was laying facedown .  This is an all-around great phone case I'm so glad I was given this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review !
Nice case. Just as described.
Your product is bulls***. Overheats the charger and phone within minutes. I WILL figure out how to return your POS charger.
does not pick up at all
its great i cant wait till it comes it seen reviws of this
Great supplement to any Garmin bundle.  Price was better than I could find locally and it got to the house in a reasonable amount of time.
"Could have been thinner, but still pleased. Blue matches picture, holds a few cards and or cash. Clasp slightly block the power button vs clasp less design (non wallet) I had before, but is reasonable.<br /><br />The whole thing would have been nicer if thinner.<br /><br />Note the clasp on mine is square, not beveled if that is a concern."
Its already breaking and ive had it for 3 months
Very well please with the dock and play if I had the chance and I needed another one I would buy again
"Don't buy, doesn't work."
Good Charger
"I got this phone in an emergency, because my old phone died and I needed a basic replacement in a hurry before I got my new phone in the fall. I love this phone as a basic phone. This may be the best economical phone that there is! It's true, that this is very slow, but besides this phone being slow, it's pretty awesome! And, not all parts are slow, I'm able to text and unlock it with the speed of a very quick phone. I just can't play very many games on it. This ended up being great, because I'm vacationing in Nicaragua next month, so I've been trying to learn Spanish, and I've been using mainly Duolingo on this phone. And, it's awesome at Duolingo, and other lightweight applications. The GPS on this phone actually worked better than it does with all of my other phones, which was pretty awesome.<br /><br />I also like that it's small and easy to hold. Most phones are a little too big, and this one is perfect. It fits in my pocket without bulging. It's thin, but not too thin, too, so for me, it's a perfect size. It takes the giant SIM cards, so I had to get an extender so that my regular SIM card would fit, but it ended up working out great. I could have gone to T-Mobile to get a new SIM card, but they charge me for everything. And, it takes two SIM cards. There are a ton of features about what to use with what. So, you can use data only with one SIM and phone only with the other SIM, if you want. And, you can switch back and forth with an Android setting, if you want, too. I wasn't able to test this out, since I just have one SIM, but the interface looks cool. There's not much space on this, only about 1GB free when you start, so you'll need to watch the memory closely, and get an SD card where you push most of your stuff to. And, it's stuck on Android 4.2. There was one update, but it just updated it to another version of Android 4.2. Oh, and something else that i loved, is that it has a reboot option. With most Androids, you can't just reboot, so I love Blu for including this.<br /><br />I have to warn you again that it's slow. To get the most out of this phone, make sure that you don't have very much installed, and get a task killer to use before you need any kind of performance. But the slowness is all usually in between application switches, and with it doing things more slowly than other phones. This is basically like a Yaris with four big people in it, and 500 lbs in the trunk. It will go, but won't go up hills very fast. And, just like the Yaris, I love this phone!<br /><br />Overall, this is awesome. And, if you're okay with a slower phone, this would be a great phone. I used it for a month before i got my new Moto G, and now I'm going to keep it as a backup phone, or if a friend loses a phone. And, this would be an awesome phone for a child or a mom who keeps breaking or losing their phone. And, I'm a 43-year old man, and it was a great phone for me, too.cluding this.<br /><br />I have to warn you again that it's slow.

"This product looked great, and functioned great for exactly 12 hours. Unfortunately, after attaching it to my windshield the evening before, I got in the car in the morning to find it lying on the ground. After repeated attempts to re-attach it, it would keep falling off immediately, no suction. Upon further inspection I discovered that the suction cup had completely fallen apart (as you can see in the picture). Might I remind you that I had only had this product for 12 hours.<br /><br />It was a real shame too since the rest of the product seemed extremely sturdy, at it was one of the few car mounts out there that actually satisfied my needs (windshield attachment + long, flexible arm). I may ask for a replacement but it seems like from these other reviews (perhaps the ones not bought?) that it will very likely just happen again. Very disappointing."
Like it
I was ordering for a galaxy light these did not work
"Great, works very well."
"So far, so good. I'm really enjoying all the features on my new phone. I looked at a bunch of reviews online before purchasing, and decided that this was the best phone for the money. I have had zero issues with it, and it does everything that I need it to. Camera even takes pretty good pictures! I'm impressed, but then, I already was a fan of ASUS."
"the bolt is not glued to the plastic, so the hold is wably/loose. i've owned one of these before. this one is clearly damaged."
Didnt fit the droid razor
Works as intended and doesn't feel like it is going to break.<br /><br />I can't use it on my car's air vents because this is too heavy for them. Sucks for me but not the product's fault.
Al Ud excelent
"What the hell ? It didn't even come with tools.  I assume a &#34;full set&#34; means tools and all ??!! Thanks, not buying this again."
These are great!!!  And the price is even more amazing...I highly recommend these for purchase
I play a lot of golf and I really like the Approach S3. Courses are easily recognized and the convenience of having it on my wrist  is great. I previously was a user of Sky Caddie. This is much better in my opinion.
"fast shipment, great quality for the price."
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Awesome deal! Case fits well and have gotten many compliments on it!
"So just wanted you to know, your Selfie Stick is so good that it was stolen the second time I used it!<br />Right off the table I was sitting at :(<br />Guess i’ll have to buy one - or two - more!!!"
Arrived quickly and works well.
"Fit perfectly.  I like the rubberized feel of the case.  It is not slippery, this is what I was looking for in a case."
Not it did not meet my expectations. When you put your phone in the holster it turns the volume of your phone down ALL the way. Not impressed with my purchase at all.
I purchased this to hep me keep track of my steps but it has many additional benefits.  I highly recommend if you're that person that wants to be reminded not to get stuck at your desk too much or to do better about going to bed.
Best wireless charger I've ever used.
"Everyone these days has a phone, but it has become a hazard to keep it in a pocket with people around who may do things like shove you into a pool or turn on the garden hose. Thank goodness I had my phone in my waterproof iPhone case by u deserve tech, because this happened to me just the other day. My husband and I were playing outside with the kids with the garden hose. It was hot and everyone was getting wet. I had my phone in it's case in my pocket, My husband suddenly turned the hose on me and laughed when I got soaked. It took him a minute to stop and realize my phone was with me and asked if it was okay or if we needed to sit it in a container of rice. I pulled it out and showed him it was in my case safe and sound. He was relieved but soaked me again. It worked fantastic. No issues with leaking or anything. A nice high quality case. Keep yourself safe from people and water. Because no warranty these days covers water damage.<br /><br />*I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT TO TRY IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW. EVERYTHING IN THIS REVIEW IS 100% MY OWN AND HAS NOT BEEN INFLUENCED OR ALTERED IN ANY WAY"
"Ordered almost a year ago. I was sent a faulty, mix match digitizer and screen, I sent it back being promised I would be sent a New one....8 months later I still have nothing."
works fine & costs less than the Motorola unit.
It was exactly what I wanted. Lightweight. Fit the s6 perfect. Wish they had more colors to choose from.
"It fit just right, could have been little thicher"
Basically does what it is supposed to and is pretty useful (particularly while traveling). Faster charging would be awesome but I guess that is in general a technical challenge and cost prohibitive...
Great fit and decent audio. First picture is incorrect. Earbud must be used in right ear.
Good product
Item was exactly as stated! Cables were like new! Sync and all specified functions work perfectly.
"I got the wrong one on the mail, i got one for the iphone 4.!"
"I've been through many headphones and these are by far the best I've ever used.  They fit great and comfortable too.  Used them on a 15 mile training run then, came home and mowed and did yard work for several hours and they were still going strong when I finished.  Great battery life!  I've purchased a few things from this company and the customer service is beyond first class.  If you have ANY kind of problem they will make it right, no hassles and very quickly."
"I was given this product in exchange for a review. I am so glad i purchased this! In my opinion everyone needs an extra, its very nice quality seems like its from the manufacture! The color is identical. I am very pleased!"
"This gives my phone such personality, it fits great, and it is lasting well for the price!"
"I got this stylus and returned it on the same day. It doesn't work unless you really push it on your screen. I tried it on iPad 4, iPhone 5 & 5S, and iPod 4. Every time the same result. You have to push it very hard on the screen in order for the stylus to be active. Otherwise, it doesn't work. I don't recommend it."
"Excellent item and service,we are in need of sellers with the same conduct of business as Falcon itech TM.<br />Keep it real, bless!"
"Product arrived in good condition, was easy to install znd fit the Samsung Galaxy 4 phone well. Only thing I've noticed is that touchscreen seems  more sensitive than old one. Sometimes when I'm talking on phone, it seems that my ear pressing against glass opens up other apps or screens!"
"Good product, but sweating like crazy over the ears when working out,"
This wallet phone case is very well made.  The phone easily snaps in.  I like the added protection of the cover when I put it in my purse or when it is just lying on the table.  Magnetic clasp is strong.  I also like how it folds to a stand.  It's perfect to use to entertain your toddler when you are at a restaurant or appointment!  I also like how you can close the cover and still talk on the phone.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
Works perfect on my LG G Stylo.
very satisfied
Just got mine today love it 😁
VERY NICE CASE FOR THE PRICE
"Works well, nice size and price."
Awesome
Best car charger I've ever had chargers so quick everyone that has quick charge on their phone should have this charger. Especially if your phone supports quick charge 2.0.
"I love this phone case because if it's multiple uses. It's not cheaply made, it has stood against my teething child gnawing on it with no wear to show for it. The design is adorable! Overall, this was an awesome purchase, well worth it, came earlier than expected, no issues. Would definitely purchase from this seller again."
Great idea & makes charging so much simpler.  Super good price as single units of lesser quality cost same or more & this is much better quality.
"I bought two of these phones when they first came out (August 2015). So far, my screen has gone black and now my flash doesn't work and my husband's screen has also gone black and he cannot use his phone without an ear piece because his speaker no longer works. Our screens did come back on within 24 hours. I emailed BLU and never heard back. Maybe others have had better luck, but my experience has been less than stellar."
"Hello everyone! I have the good fortune as to be able to review the Symaxio Wireless bluetooth earphone! I received it free of charge from the company itself, and I was able to test it out and compare it to my other Bluetooth earpiece. The sound quality is great, it’s easy to use, and it holds a charge a lot longer than my old earpiece! Its sleek design and easy to wear earpiece makes the product very comfortable. I enjoyed this product and I hope that you will too, if you are in the market for a Bluetooth earpiece."
"Mostly I really like this product, but find I can't wear it as much as I would have liked because the ear pieces hurt my ears. It's not a problem for shorter periods, but when wearing for 45 minutes or longer, it becomes uncomfortable and then painful. If I don't wear them for a few days it's no problem wearing them again...but was hoping for something I could use on long bike rides and for longer runs.<br />It's a great idea...they're very light and sound is surprisingly good....but for my sensitive ears I'm afraid they weren't quite the answer. My daughter, who has borrowed them a few times...and now maybe forever, has not had the same ear problem I had...so maybe it's just my bad luck.<br />Just something to be aware of."
great cables with fast delivery and a solid guarantee.
Excellent product
"Excellent product.  I am rarely so pleased with electronic cords, but this one is exceptional."
It was for a ATT model. Made it work. Have prpduct with proper carrier listed.
Batteries didn't last very long and only worked when it wanted to. I don't recommend this product.
For the price these are fantastic wireless earbuds. I've listened to about 30 hours of audio books with them. I'm very satisfied.
"I love this! I had to buy another one! It clips perfectly on my belt, short, shirt, and waist fanny pack bag, most of all it clips to yoga pants with no pockets! Only thing The only thing is, you ha e to be careful that of your phone falls, or will break. The support for your phone is not secure.  Other than that, It clips to almost anything and it is great!"
"Works great, simultaneously charges a Google Nexus 4 and an ASUS tablet. On a personal note, I also like the blue light."
Fits perfectly!  L
Just what I wanted!
"I like the way it feels in my hand, and the protection it gives my phone, it's what I need. Also I had a outterbox before this case and that thing was huge, but now that I have this case it's sleek and perfect"
can still see the original phone color come through yet provides good protection. Nice tight fit and slim I have watched my kids drop their phones on concrete or asphalt multiple times with this cover doing its job.
"This is nothing like what you see in the picture. It looks and feels very cheap, especially when it comes to color. There is nothing &#34;gunmetal&#34; about it. However the case does fit the phone perfectly and the buttons feel good, except the spacing will take a bit getting used to."
"If your like me you have probably searched for hours, and bought many phone cases that after a couple uses you just don't like! Well I have personally found the phone case that is perfect for me! The Phonefoam Secret Case is perfect for my and my busy lifestyle. It provides rugged, durable protection for my phone, yet it is multifunction and looks sleek and stylish! The Phonefoam case isn't big and bulky, you will have no problem fitting the phone in your pocket still, but it has foam cushion to support your phone and prevent breaks from dropping. It has an amazing feel to the case, it soft and comfortable to use my phone now. It also has a convenient slot for your drivers license, or credit or debit card that is hidden! So if you loose or misplace your phone, your important card will be hidden, and I doubt the person will have time to find it before you report it missing. That to me is a huge plus! It also has a nice compartment with a mirror and can hold any other cards you need to take on the go with you. The Phonefoam case is so stylish and cute, I love packing my phone inside, it is easy to put on your phone, and easy to take off. It fits perfectly over your phone and doesn't mess with the function of any of the side buttons. I can also plug my phone into my charging dock without removing the case, and the cable fits in perfectly as well. I feel so safe now<br />Packing my phone and important card, because I know my phone is protected and my card is hidden as well. I received this product at a discount price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. The price however does not affect my opinion of the product."
"I was in the market for a powerpack in the 10000mAH range and saw this go on sale, at $25 I thought it was a steal.<br /><br />Barely lasted 3 months of occasional use before the battery died. I was only able to fully recharge my phone once or twice, after that - even when fully charged the power pack would struggle to charge my items (Samsung Galaxy S4 and a Kindle Paperwhite). About a month after I got it the 4th power indicator bar stopped lighting up. Then slowly each week or so I'd lose another bar until finally the unit died, and now will no longer charge.<br /><br />The product description says good for 500 charging cycles, I maybe had 60."
"Super bright ends, works good. The ends are way too bright and the cord lights you can barely see. For the price they are awesome!"
Excellent
none of the 3 cords I received work with my iPhone 5.  No other cords I own have issues. This happens with all 3 iPhone 5 in my house. Too bad
Did NOT fit the phone that it said it would. Very disappointed!!
"Having purchased many 3rd party lightning cables in the past, I thought this cable would be the same. Most 3rd party cables don't work with both sides; they will only work with one side. However, this cable worked both ways and I was genuinely surprised. The charging speed matches that of the OEM cable and syncing works just as well.<br /><br />The build is really well built and looks almost identical to the OEM cable. The only difference I could find is the RAVPower logo on the cable. This cable is a bit shorter than the original cable but I find that actually works in my case because it reduces clutter on my desk. I recommend this cable to anyone who needs another spare cable, car cable, or if your OEM cable has broke. It is a lot cheaper than buying an original cable from apple and it works just as well if not better.<br /><br />Cable was provided for review by RAVPower"
Protects my screen as described :) It's easy to apply if you follow the directions (just make sure you align it correctly because you can't lift it off if it settles). Also fits with a case which is a nice. Now I can throw my phone in my purse without worrying about the screen getting scratched.
"So far so amazing , phones a great buy.. A lot of people are complaining about the screen and speaker ... Screen is great and speaker is actually louder than I thought"
"Absolutely, lifesaver on tons of drops that happened on concrete, water puddle, accidentally jumped into a pool, took a picture under water..  Etc."
"Just to be blunt, I dropped my phone with this case on it and the screen cracked... Useless!"
Finally a product that works! After trying several other manufacturers I came across Touch Charge and my charging problems with my iPhone 6 Plus have been eliminated thanks to this device. Excellent job Touch Charge keep up the good work !A charger that finally works!  Be sure to buy the case with your phone that works in conjunction with the charger it's a perfect combo.
"Do not buy this product, it is junk. Broke the very first time."
They were able to synch with the car DVD but the volume was terrible!!
Great case.
Slightly teetery on speaker docks.  Needs back lean support. I'm depending on Velcro
Nice Charger. Works great.
"Update: they've improved the magnet quality in this substantially, making all my old complaints invalid. It is my favorite travel dock, I keep one in my with bag for whenever I rent a car. The only downside is it can be easy to forget in a car and if you rent a lot you might lose it. I'd buy more than one. Very sticky and firm, even sticks to the wireless charging coil inside of my phone eliminating the need for the metal pad being attached<br /><br />Old review: Not that great. Vibrations from the road make the phone slide around on the mount changing angle and rotation. If you don't have a case for your phone you have to apply the metal piece to the phone itself, which is undesirable, but the strength through a case is not good enough for reliable use. okay for backup in a rarely used vehicle, don't recommend as primary solution.<br /><br />Edit: Company contacted me and supplied a different phone mount, that is not magnetic but springing clamp design. It's not what I wanted but I appreciate that they tried to rectify my problem. I like this brand for other products and would not avoid them in the future because of this phone mount not being for me. Good customer service."
is lousy need to stop the loading least two months in the sun to achieve load as need to connect your phone for 5 hours to achieve a 20 percent charge<br /><br />Es pésimo necesitas dejarlo cargando mínimo dos meses en el sol para que se logre cargar por completo mientras que tu teléfono necesitas conectarlo 5 horas para que se logre cargar un 20 por ciento
Two things that I always need for my iPhone - a protective case and a charging cable. This case makes sure that I have both with me at all times. Pretty ingenious - the cable fits right in the case kickstand. Cool thing is that this cable is also quality - not just a cheap piece of *&#^. Highly recommended.
"Its pretty easy to assemble and works well as expected. There's nothing much that can go wrong when its just cardboard.Compare with Oculus. Its economical, mobile and works. There might be implications for cost effective VR uses in education as well as showing a mock up of a 3D model to a client without using bulky equipment."
I got this case because... uhm... because cats!!! It's super adorable! I love it! I love all stuff with cats on it.
Fast service. Product was as described.
Didnt fit
"Love the look but had to pay a jeweler to put it on.  Definitely not easy to do yourself, especially with old eyes."
Phone fits perfect and looks good
I bought it for my husband and he loves it!
"Perfect,it's delivered as promised.<br />Thank you"
GR8 WOULD RECOMMEND
This case is amazing! It's slim but sturdy. It doesn't add bulk to my phone at all. The rubberized egdes wrap around the lip of the phone and protects the front edges nicely and provide a good grip while holding the phone. Will definately purchase more! :)
"Horrible product. While it does pick up local street cameras, it doesn't make a sound when driving by state troopers, which is my main reason for purchasing. I plan on returning"
Dead on arrival.
"Got this for my Samsung S6.  Easy to install and hoping it does the job if I drop my phone.  However, the instructions within the packaging require a magnifying glass which is really annoying !!<br /> I agree with other posts that its easier to install it horizontal instead of vertical.  Within the instructions it tells you to put two red sticky tabs at either corner to help with alignment which was not useful at all.  This screen protector isn't that hard to put on the phone."
Good product
Not at all what I wanted. The quality but less than desired.
I recently got this adapter and like a lot of people mentioned it does skip several beats multiple times while playing the song.
"When it comes to Android smartphones Samsung is dominant and it’s easy to see why. The Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge have the quality engineering and craftsmanship to go head-to-head with the iPhone 6. Samsung has gone to great lengths to pay attention to detail and provide an exceptional smartphone experience.<br /><br />The Galaxy S6 Edge is cool, but the things that make it unique just don’t impress me that much. I’d recommend just going with the regular Galaxy S6 if you’re in the market for a new Android smartphone.<br /><br />Read the full review on TechSpective.net: http://techspective.net/2015/08/30/review-samsung-galaxy-s6-galaxy-s6-edge-smartphone/"
"Great case, can't get any better for the price."
"The item as promised, very fast shipping...a great case for the money...Just what I was looking for...Great price..."
perfect fit.Nice Look. I love it
Great product at discount price. Seller delivered as listed.
"I've had the retractable charger for about 2 weeks, the retractable cord is already jammed.  I do not recommend this product."
Worked for the first day then my phone stopped reading with this cord. Not worth it.
"Quick Charging, great product.Sturdy and sits at the proper angle on my desk."
"Within five months I was unable to charge the device because the charging port no longer works.  Update 23/09/15   So as of today, i've decided to change my initial review of this product from 2 stars to 4. This is owing to the stellar customer support & service i received from the guys at Anker. They did not hesitate to ship me out a replacement almost instantly and constantly kept in touch to ensure everything was working perfect with the product. I figured that a defective one somehow got away in the bunch, (given that all my other anker devices worked perfect) but they completely made up for it eventually. Gr8 Job!"
LOVE MY LITTLE REMINDER OF JESUS! I KEEP IT ON MY KEYCHAIN!
Easy to stick and strong on daily use!
Love it!
Adapter worked very well.
BAD quality
It's awesome and fits in you purse which is great
Good case
"Overall it was a good purchase. only when i recieved it, the package was open, there was a tiny scrach on the screen under the screen protector, and surprisingly it was the middle east model!!! The package arrived with arabic writings on it. except for this, the mobile is running perfectly. fast processor, crisp screen, amazing camera. I love it."
"I love this phone case! Not only is it a beautiful gold colour but it's so functional! I bought this phone case because I don't like carrying around a wallet or purse, and I tend to leave (lose) my debit card and ID in whatever pair of pants I wore the day before. With this case, I have them on me all the time. The sliding door works perfectly; it doesn't open too far, it makes cards easy to access, and it doesn't open unless you want it to. For something that holds two credit cards, it's also surprisingly slim. This case is also super heavy duty. I dropped my phone from the top of a 20 step staircase onto ceramic tile and there wasn't a scratch on it! For something that does so much, it is completely worth it and I would 10/10 recommend."
Cheaper than apples and works just as nice.
Perfect for my trip down the Chattahoochie
Love it! Extremely recommended.
"I'm not sure if they are discontinuing these ear buds, but they're the best by far! They are comfortable, and provide good bass. I've had about 6 sets of these because I always ruin them but it's my fault. I've put them through the washer several times and they still worked. I've had beats ear buds but they come nowhere close to the 50/50's."
Great!
Another good chose as they quality is excellent.
"I really like my new case it's durable, comfortable to hold, and I like the stands!!!"
Perfect color
Pretty good for the money.
Good product.  Please note that it is not a floating case.  They don't claim it is but I somehow was thinking it was.  It is a good price and does what it says.
So secure -- almost like a suit of armor for your iPhone!!
Fits perfectly on my phone.  Looks and feels great.. Does not diminish any visuals.
You just can't beat Otter. The quality is amazing and if you want to protect your stuff for years then otter is the answer.
works fine good shape
A amazing case the quality and the looks
My new iPhone 5 is my partner in crime while mountain biking or hitting the slopes. This tough and rugged case has turned my smart phone into a mountable action case. Really easy to use!
Exactly what we needed and works great!
So cute.....  I get compliments... It's super soft.... Doesn't really protect your phone if you drop it...
Came in today was brand-new and is the newer type with the flange thank you so much male type  The one in the picture the older one I will try to put a picture up but the new one has the flange it's not all flat like the one in the picture we just got 4 of them in and they were the right ones. New style better thank you so much<br /><br /> We use the  antenna for short distance not long-distance the antenna works well this and made for short distance it is not a long-distance. we use it around the family for short distances...  Thank you for the product .  We have no problems with this product.  If anything changes will update
Super fast ! Excellent product
Easy to charge watch and looks nice too
"Great little speaker with a powerful sound especially for the cost.  The only thing I'd like more is if it had a longer battery life before needed to be recharged.  Overall, I'm very satisfied."
"[[VIDEOID:543e99d2c8200fc8a74415450499712e]]I got this stereo for my husband's truck (1997 T-100) because he was LONG overdue for a stereo in there. His was garbage. For the price, this stereo has a LOT of bang for your buck! This is the first touch-screen stereo we've ever owned and it was a lot of fun to play with for the first time. It's got tons of great features. My husband can easily pair his phone's wifi to the system and play whatever he's got on it or use it for hands-free calling(always a plus, safety first!!), or use the av aux input jacks in the back to connect his ipod. It has a cd AND dvd player! That was a HUGE plus for us. My husband likes the option to be able to watch a movie in his truck while at work. The resolution is good and it's got a nice picture. The touchscreen makes it easy to navigate, simple interface, extremely user friendly. It was a volume knob which is a plus. It's easy to turn up or down while driving without taking your eyes off the road. It also has a remote control, which is neat, but I am just hoping my husband doesn't lose it as it's somewhat small. I will probably install Velcro on it so that'll attach to the dash. I like everything about it other then one thing, I wish it had an aux input in the front. But, that's not a deal breaker for us at all. Just a small inconvenience. I highly recommend this system. Just make sure you know whether your car is a double din before ordering. I wanted this system in my 200 Cadillac Escalade, but I was bummed to be informed by my husband that it's a 1.5 din. so I would have to do some modifications. I was bummed! Oh well. My husband is happy with it and it's perfect for him and his truck! I would definitely recommend this double din touchscreen stereo by Pyle!<br /><br />(I was thrilled we were offered the opportunity to purchase this stereo for our use and evaluation at a reduced, promotional price in exchange for our honest and unbiased review)"
Color had more yellow undertones than the blues/teals pictured
"Its very beautiful!  I have an unusually  slim area for a a license plate frame, I need a plate very very thin to get behind the back up camera on Toyota Camry (2014) and PA plates are big too, so double whammy, this fit beautifully!! Very happy with t he frames, you get 2, thats a deal, really!  If they tarnish or rust I will change my post.. so far, they are great!  Worth the wait!...well its been a few months and I have noticed some brownish looking, could be some tarnish, on a few rows of the crystals.. I will wash car again to see if this is dirt, but right now, that is making me wonder??? will update again if I am wrong..........Update, this beautiful plate does indeed TARNISH!!!! Wont buy again,dont recommend, sorry.. its all tarnished,I never go thru car washes,either, I wash my car by hand....very disappointed that its all tarnished...Update 04/02/16..HI, I have to say the seller is very attentive about trying to fix the disappointment I have had with my tarnished plates...they are very beautiful, but in a few months, mine did start to tarnish and now they are all tarnished with yellowish especially behind the crystals, but it is tarnished all over, the seller, will be sending me new ones and I will update again in the future, they are very good people to deal with and have bent over backwards for me, and I do appreciate that, hence the 4 stars....kudos to the seller..they do care.."
Doesn't work right
I wrote a review before saying it was great purchase but it was too early. The screen keeps going black all the time. Bad purchase don't not buy.
Very nice.
Exactly what I was looking for. Seller was great! Thank you!
I have a Galexy S5 with a slim case on it and it fits but its a snug fit. Perfect for going out. My strap broke the first time but I just replaced it with a different strap. works great. I would buy it agian.
"The cover under the plastic purple is a little loose on the phone, almost as if it's too big. Yet to see if this causes any problems, or is more just an annoyance."
Bought it for my wife and she loves to be able to use her phone even if she forgets to charge it.
It doesn't work in my car.  It was the dumbest purchase on Amazon
"I'm changing my review because though the color is somewhat off, this is a very protective case. A SUV ran my phone over while it was in this case and my phone survived and the case was only slightly scratched"
works great
"Although I was really nervous about how well the whole thing would turn out, I have to say that it was really simple and worked flawlessly. The screen feels so real, almost as though it didn't have a protector on it."
"Looks a little different when your phone isn't white, but still cute!"
"Fits perfectly. Saved my iPhone from getting damaged quite few times, forcing me to keep using.<br />Though the case is a lot slippery i liked it more than the leather one I bought at Apple Store.<br />Looks not compromised.<br />Phone feels lot slimmer. No weight added.<br />Overall great case :)"
Great item. Holds my IPhone 6 with a case.
Very good car phone magnet all round.
"Cute, cute, and perfect for the 7&#34; tablet I ordered to go in it!"
very useful，20 words 20 words 20 words 20 words 20 words 20 words 20 words 20 words 20 words 20 words 20 words
These cords Worked for about 3 days then said &#34;not compatible with iPhone&#34; and haven't worked since then. Great size and cute but won't work with iPhone so they don't do me any good.
Quality wasn't as good as I expected
"I bought this about a year ago. I was initially reluctant to keep it as it seemed Mickey Mouse and fragile. But, what the hell. This was not a cheap holder in terms of price. Well yesterday my initial impression was verified. While driving along the flimsy right phone holder arm broke. I did not even hit a bump. Just driving along and suddenly my phone is in the floor. Evidently the only way this will perform is as a subscription product where you buy a replacement on an annual basis. Don't buy."
Wore out over time and the white faded but overall good case. Had drop protection unlike other wallet cases.
"ordered for colleague in West Africa, he seems to be enjoying it"
"works great, and provides enough power for everything I power with it."
Works fine
Not the most durable that's for sure.  The medal around it is thin and bends out of shape easily.
At first the case looks and feels great. After a few months the poor craftsmanship starts showing.
Cheap and good
Braide cables are fabulous. I'm glad I found Anker products!!!!!!
Can't beat the product and price!
Great protector.  Fit as advertised.  Customer service checked in to make sure I was very satisfied.  I am.
Fits and protects peferctly
I had such high hopes for this cell phone case!  I was so excited to get it in the mail but was a tad bit disappointed when I took it out of the package.  The white back part is just a sticker of some sort and looks kind of cheap.  If it gets wet at any point in time I am sure that it is going to fall off and get gross...  There is a film on the  white that you need to peel off to make the white look shiny.<br />It is a nice case and I will keep it on my phone because there isn't many colorful cute cases out there right now for the edge.<br />I received this product at a discounted price for my honest review.
Easiest repair I ever did. No instructions needed.
"Loved it, I just wish it had some kind of preservative on the wood. It fit nice and sleekly, and I got great compliments on it. The camera and controls were easy reachable and there was no interference. I would have given it 5 stars if it had the aforementioned stain or something on the wood."
Perfect fit
Did not realize how much I would use this product. I never leave home without it. Taking pictures all day drains the battery fairly quick on my Lumia Icon but having power bank with me I never have to worry about it. Very happy with the purchase. Thinking this might make a good gift during the holiday season for the family.
"Sleek and beautifully designed. I'm traveling overseas and want to bring along extra charge power. I've charged it, but not yet used it to charge my phone."
"I love the concept of this charger, but unfortunately it just doesn't work very well.  I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and it just doesn't do the job it's intended to.  The charger is VERY position critical.  Your phone has to be just right on the charger otherwise it starts with the flashing lights and stops charging.  It charges just fine when the phone is positioned correctly, but the second issue is that it doesn't stay where you put it.  Any amount of vibration seem to allow the phone to slide down the face of the charger and move out of position.  I should have known that when they had a protective plastic sheet over the sticky rubber where the phone sits that there could be a problem.  I cleaned the rubber with a lint free cloth and water and didn't seem to help.  In the time I have been typing this review, my phone has slid off the sweet spot and stopped charging.  I am not jumping up and down on my keyboard.  My desk is not a board on a pillow.  I would have given this 2 stars since it does technically work, but when I come back after a couple of hours, expect to find my phone with a useful amount of charge only to find it has gone in to power saving mode just doesn't cut it.  I will be returning this charger and getting a 3 coil stand with a shelf for my phone to sit on.<br /><br />Best regards,<br />RH"
"I was accepted to review this case. I was going to give this as a gift. However the code didn't work. I emailed the seller, and still nothing."
Works great in both our cars. Adjustable for different vents. I can see the screen when using my GPS and its hands free.
"buttons work fine, sound is great with it."
"Great product, easy to use."
"Great product and easy instruction, crystal clear screen"
I love the look and how easy it was to put on and take off of my phone. I have had this style of case previously. However this one seems SO flimsy that I don't feel like it is protective at all against drops. So I'm using a different one.
"My husband loves these shoes. I first purchased the orange/black ones and he liked them so much I got him the blue ones too. The blue color is super sharp, very vibrant and he gets compliments on them often. They fit true to size, he wears 10.5 in Adidas and an 11 in Nike. He says they are super light and feel like he's not even wearing shoes. I will likely buy him another pair of the blue ones to have for the future."
"Headset works perfectly for my needs. Sound quality is good. Earbuds fit comfortably in my ears, but do not always stay in place. I love the remote control/mic. I listen to audiobooks while I walk my dog and while I am doing laundry or housework, the remote makes it easy to pause/play or take a call without having to take my phone out of my bag. Also included was a nice little zipper case to store the headset in."
They were okay brought for my granddaughter she liked them
Ok
Worked like a charm.
Just as described
Love the cover and the fact that it has a magnetic closure. Seems to hold up to wear and tear.
"Very nice cable. It's very sturdy, not brittle like the other brand's i've had in the past."
I love love love this solar charger! The thing about smart phones is that they use a lot of battery power.
The case looked good but it was only one week till it started to tear the belt clip
Nice little 4G phone
Great price for this charger. Product was as advertised. Works well with my iphone. Fast shipping. I will recommend this charger to my iphone friends Thanks again!
A great product which i already have one for my grandchild which he loves it. tks again
It worked for 3 weeks it the second one first one did not work at all
"This case is perfect when you need to streamline your purse, and yet need essentials, such as bank card(s), cash, etc."
"Love this, brought it on vacation and was able to charge multiple phones easily. Not too heavy, would definitely recommend!"
Delivered as promised...on time!
Great for my Desk. Really like it.
"Constantly says out of range, even when the phone is right next to the headphones."
"Great case. Fit perfectly on my phone, shipped fast and is very rugged without making it too bulky."
works great.
"Good product, highly recommended"
Love the feel of the case and super cute on my phone!
"Nice product, I don't use the credit card holder so no concerns with scratching.  Fits the phone well and all the buttons are easy to access.  Only four of five because the front cover feels cheep and is already starting to wear, but acceptable since it was so cheap."
Works great. Charges our phones and tablet very fast.
Very good.  It strongly attacks to the surface you nedd and offers a perfect grip for your gps or any other device.
Really good sound. I use this in my office and it is a great buy for the money.
"Excelent product, best price"
"I instantly loved the look of these headphones! They’re very modern looking and different. I was looking for a lightweight, sleek alternative to getting my headphone cable yanked out anytime I caught it on something at the gym. These did the trick and they're incredibly comfortable. Sound quality isn’t generally high on my list of demands, especially since I have cats and can’t have nice things. But I was pleasantly surprised at how good these sounded on top of everything."
Very good
Product was exactly as described!
Didn't fit my phone but seller was very accomodating.
This product is like the original usb cable from samsung. Fast and reliable charging. Highly recommended.
Received the phone it had a mark on the screen it's steadily getting worse and that whole spot is unusable the touch screen doesn't work in that spot I have photos. I know this is a refurbished phone but it said it was acceptable and usable this phone is neither of those things. I would like a replacement or at the very least a refund.
Works great
hard to get phone out when need to use it
excellent
Worth it. Everyone needs this!
stays clean longer and easier to clean than the plastic that  I used before. Easy to apply.
I love it
Great product
This is not nearly as low profile as the picture seems.  It think it would sit 4 inches above the handle bar.  I ordered a different product and sent this back.
"Nice color, good grip. Not sure how much protection it adds, but it seems to be adding some protection at least even though it's rather thin."
works as advertised both vertically and horizontally.  Does not have the rotating plastic clip which I have &#34;snapped off&#34; of previous  several cases.<br />holsters galaxy note 4 in otterbox  defender case.
Fits like a glove. Spigen always a great product.  Enhances the beauty of the Samsung s6 edge plus.  Barely adds any addition weight to the phone.  I loved It!
Going strong
"Great Selfie Stick I definitely recommend it. I take selfies every day with my friends and family, I will surely but another one for my Girlfriend. This Selfie Stick is easy to use and light-weighted. It is easy to carry anywhere with its compact size and is compatible with either iPhone or any other cell phone."
love this the letter feels amazing had it for 2 years now and still looks as good as it does when I got it now if not better than
Works great!
It was broken in the first week... It is not a good material
Wonderful case...convenient
The worse i've bought ever
"Nice and convenient when multiple people in the car need to charge and they're all different types of devices. (i-phone, droid, tablet, etc)"
Super fast delivery! Quality is amazing! It feels so good holding it in my hands!
Worked great in a 2000 ford windstar the pocket works good to store the aux cable when not in use.
"This was OK at first, but after 4-5 uses of 1-2 hours each, the right ear bud does not work. I really expected a better build quality from these. My kids' wired earbuds from the dollar store have lasted longer."
It works great!
"This mount is simple, portable and sturdy and well built. Its highly adjustable and I consider it to be a very good product for the money! It clips on and is very tight so it does not fall off. I use it for my iPhone 6 and move it between 2 vehicles and a boat."
very nice product would buy again
Ueless to me....I have a 2000 Buick LeSaber
Good quality
"I have been use it for a year already ,comfortable for watch movie!"
Product arrived promptly and in great shape.  Easy to install and does a good job protecting my screen.  Thanks!
Excellent!!! The best cutter !!
"Everything fine, nice & useful as expected & good delivery service..."
"Arrived as promised, love it, great case and the shatter proof glass worked great, real easy to apply!"
I have bought two other portable chargers to give my phone that little boost of power needed on long trips And this unit has easily done the job!
"Does what it should, quick charges my phone. Better priced then the OEM quick charger"
"Cool little bit here. I wanted a line driver (a signal booster) for my low powered home stereo (ok fine it's a wimpy tube amp if you must know (see my other review)) to get more volume. It gave me a bit more before clipping, but enough to make a noticeable difference. But it got better. It allowed me to use its aux input to run my Iphone into it so I could have 2 inputs going into said stereo. But it got better. It also has sub outputs so I could hook up a sub with said stereo. But it got better. It has 2 outputs besides the sub so I could also run my (2) inputs into another (solid state) amp. All this and I haven't even touched the equalizer settings...and probably won't. Get a power adapter for home use (see my other review) and you've got a $70 home equalizer that is compact, maximizes your amp's capabilities, and acts as a dual input and dual output switch plus allows a sub hookup via RCA interconnect. It's almost like they designed this just for my foolish stereo setup. I do get a bit more hiss/noise with this on at high volumes noticeable with no tunes playing, thus minus one star...but if I can trace that to the RCAs I would say 5 stars. Knobs are hard to reach, especially the master volume, which I wish they had placed all the way on the left instead of one in (the sub is all the way left). Like I said, pretty cool bit for the dough."
"I like this charger. It is a good length, light weight, easy to use, no problem plugging it in. It seems to me that it charges faster than the OEM. Very good product."
"I loved these,  they worked great for workouts;  them just after the 30 day return window closed on August 18th, they no longer turn on.  When plugged in,  they show full charge but they will no longer turn on.  This sucks  :-("
I have been trying to find the right light weight phone case that is also sturdy. This case is exactly what I wanted. It is slim to the phone and has a sturdiness to it that I am not afraid it is going to just peel off or break. I like the see through back because I can put pictures in the case and have a thousand different cases in one. It is made of a premium material. I will be using this phone case a lot. Especially when I have meetings to go to. My regular bulky case isn't to professional. I also love that it comes with a screen protector.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a review.
"I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE ITEMS THAT I BOUGHT,GOOD PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH,FAST DELIVERY,GREAT PRODUCTS.<br /> DEFENTLEY 5 STARS."
Love it.  Great quality. Shipping was fast too
"Does the job nicely - keps the phone dry, and hangs around the neck while out on the kayak - bright enough to use as a signaling device if necessary. Well made."
Nice price on a nice shield. It was easy to install. Still going strong after about a year.
This case fit perfectly and it was easy to put on. I love it.
Husband loves if.
Super cute case just lost a few stones after a few months of use. not bad as I am hard on phones.
"I had thought these were going to be great chargers for our phones and tablet.  They aren't that great. I'm disappointed with them. They just don't charge or they charge mega slow. But for the price I paid, I guess I can't complain. I will say this though, delivery was fast and efficient."
"As other have said, really amazing quality and almost unbelievable that it costs so little. The arm and table clip are very sturdy and would hold up the heaviest phone completely extended. Suction cup is very strong, too. I have it mounted to a piece of smooth plastic taped to my desk. The device clip opens to a generous size and holds a Samsung S4 comfortably, could probably fit a bigger phone but definitely not a tablet."
"Really protects your phone, and will fit comfortably in your pocket"
"It worked for two weeks then it would not ring when a call came in.  Tried adjusting settings it did nothing to help then in the third week the 1,2,3 keys all stopped working.  This rendered the phone useless."
"This is one of my favorite Trent cases. The design is slim but robust and slides into pockets very easily. The back rubber is very shock resistant. For a non-waterproof case, it does a good job at repelling dust."
Great phone
"I would recommend this product to my family and friends. It have been used almost 4 weeks with no problems and it charged very fast. I am very happy with the product, very good price and quality. I will buy it again from the company."
"This is a great phone, truly, for the price. Need little work on the configuration. I am using H2o 4G LTE network."
Both of these cases did NOT fit the 5S at all.  While pretty and detailed these just did NOT work.  You can NOT get them to snap shut.
All broken in 2 weeks
Beautiful sturdy case.
"Said it would fit my phone, but my phone was too big to fit in it. Disappointed."
FYI: I wear a size 10 and these are a bit loose.  Should be perfect when I add a gel insole.
love it
This S6 Edge charger case works good. I would recommend this case. It does take a little longer to charge then I thought it would but most phones charge faster when directly connected to there own charger. I did receive delivery more the two weeks before they said it would be delivered.
"Keeping in mind the price point of this pair of inexpensive Brainwavz Jive in-earphones, and comparing it with the in-ears' positive attributes, I can easily give it a five star rating:  Well-balanced sound, with decent vocals and instruments;  a very comfortable fit; lightweight housing;  gold-plated audio plug-in; a mic that works flawlessly and conveys your words crisply and clearly; nicely pliable, low memory cables; a classy look--with three color choices; four pairs of tips, (including a pair of Comply); and a nice, zippered, hard carry case (that other companies sell, similar but smaller, for ten bucks).<br /><br />Sound is easy on the ears:  Dynamic and energetic; (Brainwavz calls it &#34;lively&#34; and that is a good description.)  The sound is not muddy, flat or congested.  There is decent definition/resolution, good range, and a definite stereo effect.<br /><br />What you need to accept for this price point:  The sound engineers had to make concessions somewhere:  Bass is not booming (and that is not necessarily a bad thing depending on your point of view), and sound is not as rich and full as you get with more expensive in-ears.  Some depth is lost, but details are there.  Sound is somewhat &#34;laid-back&#34;, like it is coming from a bit of a distance.<br /><br />Of note:  Ear tip color match the color of the in-ears and cable, and I kinda' like that; (Comply ear tips are the usual black).  Cable is thicker below the mic, thinner above the mic, to lighten the comfortable feel even more, and I like that feature, too.  Brainwavz has re-designed their zippered, hard case by making it more oblong, instead of squarish.  It means you don't have to roll your cable so tightly and it is easier and quicker to fit it all back in.<br /><br />I chose the red and I'm very happy with that color.  It is a rich red on the metal housing--I might call it &#34;lipstick red&#34;.  The tips are a matching translucent red, and the cables are more of a deeper red to red/brown color.  Really nice looking, not garish at all.<br /><br />*I received a free sample product from Brainwavz.n color.  Really nice looking, not garish at all.<br /><br />*I received a free sample product from Brainwavz."
"These cables have a tendency to separate where the adapter fits onto the cable itself, though I suppose they aren't much worse than most other cables. I've replaced two of them now, but for the price, I don't mind it much. They're long and they work well, all things considered."
Saved my phone
The joysticks don't work properly. They have a dead spot and the timing is off!
Perfect fit and just the right amount of minimal protection that I wanted.
"I haven't hooked it up yet, but if I'm to go by the brand, it definitely seems promising!"
Love this wallet! Holds many credit cards and phone nicely. Room left for paper money as well.  Magnetic clip closure works great.  Nice find!
Perfect for the upgrade I needed.
Love it
"Bought this for my husband, who always had tangled ears cords. Now.. not so much ( as he only, puts one ear piece in his ear. The other one is tangled, but wrapped up and away). Happy with this simple solution to tangled cords."
cute little case
REALLY NICE FOR THE PRICE
Even better than I expected
"Pos! Would not support iphone 6 anymore after owning it since November, suppose to have 1 year warranty, when I called customer service he told me they would do a one time exception and refund it (excuse me but what about my warranty).  Will never buy this again and they should stand by their products! Wish I could give the whole experience a zero"
"They aren't as well made as the others I have bought, but for the price, they are great. I can afford to use them for a while and throw them away."
"Love Romero Britto products specially in Amazon, prices are very good"
This case is durable without being too bulky. Most of the ports are easy to get to except for your mute slider. It's not too hard for me because I'm a female with small fingers but for a guy or someone with larger hands I could see this being hard to get to.<br /><br />Otherwise I have zero complaints and really love this case! One of my favorites!<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.
Doesn't fit the screen and wont stick to the contour of the actual screen
"I love it, just ordered a new one today."
Nice case very tough I would recommend it
This item worked great...once!  When I used it again (after the return period had expired)...it would no longer hold a charge...or is not fully recharging even though the lights indicate it is has completed charging.  Garbage!!!
Wrong product to expensive to send back
This little case is still around and in good shape. I purchased this almost over a year ago and am just now posting a review but the case is still in tact and in great shape. Thanks for a good quality product!
"Ports seem a bit tighter than the stock part, but they work just as well. Installation was fairly easy by watching videos on YouTube. Just be careful when removing the screen. I wasn't as careful as I should have been and it seems as though I may have damaged some of the ribbon cables - now my home button doesn't work and there are horizontal lines running through the screen. But now my phone charges so at least I can use it. By using jailbreak/Activator I have been able to get around the home button issue."
"I was pleasantly surprised that the case looks better in person than in the picture.  It's easy to attach, easy to find in my purse and I'm enjoying the compliments."
Great
"Purchased for my Samsung Galaxy S4 and it arrived yesterday.  It charges quickly has a very clear display. Nice design but you need to push the spring loaded adjuster (right side of battery) mechanism all the way out and it creates a ton of resistance on the springs. The plastic cover feels like it's going to snap off. If they would have designed it 2 mm wider this wouldn't be a concern.  If you don't have a wide battery, I would give this serious consideration. Pic posted for S4 owners with OEM battery.   I'll post back after a few months or when it breaks :-)"
"I love it!!! You can answer calls, sync to all apps, monitor sleep activity and physical activity....it's awesome!"
"Awesome cover.  I got this for my 13year old for Iphone 5s.  For myself I am a HTC fan and have had cases for HTC M7 and M8.  SPECK is the only phone cover I will ever buy.  If SPECK doesn't make a cover for the phone, I'm not buying the phone is how strong I feel about the quality of SPECK covers.  The phone honestly will bounce with the cover on, without doing any damage to the phone.  It has a slight lip that is slightly higher than the glass so not matter how the phone falls the phone is protected.'<br /><br />The color in the picture is the color of the case that we received.

They work well
Looks good. Blue tooth is very good
You can take this anywhere and do whatever you want to it and its performance doesn't change. It's much smaller than I thought it would be but it packs a punch. Definitely a great speaker with easy connection.
Not dust proof. Not well made. Noticed plastic near buttons was giving way within a month. Ripped totally off in three months of typical use. Tons of dust gets behind and makes the see through back a terrible idea unless you like seeing the dirt smudged on your phone.
"Does its job, costs basically nothing. Good product."
Holds my phone while I run. Does what it's supposed to do
"The new Droid 4 phone works fine. I did not receive a SIM card with this order, so I used the one on my old phone Droid 4."
good product
"The case and the holder are outstanding. Everything has worked out as advertised.<br />I am very satisfied with the service, as I received it two days, after I ordered it."
I absolutely love my vivo fit 2. It makes me more mindful of the exercise I do during my day. I love seeing the calories I burn. Such an insentive.
Very durable
Late
"Great value, soft and have a nice grip.  Fits my phone well.  The only thing I hoped was the option to chose one color if I wanted with a  cheaper price.  I definitely didn't need this many cases..."
stylus  doesn't fit in note 4 opening
"I wanted to love this, as my Galaxy S4 eats battery power.  I get less than a day of use, so the prospect of doubling my battery life was appealing.  With this PowerSkin installed, I now get a day of use without charging, which is an improvement. The trade-off is, the sacrifice of some protection.<br /><br />This unit uses an interesting approach.  As you can see from the photo, the extended battery itself is not attached to the PowerSkin.  You use this battery in place of your normal battery in the phone, then the normal battery piggybacks on this one, essentially creating a double-thick battery.  Then, you push the phone into the back cover (it will sort of click into place). Last, add the side cover bumper over the front of the phone and click it together.<br /><br />The pros of the approach are that the case adds minimal size to the phone. With every other power case I've had (granted, they have all been for iPhones), the phone slides into the case, where you push the cable connection into a built-in plug and the case has its own cable connection point.  This means that those cases are not only thicker than the phone, but add about a half inch to the length because of the plug.  This PowerSkin adds very little length, and you keep the original cable connection, which is nice.  Also, with most other cases, you have to manually activate the battery backup, usually after your main battery discharges.  With the PowerSkin, the extra battery essentially becomes part of the regular battery, creating a 5200 mAh battery instead of the standard .  There is nothing to activate; the extra power is just always there.  I don't really know how the batteries discharge (i.e., if one goes, then the other, or both at the same time), I just know there is more power.<br /><br />The cons to this are the case itself.  The separate bumper is plastic, which I feel may end up breaking too soon. When it's all put together, if you squeeze the sides of the phone, you feel the bumper flexingin and out.  Also, the back does not fully click into the bumper; it's too tight. If you look at the pictures, two of the corners have a little gap, where I could not get the tabs to fully click together.  If you do click them together, something else unclicks.  The case itself has not come undone, but there is that small gap where it is not clicked together.  Also, the whole case is a smooth plastic, not grippy.  If it got wet, or your hands were sweating, it would be slippery.  Since there is not a screen protector, you need to be careful not to drop the phone.  The case this replaces was an Otterbox, which was both grippy and had a screen protector.<br /><br />For less than 16 bucks, this is a good deal if you need the extra power to make it through your day.  I do like the fact that it gives you more battery life and does not make the phone any longer.  But, I think it could be improved.  Even at a higher price, say 26 bucks, adding a grippier rubber-like surface (like the Otterbox) and adding a screen protector to the side bumper, would make this a fantastic case, that protects your phone well and gives great battery life. I give this 3.5 stars (but Amazon makes me round to a whole number).<br /><br />I was provided a unit for an honest review."
"Very nice case, but clasp magnetic not strong enough to handle my cc additive and money.  Had to return, but sorry to have to do so."
"It's an okay phone.  It doesn't ring loud, I constantly miss calls. The availability of storage is crappy. Would only recommend for a 1st phone for a child."
Fell apart within two weeks
"Fits perfectly and looks better than the picture, love it!"
"Works great so far, It's much higher quality than I was expecting for the money and having the second battery and external charger  is great for travel, it gives me two days of use without  needing to locate a charger."
"Worked fine. Eventually battery life dwindled, just like the the oem battery. Solid inexpensive replacement."
Item is junk. Broke in 4 days. Do not buy
I got it early then it said I would get it and it works really good
Ok
Couldn't get this case on to save my life!!
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
A very good product! My wife and I both have one and we are very happy with them.
The device is good. I like it.
I really expected better from the Amazon name. The sheathing cracked and separated from the wires at the lightning connection end within a couple of weeks. Very disappointed.
This band is ok. Decent quality. Received it in black as a gift. My GF bought it when they were priced under $10. Has had price hikes 2-3 times since. Not bad for the price but it's getting more expensive which lessens that &#34;pro&#34;.
"Easy to install, good sound quality. The SD card is a nice feature (I was able to move my songs from my Garmin GPS)."
Hasn't broken on me and they offer a lifetime guarantee so far I'm happy with them
Poor design and implementation. AVOID buying. Weak voice recognition. It usually gets it wrong. Navigation screens confusing. Updates far and few between. Newest map is six months old before it is issued and already 1 year out of date. Outdone by a $40 TomTom
"Decent case at first. Relatively thin for a case with a stand, good shock protection.<br />Case stand broke within a few months of buying it just from normal usage, sorta just have it taped down so the stand doesn't just flop out constantly now.<br />Rather flimsy stand to begin with."
Easy to apply and was what I expected
Took it with me to EDC! It's a great buy!
good for price
It's hard to find a Bluetooth headset that sounds good when having a phone conversation. I've tried several different headsets and this one is the best. My friends are no longer upset when I use Bluetooth because the quality is so good.<br />I wish music could sound a little beter but the phone callsare more important and th quality is great there.
This tripod adapter fits my iPhone 6 plus with the Otterbox Commuter case with no room to spare but it does fit securely. The product keeps my phone in place while on my Gorilla pos and other tripods. The Bluetooth remote paired easily with my iPhone and it came in very handy when starting and stopping videos and shooting photos.
"This phone=Amazing!!<br />I am a huge android fan and have used so many phones. From the notes, to the motos and other budget friendly devices. This device simplifies things such as hardware but takes no short cuts to create a balanced priced phone for the manufacturer. I am amazed at how Mich bang you get for your buck here.<br />To combat common complaints I would say: I got this phone not to long ago. it does have &#34;bloatware&#34; however between having 4 gbs of RAM , a convenient clear cache button in the notification shade and the auto start app manager, my phone is always snappy. Sure there are a lot of preloaded apps. Root and uninstall the ones you want to. However, 64 GB and expandable storage being an option these apps make little difference in performance or memory.<br />The camera is good enough. It is a mobile smartphone camera. People expect to much in this category. All photos look blurry until you tap the screen to focus in on what it is your taking a picture of. HDR mode is freaking amazing. They have a sleep of filters and optimizations depending on what kind of photo your taking or scene your in.<br />Battery life is good. I have no problem with my unit. It takes 4 hours of on screen usage to kill it but it will easily last all day with moderate usage. When you do use it heavily and drain it the quich charger will have you back at it in no time.<br />The UI (look of the software) I have mixed feelings about. The folder organization for all apps I don't find useful. But as a disclaimer I am used to a stock app drawer experience. Alphabetically ordered. Double tap the screen while off to wake up is awesome and convenient since the lock screen button is all the way on the top of the device. You can draw a C while the screen is off to auto launch the camera or even double tap volume up. This makes it easy to access the camera when your trying to capture something quickly. Especially handy if you have kid. I put a third party launcher on my device because I am not a huge fan of the look of the default one. The notification shade is a bit much but with some theme options you can improve it somewhat.<br />The screen is nice and you can manually change the balance and color saturation. In my opinion all devices should have this because color temperature us off on a lot of phones out there. This has a realistic color saturation but for someone like me who prefers saturated displays just switch it to vivid mode in the display settings.<br />The only thing I can find I do not like about this phone is the hardware keys are not back lit. This however is not a big deal.<br /><br />Conclusion is if your looking at this phone, then buy it. Best bang for your buck period.  It has many flagship features. The four gigs of RAM are a welcome sight to power users and I feel like a cool guy having an Intel in my phone. The cameras are great with many great manual features. The volume rocker on the back I have lived ever since LG did it and it makes a slight difference I welcome. Battery life is good and the included fast charger just makes the battery experience terrific. The 64 GB memory is enough plus you have expandable storage. I have 5 games over 2 gbs on it, all my music downloaded, all my podcasts, and all my books and a hundred plus apps and have only touch 20 of the GB. I have a lot of stuff on here.<br />GET THIS PHONE!!!"
Buy this if you want protection for your phone.
charges to 51% now no matter how long. slow. At first it would charge to 97% but it just kept going down
good
It doesn't work for my phone...and that sucks a waste of money and waiting on it to come in the mail..
"Fit was great in my BMW 328i center console.  I had tried other models which did not allow me to close the console, this fit and works great."
Good for the price you pay.
"Finally, a GPS mount that really works !"
This was clearly a magpul fake.. Had I known it was coming straight from China I would not have wasted my money
I like the case but the belt clip broke the first 5 minutes.  Fortunately Amazon and the Mfr refunded my purchase.
I bought this for a friens who wanted one to fit their ipod. So once i got i gave it tto the friend and it perfectly fit the ipod and was easy to put on. My friend was said it was easy to put on the arm and easy to adjust it too. This armband does fit an ipod perfectly well so that is good to know for those who have ipods and are looking for an armband to use with it when you are running and walking. Very well made and does seem like it will last for a while to come.
"So far, so good. Works as advertised, great price."
"Almost perfect except it arrived cracked.  Because it is clear, it isn't too noticeable, but it was kinda disappointing."
Great charger.. This is the third anker charger I've bought for myself and 5th over all.. Great capacity and best price I found. I like that I only have to recharge it once a week and use it throughout the week as needed.. Would definitely recommend
This cover is such a great color.. too bad that it's not the same as the waterproof back that comes on the phone originally... I have to make sure my phone doesn't get wet with this back cover on. Still does everything it's supposed to
Great case.  It is like my others for Samsung phones but this one fits better for some reason on the small HTC Incredible (Verizon).
worked perfectly
Great
Product as described with good instructions and easy application.
Awesome!
"The magnet on this case is so weak that when I dropped the phone, the case whipped open on the way down and the phone landed on the sidewalk glass-down and smashed.  Plus it was never that great to start with, it looked worn after just a few uses.  Please do not buy this case if you are relying on it to protect your phone."
Great product! Charges quickly and for someone like me who is always in a hurry and always on the go Who doesn't have a lot of time to wait or waste.  And I lose a lot of chargers and cords.  Sometimes they grow legs and disappear.  I will Buy this product again in the near future.
"It was perfect for what I was looking for.  Not too large to be bulky, but sizeable enough to give protecion."
Good case good price
Keep the pone very slim - great color - simple and minimalistic which is good. Good feel on the case (doesn't feel slippery). Protects the sides and the back. Buttons are exposed and so is screen so may have issues there - but not too bad and you can always just get a screen protector. Professional packaging as well.
"I love this solar charger. Not only is it very useful but it is super cool. It is well made, thick and sturdy. Everyone wants to know about it and how it works. "
"Terrible, Horrible and a total waste of money... I purchased these for my husband who is in his mid 50's ... Daily activity is walking the dog both morning and evening whilst listening to music.... He complained that the sound is not great quality but it's ok because he plays it low enough to hear his surroundings... The quality of the product felt firm when removed from the package..The problem is the ear hooks, which, from after two weeks usage, started becoming loose and falling off... Due to the design, with the connecting cable.. my husband was very careful with these headphones.<br />It appears as if the weight of the headset was too much for the hooks, or the way the hooks sre connected should be improved... Now I have to purchase him another bluetooth headset ...."
"Excellent product.  Absolutely love how easy it is, to snap it on.  Holds my Samsung Note 3 really well.  Was so happy with the product, that I bought another one within a few days, for my wife."
"I love my Misfit. I wear it every day and usually sleep with it on. I get compliments on it because it looks more like jewelry than a fitness tracker, which was my purpose for choosing it! I knew i would be more likely to wear it if it was cute rather than chunky and ugly, especially being in a corporate office all day. It works great, and I've only had to replace the battery once, which was in line with companies claims of battery life."
WORKS GREAT LOVE IT!
"Strap broke within a week, will retry to return it."
"I dropped my iPhone in a river this weekend, after searching for about 5-10 minutes for it I found it buried in the mud about 3ft below water. I was still panicking until I hit the home key and it turned on like nothing had happened. I've dropped this thing a couple times too without any damage to the phone. There are hairline fractures in the plastic but apparently they haven't compromised the watertightness of the case. Sooooo happy I put this case on my phone!"
Everything went perfectly fine
Does not work
"Good product. I drop my iPhone all the time, so far it has protected my phone about 20 times!!! Not bulky & not ugly to look at!"
i love my new marine tower speakers they are mounted on my jeep wrangler and they are super loud and clear!!! Thank you soo much
Works as advertised
Product as described.  Bluetooth hooks up to my cellphone for hands free driving.  This device actually attaches to the sun visor of your car.  So it is out of the way.  It is a little bit thick.
This isn't what I got in the mail! I specifically ordered the one without the window on the front. The one I got was very similar but has a plastic window on the front of the book case.<br />Also the one I received in the mail didn't have the small flap that comes over the side to hold closed.<br />The picture isn't right either. The color of the case is washed out blue! The one in the picture is very blue and the one I got is almost not even blue. The harder part of the case that is that baby blue that holds the phone it's self is blue in the picture. The one I got was black.<br />It wasn't what I ordered. I don't want to hassle with sending it back. I'm just going to give it away.
It is very nice I have used it a lot already. Took in a trip and used it more than once.<br />Only thing is that I have to put power to it to get total charge to unit.
Does exactly as stated.  My kids fight me for it.
Good product
"Bought one of these and this model for my husband because I already had one and liked its performance, for the most part.  Wish it had caller ID feature but can't have it all.  He likes it just fine; uses it mainly for driving.  Mine is attached to my ear it seems sometimes.  Thank you for a good product and a good price point."
Good
thanks
"Very convenient.  Best professional packaging I have seen in a long time.  I am very pleased with this product - it is clean, attractive and works beautifully!"
"Just beautiful!!! These are so pretty and handy!! I can carry my phone, credit cards, ID and cash and I dond have to carry anything else!!  Perfect!!!!  I received a discount on this item for an honest review."
"Thin, looks nice but not too durable I doubt"
Good quality and holds a long charge.  Used it on a trip recently and was so glad to have it.
I love this cable cord.  It works perfectly.  I use to charge my Samsung tablet and phone.  It gives me plenty of length to be able to charge and use my tablet and not be next to a wall.
works well.  Can charge my iPad as well as my phone on one charge.  Very handy to take on a trip.
Defective
"Awesome mount, excellent quality"
Made a great gift.
I love the color and it protects my phone from accidental dials.
Horrible
"I like this it works great and holds my IPhone 6 Plus however I think the phone is to heavy for the ball and socket connection as it is continuously falling forward, I am going to try to enlarge the ball by putting some electric tape around it as it is just loose enough that it is a nuisance when I am riding my bike, I would recommend it but be aware the ball and socket may not be strong enough to hold the larger phones up"
"Very nice size, and it can charge my phone up to 3 times."
EXCELENTE
Does not fit an IPhone 6 Lifeproof Case. Which is what I ordered it for. I will be returning the items.
"Arrived on time and as described. Great product, thank you so much!"
I received the product and not happy about it. I didn't receive the earpiece. What a waste of time.
This product far exceeded my expectations.  My phone remains in place while I am driving and using it as a GPS.  I would order another Arkon Friction Dash Smartphone Car Mount.  I own and radio and TV station and I am letting people know how satisfied I am with this product.
"Great film, it makes my phone look even better after applying"
"Solid product. I have a few different Anker cables, and none have let me down so far. The smaller form factor allowed this to work with my wifes Defender case which was a challenge for many cables."
Its already broken.
Perfect
Perfect fit!
"One of the handsets stopped working after using it 3 times. And I can't return it, not happy would not purchase again."
"I purchased this as a gift for my brother who just got an Apple watch in July. He loves it! Being a person who works with wood, he especially loved the wood look, very pretty. It works quite well and was well-priced on Amazon."
I've only dropped it once so far and it did a great job of protecting the phone.<br />Part of the reason why I have not dropped it more often is because the case has fantastic grip!
"Good product, highly recommended"
Just right
Garbage.
"Love the look and the idea, but the hard casing that fits over the soft bumper part did not stay attached on one corner. It just kept popping out. I finally just broke down and bought an Otter Box."
"it sounds good for music, and the microphone is very good for voice chat."
Doesnt work on my OnePlus 2 :(
"I fix iPhones as a little side job and recommend they buy your screens but lately I've been telling them different. Your screens come in perfect condition but the gram attached to the glass comes apart very easily and shows light coming from inside the phone. This can be frustrating because there is no way to attach the plastic back to the glass, please take this into consideration when making new screens."
I like these.  really good for working out.  no issues thus far.
My wife loves it. I think it's absurd.
I just got the cover and it looks exactly like the picture I really like but I think that after a few weeks this image is gonna peel off  maybe
"So far so good. It really is easy to get on if you have a steady hand. Mine is slightly more to one side but since nothing was affected by this I didn't try to take off n reapply. When you  lay it on the screen it immediately adheres. Absolutely no bubbles. That's how easy it is. Place it on and bam you're done. It doesn't wrap down the sides, it sits on top with a very very tiny space on either side. This allows you to use a case. I've got the incipeo ngp and the two together fit great. It feels great and the touch is perfect. It looks and feels like glass so the touch is smooth and the visual is totally clear with no distortion. I haven't dropped my phone so I don't know if it will protect the screen or not. I'm hopeful that if I do drop it, the Sir Lancelot will save the day."
Looks good and fits perfect. Just what I was looking for.
Picture scratches off
Good
"Great product, looks great & holds up very well"
Loved it!!!! Super Cute
I used to give this a 5 star.  I had one and loved it.  Finally it cracked when I dropped my phone on cement.  It was still a 5 star item as my phone was not damaged.  I then bought 3 more of these.  2 for an iPhone 5S and 1 for a 6 plus.  I could NOT get a single one of them to install and besides my previous cracked version I have installed older non-glass protectors as well.  All 3 are ruined.  I went to The Anker website but the form they have for problems is long and complicated including pictures.  Multiply that by 3 and it's just not worth the time.  Hence the one star review now.  A 25% success rate is not good.  That's too bad because I did like the protector.  Now I am using the protector that came with my Otterbox and my daughter has a non glass protector on hers.
So far so good. Hope it lasts
Fast and very accurate
I use it all the time for my GPS. Very useful. I like it.
There were sctraches on one side. Like it has been used for a year.
"I receive so many compliments and wonder that I am going to purchase another in another color.  It does make the phone slightly heavier, but well worth it."
My original review was that these batteries were junk....however because of my 1 star rating the folks from Anker contacted me and sent me a whole new kit  including 2 new batteries and a charger... They sent several emails and even called me to make sure that I was happy with the order....  they get a 5 star for customer service...however after testing the battery for a month now the only thing is ...it does not quite last as long as the OEM Samsung....
This is a nice case. I don't know if its drop safe but all together its nice and slim like i like it
"I absolutely love this case! It took me a day before I realized u could remove the phone from the wallet &that the case around the phone matched the pattern of the wallet. The magnets are strong &work great! There are 4 magnets that hold the phone case to the wallet. The wallet part is awesome, has multiple sections for $ etc. Even a spot for change! My ID &credit cards slide in &out when I need them nice&easy. The magnet that holds the phone&wallet shut is awesome! It never doesn't stay closed. My mom bought a similar but diff case for her phone &the magnet stopped working completely so it's always flopping off the side. Deff not a problem w/this one! The ONLY partially bad thing I can say about this case is that I had the wallet/case open &it fell off a table &my screen got a hair crack across it. It's not even noticeable tho as I didn't even realize it had cracked until the following day & i thought it was a piece of hair at 1st. This isn't even something that I blame on the case though seeing as how it isn't designed to be a protective type of case. I think if it had fallen with the case closed &the outer magnet had been secured, I don't believe it would've cracked from that fall. All that being said, I would absolutely recommend this case &I actually even wanted 2get another 1 in a diff design but there wasn't 1 I liked/wanted enough. I've pretty much stopped lugging around my heavy purse as well since I got this because it holds everything I need! The wrist strap is wonderful as well! Obviously I can't say enough about this purchase &deff don't regret it. Only regret is that I didn't make up my mind &buy it sooner!!"
fits well but not snug like I wish it did. Love the colors and look tho!
Love it! Just wish it would charge a little faster
"This phone did not meet my expectation, i was greatly disappointed."
Had the screenprotector for less than day and already cracked with barely hitting it.  I do not recommend this product whatsoever!!!
Did not work from day one.  Threw them in the garbage
"UPDATE 10/9/15 - I emailed Gear Beast Customer Service after they left a comment on this review.  They apologized for Amazon's old stock and offered to replace my arm band with no extra cost or effort on my part.  The replacement does support an iPhone 6 Plus comfortably.  I have updated my review from 2 Stars to 4 Stars and applaud the Customer Service I received from Gear Beast.  They definitely stand by their customers.  I saw reviewer complaints that the cutouts for the iPhone 6 Plus were on the wrong side, but I also saw the company reply to those comments saying the issue had been fixed.  The one that immediately comes to mind was dated October 2014.  Based on this, I purchased the item for my iPhone 6 Plus, assuming the issue was resolved.  Well, either the company lied about the issue being fixed, or I got some seriously old inventory.  My item, received July 2015, had the cutout on the wrong side.  The phone fits, but I have to leave the end flap open in order to plug in the headphones.  It works fine while walking (I just position the open flap facing upwards so the phone doesn't slip out the bottom), but I'm not sure if this will hold up to running.  Unfortunately, I discovered this too late to return the item.  I'm pretty disappointed that the company is still sending out defective products.  Item is otherwise comfortable, so I'll give it 2 stars for that alone."
"Super cute, super cheaply made"
First off can I just say how well fit this case is? Btw this is an honest and unbiased review. It's as if it was made during the production of the iPhone 6 Plus! It does not add any bulk at all in my opinion. The volume buttons and sleep button are easy to push that's why I say the case is definitely well made for this phone. I also like how the inside is lined with felt to protect from scratches. The soft feel on outside of case is very smooth but not slippery. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who needs protection but don't want a bulky case.  Maxboost customer service:  They are excellent. Very professional and if you have a problem they will solve it right away. Customer service is very important which is why I gave five stars.
"Hated the way it fit my Samsung Galaxy S3. It seemed to have a lot of wiggle room still.  My main complaint is that the case I received covered the flashlight and it was very hard to use the side buttons.  Plus the stand seemed very cheap,  broke within days so the stand kept popping out. I felt like my phone wasn't very safe in this as well. Wasn't good for my phone at all."
"Great price for a great product.  It arrived sooner than expected, and I am very satisfied."
"Nice band , great value."
Lovely case. I love that it's slim and has the shock absorption edges
"Love it,"
"Nice slim case but durable material. Has good coverage, extra protection on the corners, but is not bulky at all. Plus the blue dot design hides the flaws/scratches my last clear cover created (not by E LV) but still has clear look that I wanted. With new screen protector my phone looks brand new again!"
Light weight and thin. Kept the same light and thinness of phone. It came with white residue so it made the case look used.
"Great screen protector, I am very happy with the fit and the way it feels.  Everything is still crystal clear and the screen is much easier to clean!  I highly recommend the Anker glass screen protector!"
"Works as advertised. Charger can be used to recharge both batteries included, as well as the OEM battery that was originally in the Samsung Galaxy S5."
wasnt big enough
"This came with the stem mount for the RAM Mount I got for my motorcycle.<br /><br />While the mounting system from RAM Mounts is fantastic, this particular cell phone holder is a no go with the Iphone 6. It hits the volume or close button when in the proper position.<br /><br />It also has a wobble/rotation while in motion to the left and right.<br /><br />What I did to make it work was to purchase the QUAD LOCK system (universal mount with adhesive backing) and remove the arms and spring on this mount. I then stuck the QUAD LOCK onto it, and now I have a secure mount which fits onto my motorcycle, and I have purchased a Quad Lock for my car as well. Now it works fine.<br /><br />RAM has much better and more secure mounting solutions that are phone or device specific I suggest using those."
Awesome case! Love how it really secures the phone and has full coverage
Fast charge.
The item works fine I would go in another one .
This 5.5 is kicking no problem family member no complain everybody is happy I am happy thank you keep up the good work Mr blu
"Small, sleek charger that comes with a high quality cable. Looks great, and works great too. 5 stars."
"Good product, fast shipping"
Adjustable and comfortable. Once in a while it'll pinch my arm when I'm strapping it in. The key doesn't slip out which is great. The phone fits in the case and the opening holes match up for the iPhone ear phones quite well.
It fits my s5 perfect.you do have to take it out of the case to charge it.it is water tight.took it to the beach this weekend and no sand or ocean moisture  got inside the case.
great item
"Case fit perfectly, the design does not wear off like many other cases I have bought in the past. My favorite case by far and would recommend to anyone who likes Fairy Tail."
Have not melted like the other one I had. Have a 150 amp and a 60 amp fuse in it. 0 gauge in and two 4 gauge out.
works.
"Now my mifi works,"
This is a very nice heavy charger that two items can be charged at once. This Iflash ISB charger is very sturdy product.  I have bought my share of flimsy car chargers and this one sure looks and feels expensive. My ISB fit smoothly and easily into the slot.  I was given the chance to test this item for an honest opinion.  This is a very nice charger and I am please with the quality.
I received my order in just a few days. I'm so happy now I don't have to charge my phone everytime I turn around.
so far so good. alot of muscle training to learn! from an ex-iPhoner
I bought tHis for my wife and she loves it.
"I looked at lots of screen protectors before finally deciding to take a chance on this one.  I'm glad I did.  The quality is great, you can't tell that you have anything over the screen as far as clarity goes.  I didn't have any problems installing it either.  I wiped the screen with alcohol, and then used a micro fiber to wipe it again.  The glass went on very easy.  So far I haven't had any problems with the edges lifting and I've had it about 3 weeks."
Great
great little organizer. very solid and attractive
"Awesome, quick charger works just like the one that came with my phone for home charging.  Galaxy S6 Edge.  Super fast free delivery, arrived earlier than estimated time."
Great case! It is sturdy. It has a nice design. I've dropped my phone several times and the case only has a few minor scratches but at least none are on the phone. I will definitely be buying cases from this company from now on.
Really good head unit.  Sounds awesome and gives out plenty of power for my 7 speaker audio system in my car. Only problem I can think of is the option to save names of songs you hear on the radio is only for iPhone users and also I can't get my unit to dis play the name for radio at all via an analog connection.
"Stuck with the a voyager. This one un-paired a lot, not voice command for incoming calls, controls ar not well placed."
"Love the variety in color, I can use a different color for each day of the week!"
Grandson had no problems fixing his phone
A card doesn't fit all the way in but I do keep some cash in it otherwise I like this case I wish it had more colors as I really  don't like the ones offered but that is totally  preference it works great with my edge and isn't to bulky..
Love these speakers
This case fits my phone perfectly and offers great protection from me dropping the phone or getting knocked about while it's in my pocket.
One of my favorite gadgets!!
My order was handled promptly and satisfied with my purchase.
Perfect case
This was an excellent amp and still works now. It provides some really good base and even better we bought this at an excellent price. I wish they were still available I would definitely buy another for my other car.
It's really cute
"A Really good product for the best price, just can't beat Plantronics and Amazon Prime!!!"
Okay
"This watch is a great idea BUT!  It took a full afternoon of repeated attempts to get the watch connected.  It was cool for 2 weeks then for no reason, the watch disconnected.  I repeatedly tried to connect.  Uninstalled and re installed the watch manager many times.  There is no responsive customer service from Meta Watch.  I do not recommend this watch.  It has been a great disappointment."
"Good luck getting this hooked up, they never could in my case.  Let me tell you the whole story:  Currently, it appears that Cricket is foolishly making all their &#34;Bring your own phone&#34; kits with a single nano card and separate adapters.  Well, these adapters may or may not work with your phone, making them worthless.  No place had these cards in the micro, and Cricket was clueless about this.  So I bought this one off here and crossed my fingers.  Long story short it did not work.  It would not connect via the website, so I called Cricket, and they couldn't connect it (error pps099, whatever that is, they either couldn't or wouldn't tell me), so they told me to go to the store, to which I told them the Gamestop people have absolutely no clue about these phones (they don't).  I then talked to them via online chat, and they gave me these same options, only telling me if I could go to a &#34;corporate store&#34; they might be able to get service.  Right, like I'm going to drive 2 hrs to connect up a bloody telephone. UPDATE:  Tried again and called the number 855-619-6021 (this is where you want to call!)  and got an Excellent Cricket representative (give him a raise, cricket) who walked me right through getting this hooked up and also ported over my number from my old carrier.  Up to this point (as noted above) I was ready to tear my hair out over this.  It really comes down to finding the right person who knows what they are doing.  I would give this 5 stars if not for my initial experience, so I removed one. Beware everyone, Cricket seems to have nice customer service, but they are overall the most maddening company I have yet to deal with.  They are all confused and nothing seems to work."
Good price and when I asked if they could try to get it her faster they did and I'm extremely satisfied! Came in a nice package plus idk why people were whining about the head phones they were clear and loud to me! Maybe people need hearing checked and or maybe my ears are just really good or maybe some people rather make there ear drums vibrate like crazy till its hard to hear for an hour or something I'm not sure! The only thing is I'm with straight talk so its not the phones fault my internet is so slow!
Very disappointed with this device. It is flimsy and only maintains a charged for a short period of time.
Very cheap and bad quality. Fell off the first day.
"Advertises that this works with the passport max but it doesn't. Let me rephrase that, it will hold the max, however it doesn't lock in place and slides off easily. Making u turns had thrown my detector all over the car. I'm surprised my detector hasn't been damaged because of this."
The unit worked fine and I got my 40 year old cassettes transferred to flash drive then to the computer.
Worked perfectly!
It's very handy for a person on the go. I like it.
Going from a substantial &#34;defense&#34; case to this ballistic case is welcomed.. My previous case put quite a bit of bulk and as nice as it was it was too much.. This case on the other gives me the same warm feeling that my phone is more than okay yet keeps it on the lighter side. Along with the rubber covers over the aux and power port make it even better..
"This case is sturdy and cute.  It is sometimes difficult to plug in certain audio receivers, but otherwise this case is a great fit!"
I'm returning it for a refund because it wouldn'the fit the tablet. I made sure I put in all the information on the Samsung Galaxy tablet 8&#34; and it didn't come close to fitting it on the width. I was very disappointed because this was for my grandson's birthday present.
"little bit of work to replace, but cheaper than a new phone, especially when the only reason I needed it in the first place was due to a bent pin inside the USB."
The product is excellent for my phone.
The color of the case is as exactly how it appears online. I love it!
"Came sooner than expected, and fit perfectly"
"This seemed to be a good idea, but the adhesive on the glass would not spread out to the full screen size, leaving a corner unstuck with a bubble under the whole corner clear to the edge.  Nothing I tried would fix this, so the screen saver is worthless.  I would not buy this one again."
Works like a charm and is comfortable!
Very nice cover for my cell phone. Was as described and works great.
The colors on the case were smearing into other colors when I got it. Not worth the money.
"I bought this phone in November of 2014, hoping that this would be the answer to my wishes (being able to keep all of my apps as further updates would surely follow the purchase).  Unfortunately, my wishes were smashed to bits. Let me preface by saying that I don't know how to nor do I ROOT phones. I have purchased several so-called 8GB internal memory phones only to find out that there isn't enough room to update the apps.<br /><br />And YES, I did experiment with moving (a percentage of ) apps to my added on mini SD card. Like every other phone, you can't really add the &#34;app&#34; to the SD card, but rather what you use for that app (photos, music, book prefs). I did all I could to avoid updating bloat apps (HTC, GOOGLE, etc.) to no avail. Before the last update that I put off for over a week, I went from 0.63 GB of free space to 0.37 GB of free space. That means that I can't update any blessed apps that I want to, like AMAZON, KINDLE, AVAST, SKYPE without either moving something to the card or removing app(s).<br /><br />It would appear that I'm not shooting high enough. Perhaps I need more memory, like what galaxy phones allegedly have. Problem is, I don't want a contract and can't afford the S6. That leaves older phones with older batteries because they are no longer made. Most of which won't allow you to remove the battery to replace that.<br /><br />I just can't win."
yet too receive but i seen the same one at best buy for an amazingly higher price soo i do know the quality its five stars
Really happy with the phone. Good price and arrived quickly.
"Wait till i get my hands on Nokia, Boost & whoever else has their hands in on this garbage phone. I have service through boost, on my iphone...PERFECT...on this...NEVER...even in the begginings of the month. Boost tells me it all depends what phone you buy. The 30$ ones from walmart work better than this garbage. What a waste."
Great
"Works well, synced fine and I'm not tech savvy. The band is comfortable. It seems to be more secure than my polar F4 that I bought about a year ago. I did use it a lot though so it just kind of wore out a little. Update: 8/30/15 I tried to swim in my endless pool today and it didn't work so well. It didn't keep my heart rate like my polar does. I'm going to try to tighten it next time or see if I can use it with my Polar strap and see how that works. I like to do high-intensity interval training so if this doesn't work with my polar strap and this is getting sent back. I simply have to see my heart rate while I'm swimming. I took away a star for this."
These are perfect for my 6 port charger to make a ready to go charging station and for my portable pocket charger. Sometimes a regular 3 foot cord is overkill. These are just the right size. The plugs have a solid connection on both ends.
It really allows the edge to be seen and looks really slick on this new phone. It's not very heavy either.
Ok I pad
Great phone case. Provided excellent protection.
worked for less than 5 minutes. JUNK** do not waste your money on this.
It works great. It's light and it allows for extra 2 charges of my iPhone.
"Protective and slim case, easy to grip and buttons are accessible."
It was very handy the mother in law is happy. The shipping was fast and on time
No good
"It worked great for my class's embedded programming display cabinet. I soldered on a power jack for a DC power adapter. The only reason it didn't get a five star rating, is because it doesn't explain how to connect audio."
"I was beguiled by the many positive reviews to believe that this was possible. I consider myself fairly handy with most things and have played around with electronics before. Having now destroyed one phone, I may be able to fix one in the future but I doubt I'd try again.  With great patience and care, I think that the LCD/Digitizer had cracked before I'd even begun to get the screen separated.  I'm sure this is a fantastic kit, but unless you have absolute confidence in your abilities and some experience, I'd recommend against this unless you are fully willing to trash the phone.  At the very least - back up anything you may want to say. Lulled into a false sense of security, I neglected to do so.  As of 9/8: Upon reflection, while my experience was far from successful, the kit itself was great. There were a multitude of tools for use and all of great quality. Further, the immediate response from the seller after I posted my review was amazing. While they aren't able to miraculously restore my phone, they have gone above and beyond all my expectations to make it as right as they can.  I would strongly recommend them as a seller.  And if you know what you are doing, then I can recommend this kit."
"I was looking for a duel charger and came across this item. Works great in the car, just as advertised. Would especially recommend for the price point."
Excellent case for my ipad mini. Awesome design and protection.
"Great strong case , and glass works great . I have chipped the glass protector on my phone from dropping it on rocks"
"functional, they did the job"
It oes just what I wanted it for!
The touch/feel of this protector is better than Apple's own glass coating.
Love this phone case its very good leather the stlus has lasted a very long time i highly recommended this phone case!😃
"It didn't work and I had to send it back. I was going to have to take my case off every night in order for the phone to charge because it wouldn't work through the case I had on my phone. It shouldn't matter what case I have, it should be strong enough to charge."
It was a gift.  They were happy with it
"I loved it, it arrived on time and fit my phone perfectly, the colors are right and it's exactly like the picture. 10/10 would recommend"
"Fantastic case. Looks slick as can be. The hard buttons remain fully functional. Only reason it doesn't get a 5 is that the case is very difficult to remove, and also, the input for the charger will not fit all chargers. Otherwise, it's a beautiful case."
Product as described.
Its a cord. Works or doesn't. This one did.
"Cool cover. I really like how it fits the phone. You take the original back case off of the phone and then this one snaps on.  Only problem is that I am worrked it may break along the seam. Other than that, it is good."
Was really excited when i first ordered them. I tried them out yesterday for literally 3 minutes they worked fine and sounded great.. Tried to use them today and nothing worked. I charged them for an hr and a half and still wouldnt turn on and no lights or anything come on. Now they are so hot it literally burns my fingers to even pick them up. What is going on!?
Goof for what I need
Was told to upload a picture to process replacement. Very nice looking but was cracked.
I ordered two of these about 1.5 months ago. The first one did not work correctly right out of the box. Would not even charge my smart phone one time before running out of juice.<br />On the second unit the power button fell off after only a few weeks. I am very disappointed in these.<br /><br />Update:  After writing the previous review the manufacturer reached out to me and offered to send me replacements.  This was outstanding customer service and in every way makes up for the previous shortcomings.<br /><br />The new chargers both are functioning flawlessly and have neither issue the previous chargers had.  I am not very happy with my purchase.
"Good value - and I like that they have the nerve to mark the Lightning end with their own emblem.  That way I know when/if a cable fails, if it's one of Csync's.  We have 4 iPhone 5 phones of various versions in the family, so we have many, many of these cables.  They fail often and I've never known from whence they came.  Now I'll know if it's one of these.  So far so very good: no &#34;this is a non-genuine part you are using&#34; message on the phones when these are plugged in.  They work very well."
Good product
It's great
This amp right here is a good amp i love this one it play real good on some 12s and on some 15s if you are look for a good amp this here will be the best one..
Love it so far.
Awesome case
cord to charge is really picky. only charges my iPhone 6 to 100% two times.
"Samsung Galaxy S4 Active Screen protector fits perfectly, was easy to put on, works great."
"I like the case, it looks & feels nice. It wasn't what I pictured it look like especially in comparison to the pictures, but overall it's nice."
good
good cover
"I should have gotten one of these a year earlier than I did, so I could stop carrying my laptop around whenever I had to give a presentation. Now I can do it all from my tablet, which is so much easier for travel, even to and from work."
"Wish the entire case had the design, not just the back."
This is a great product.  I have used it for both my Note and my iPhone 6+.  It charges fast.  This is holding up better than the one I bought from Brookstone.  I've only used the wall unit.  I haven't used the car charger.  We've had this for about 8 months.
Cute but a pain to put on take off if you are heavy battery user.
Good
Works as listed....even fits my Mini Cooper S round vents...magnet strong enough to hold iPhone 6 Plus with Otter Box Defender case!
Works perfect.
Love this screen protector.
Broke within a couple weeks
Great built plug
"This mini-sized car charger can go along way! Being so accustomed to see chargers that are quite large - when I opened the package I was quite surprised by its size. And quickly asked myself how can a charger so small in size have all the functions that a normal larger charger has?<br /><br /> The ALBK Car Charger is quite sleek and professional in its design and is extremely light in weight - enough to fit in your pocket without even noticing. At the same time, having two ports with this mini gadget is extremely helpful as often times my family and I would struggle with the charge on our phones whilst travelling long distances - due to the shortage of chargers. I occasionally tend to use my phone quite often so this charger comes extremely handy especially due to having the fastest charging speed of 2.4A. This charger can also charge quite a variety of products including (iPhone, iPad, iPod, Samsung, HTC,Nokia Smartphone,Sony,BlackBerry). Another added bonus is that this charger is extremely safe as it turns off automatically when the charge is complete.<br /><br />The question then arises? Why bother investing much into those huge chunky charges which take much of the room - when you get this charger which has speed, durability, compactness in size, safety, and convenience for a very affordable price! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"Yes, this IS a two piece unit (although at first blush it appears to be one piece).  There is one problem, though, and that one of the pieces of plastic partially covers the sound level button and causes the telephone to act erratically.  So, take some wire snips and cut it off and you're good to go."
Great!
I don't think this case would ever hold up to even a day of my life!
Good
"Not completely anti bubble but I would say mostly. Easy to install, and it fits great."
It's long last charge. Also charges quick.
"i cant understand why it is best seller on Amazon in its category. I have tried few others as well and it is just average. In fact I am using Anker which is bit costlier but totally worth it, and looks much more crisp display and screen looks solid.<br />probably most of the reviews are because of this company's &#34;review us and get a free battery case&#34;. not sure.<br />again, my screen protector was average. not saying its bad but for people who have not tried other glass screens, you wont know the difference."
"Nice product.  Does, as advertised.  Getting used to not carrying a wallet and only carrying necessary with me."
"After a month, heats up very hot and stops working."
Did not look like the photo. I sent it back
&#34; Installed easily. Prompt delivery and the instructions were clear and concise. &#34;
I love my new phone case! I have had lots of compliments on it as well! I have had only had it for a month or so....how long it holds up is yet to be determined!
IPhone 6 fits good  everything is working good so far but only have had it a week  armbands a little small could be a little bit bigger but it's working for me  and I'm not a very big guy
"Fits perfectly, looks great."
"The camera needs work; the zoom doesn't go that far. Other than that, I think it's a pretty good phone compared to my last one."
Love it!
Product fits phone. Want to try for other colours. Coloured cases are popular now.
Very basic phone that helped us stay connected on a trip to Europe.
I bought it for my teen daughter. It fit great and has survived many drops on many different surfaces!
Mounted this to a Victory Jackpot.  Gives great versatility for listening to music or using it as navigation. Holds Iphone 6 (with Case) really well.
Received as pictured. Works good.  I would buy again.
Leaves a residue/glue from the sticker tabs after you apply the protector in the corner of my screen. Trying to remove it is nearly impossible.  :(...
"These headphones can be fine as an entry into the foray of wireless headphones, though if you are looking for a value purchase that will last for a while this may not be the option you should choose, especially because this is purchased via an independent seller in Japan who will make it difficult for you to replace your likely broken headphones, as they have made it difficult for me.<br /><br />It's very easy to enjoy these headphones when you first receive them, as the packaging looks great and they work decently enough when you first begin to use them, after figuring them out depending on if you have past experience with bluetooth headphones or not. If you do have past experience, you probably won't like these as much.<br /><br />The sound quality is ok, though it leaves much to be desire compared to other competing headphones. I immediately noticed that the sound was inferior to previous headphones that I had purchased, though it's not as if these headphoens have terrible quality. The price is good as well, but once again compared to other competing brands you would be able to find a superior product in the same price window. The earbuds don't fit too great depending on ear sizes and I have noticeably small ears, especially for the size of my head, so these can seem a bit taxing to wear after and extended usage.<br /><br />The overall look is nice, but at the cost of having uncomfortable plastic material that always feels like it is going to snap. As a matter of fact, my headphones did snap on one side, and it's not as if I employed heavy usage to these things to try and test their limits anyways. On top of the snapping, all of a sudden my headphone stopped functioning via the included wire, which is a crucial feature to have, as naturally the sound quality is better with a wire and I don't always have battery because of the somewhat poor battery life for these headphones. Because of the product trying to look &#34;cool&#34; like other popular competitors like Beats Headphones (which are an even more horrible investment) they sacrifice more sturdy and logical alternatives to make these headphones long lasting and high quality headphones.<br /><br />Even after all these problems, I hoped maybe a warranty would be able to fix something or try to at least get some help. Until I purchased these, I wasn't aware that I got them through Japan, though that is obviously my fault. Even after realizing that information, I wasn't aware how difficult it would be to try and set up any type of help with repair or warranty. I would contact audio-technica trying to get information, and they would tell me to contact the individual seller I (and you would/will have) purchased them from, and that they couldn't help me in this situation. Then I would contact the individual seller and after responding way later to my questions about warranty, they would try to tell me to contact audio-technica, ultimately proving to not be of any help. The confusing back and forth really rubs me a wrong way as a consumer and leads me to believe that I have been set-up a little bit in terms of warranty, but that is what it is, just wanted to warn anyone who was planning on purchasing these and thought they would be secure if problems occurred.<br /><br />All in all these wouldn't be the worst purchase to make, there are just better alternatives currently available on the market that will be less of a headache to deal with on the customer support side of things so I'd say stay away."
Good
I'm am absolutely not happy! This is not a straight talk phone and I bought two. Now I will have to pay an extra $60 per phone to get it activated.
Works better than the other 2 I've previously purchased. Holds the phone securely and is to adjust.
The bass is almost non-existent but I bought it mainly for listening to audiobooks while mowing the lawn and it sounds okay for that.  Occasionally it will disconnect and then immediately reconnect which is incredibly annoying since this causes my audiobook to pause.  Hard to complain though at this price.<br /><br />Update: 09/06/2015<br />After posting the original review the customer service department contacted me and asked that I ship this unit back to them for a replacement.  They feel that this behavior indicates a defect and they want to make it right.  Score one for great customer service!
Case was too thick and made phone difficult to operate.
Just perfect
awesome product. fits my phone perfectly. thank you for a speedy delivery
Got for my kid to use so I didn't have to listen to their you tube videos and games and horrible music and all other noises emanating from their ipads 24x7.  Manufacturer is awesome - and very responsive following a query on when the product would be available again.  The charges last a long time.  The extra cables and storage bag and everything else are a plus.  My kids love to dance around without wires and never adopted other wired headphones previously.  I totally recommend this product.
Just fits my phone great and cheaper than the Verizon store wants you to pay for the same thing.
Does what it's suppose to. Nice quality & fair price.
"the rubber case it too big, so the outer shell &#34;hard case&#34; cannot be used with it.  It is a so-so design, truly not perfect."
"This product is really quite amazing. The case comes in two pieces -- one inner protective case that is made of a sturdy material, the second is the holder which I can loop the armband through. LOVE that I can slide my phone downward to remove it easily from the second casing mid-workout then slide it upward when I'm ready to go again.<br /><br />I use it mainly for yoga and dance; my phone stays in place and I don't feel restricted."
Authentic nice awesome
Very nice bulletproof case. Very sturdy like it a lot.
Comfortable and holds phone securely.  Got this one because of the handy pocket inside for keys/cards works great.
Very nice
Perfect combo wallet and phone case!
"Amazing! Charges insanely fast.  So convenient to not have to carry around any other cords. Literally plug this into a wall when your using your phone then pull it out and plug it to your phone when you need to.  So simple.  Not bulky by any means.  The pouch is great and the adapters are helpful too for your non-iphone devices (though the lightning-to-30pin adapter was made incorrectly and is utterly useless for older iphones because it doesn't fit in an apple 30 pin slot).  The battery indicator light is gives you an idea about how many times you can juice up before having to recharge the pack (I've gotten 4 full charges on my iphone 6 from one full pack).<br /><br />the only concerning thing would be the location of the outlet connector.  Because it's all the way at the top end, if you plug the pack into a horizontal wall outlet it will feel like its putting undue stress on its connectors (almost as if it might bend over time if used this way repeatedly).  this is not to say it's flimsy or anything because this hasn't happened when I've done it.  I've charged it this way a couple of times out of necessity without any issues, but I usually try to find outlets with the slots aligned vertically to be extra nice to my pack and just be safe."
"Works just as advertised. The operation takes some getting used to but it is a great unit for the price. The play button can be a little unresponsive given that three buttons are in pretty close proximity, so it will take some practice to be able to nail it on the first try."
Pretty easy to use. Self explanatory. Broke the USB cord but luckily takes an easy to find generic cord. Good for the price.
"I like the case. It is not as big as the otter box, which has some disadvantages, but it also has advantages. The biggest problem I hav is probably not the case manufacturers problem. The iPhone chargers fit perfect, but other chargers may not fit through the charger hole in the case."
By far the sturdiest selfie stick I've encountered so far. I'm very pleased with it. It holds the phone (iPhone 6 Plus) VERY tightly!....but it takes the spring loaded holder to its maximum extension in order to hold it so I'll be paying close attention to its durability and wear over time. That is the only concern I have about it at this point and it might not even be an issue at all.
low quality earbuds! They do not stay in the ear! cheaply made!
Perfect for 500 watt amp. No more over heating wire
Pleased with this case
I love these blue cables...Long and they are a very good quality.  Now when I'm looking for a cord to use to recharge my phone I just reach for the blue cable.
"Looks really nice.  Matches an aluminum Apple watch sport 42mm pretty well.  Comfortable to wear all day long, and seems pretty secure.  Very impressed."
"I bought this because 2 other reviewers said it worked with their SEEK, doesn't work with mine...."
Not a great product !!!!! it broke a few days after ! And it's the Second case I bought
Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
Quality material! Excellent fit on the phone.  Exactly how it was decribed.
very pleased with phone
Good quality
"This works very well.  I installed it following the directions put the case back on, and I have had a clear screen ever since.  The screen protector is invisible and not discernible to the eye.  The only difference that I have detected is that my fingerprint substitute for the passcode to activate my phone now is much more consistent in its effectiveness since I installed the screen protector; but I can see no understandable reason why this should be a cause and effect relationship."
This is a pretty good portable backup battery pack for the money. It charges relatively fast and it charges my phone well. I can get one complete charge for my phone out of it.
A must if you are working.  I have a lot of moving things around the yard. And kept losing my phone.  This keeps the phone clipped on to be in tact. Great buy
"Very practical! Holds well my Galaxy S6, I take it with me mostly when I am traveling!"
It looks really nice
"Fun, updated, glittery, fun cover."
"Very thin case. It can fit in my armband case with this case on. Gold color matches the phone color almost exactly. Most people think I don't have a case on. Thankfully haven't dropped my phone yet to see how the case would help. A very small corner piece on the bottom left did chip off somehow, but no biggie. Purchased the end of May 2015."
Very Exellent
Love my selfie stick!  It got here amazingly fast and it is great value.  Major extension and simple to use... no app necessary.
"Totally worth it!! Exactly like the description has lasted me a really long time even went to the beach and sand scratched it but I can still see crystal clear. Makes screen Very sensitive accidentally deleted apps on my main screen while in pocket. Also includes screen cleaner and stickers to help you place it on your phone, recently dropped it hard and screen protector cracked but only about an 1in in length in center and did not break actual screen, can still use my phone perfectly! Will buy again and again!"
"Wayyyyyy to expensive for a piece of plastic, rip off, found one for $1.50 at rc711. com."
They are junk!
"I really like these. They fit flush into the lighter plug and allow me to keep the compartment/ashtray door closed all the time. When I want to use it, I pull the cable out of the glove box and plug it in. For me it easily charges two iPhones at the same time while driving on a trip. No more fighting over the plug and it disappears when not in use - win/win!"
Can't but much in it:(
Good
Are u guys serious about this ?<br />I just got it today and as soon as I opened it i got so mad
"I would give them 5 *, but one of the new batteries doesn't hold a charge like the other. I really think my problem is with my phone. I will find out  tomorrow after I get it back to factory reset, to make sure it's the phone not the battery. The wall charger is the best idea, so you don't have to wear out the mini micro USB charging plug. A1 + in my book no wear and tear on the phone for you to worry about if you ask a little one to plug it in or unplug it "
Its good
exactly what I wanted
"Great case, great price!"
"Had it for a week before it broke. There is a screw that holds the ball hinge to the strap.The ball hinge then is connected to the main part of the mount that holds the ipad. I had it mounted on the handlebars of my spin bike. When I moved my spin bike, I bumped the mount just slightly and that plastic surrounding the screw snapped.<br /><br />Returning the product and will look for other options."
received as pictured
Great little radio.
Got it for my husband he loves it!
"Great sound, and easy to install.  The quality was top notch for the price.  I wish I would have stuck to my JL's sooner..."
"I lost my Jawbone after only two wearings. I was so upset that I came home and wrote to the company.<br />I was amazed how quickly they responded  to my email.<br />Jawbone then followed up with numerous emails in order to send me a replacement Jawbone!!<br />I received my new Jawbone within 10 days of losing the first one due to the band clasp coming apart.<br />I have been using the clip on Jawbone daily.<br />I am an ice skater, primarily an ice dancer with a lot of footwork involved.<br />Im not sure how accurate the Jawbone is, but I will continue to use this to monitor my exercise.<br />Have you had other inquire about the accuracy of its use with ice skating?"
excellent
Broke too easy.
"Still adjusting to fitting of ear buds, much better results with changing out to a smaller set of ear buds that were included. Clarity of music is much better than with my previous ear phones"
The USB cord is cheap as hell.
"Having tested one of BLU's earlier (Studio) cellphone models, I was curious to see how this new model fared. I can honestly say that this phone does not disappoint.<br /><br />Unlike the previous BLU model I tested, the Energy X model has a very solid feel to it. Part of that seems to be due to an improved case that uses a higher grade of plastic. Part is due to a heavier, longer-lasting 4,000 mAh internal battery. Combine that with an even larger 5.5&#34; screen and you have all the ingredients for a phone that looks, feels and operates far beyond any expectations one should have for a cellphone that sells for well under $200.<br /><br />On the plus side, this model's expansive 5.5&#34; display is bright, crisp and very highly responsive. It's quad core processor gives it more than enough juice to stream both audio and video. Resolution-wise, you will not get the same quality picture as an iPhone or a Samsung Galaxy, but it is quite adequate for viewing the usual content you would normally be watching on a 5.5&#34; screen.<br /><br />The phone's battery performance is great on standby, but drains a bit faster than other phones I have used when running applications. I suspect that the phone's ultra-bright, oversized screen is the main culprit when it comes to battery drain. Fortunately, the phone's internal battery charges up to 4,000 mAh, so you can go longer without recharging than with most phones. The phone's plain-vanilla Android OS is a joy to set up as compared to most phones. You will not find any of the bloatware common to phones you will get directly from your carrier, or even direct from most manufacturers like Samsung. No features are blocked or locked, that includes the ability to tether or operate your phone as a  portable wi-fi hotspot.<br /><br />With all that said, there are obviously some shortcomings with a phone this inexpensive. These mostly fall under the category of &#34;frills&#34; as far as I am concerned, but they may be more important to you. The most obvious shortcoming of this phone is its camera. If you want to record HD video or take high-resolution pictures, this is definitely not the phone for you. It's 8 MP front-facing camera operates slowly and produces sub-par pictures as compared to most modern smartphones. So, don't get your hopes up when it comes to taking pictures.<br /><br />The second most obvious shortcoming is the phone's memory, or lack thereof. 8GB of internal memory and 1GB of RAM don't go a long way if you run a lot of memory intensive apps on your phone. You can add up to 64GB of memory using a micro SD card, but SD cards operate at slower speeds than RAM, so choose your apps (and where you store them) carefully. If you do add a micro SD card for extra memory, be sure to buy a Class 10 card. They may run you a few dollars more, but they seem to run much faster and more reliable than the cheaper Class 4 cards.<br /><br />Another oddball &#34;feature&#34; is the phone's use of removable &#34;cartridges&#34; to store both the micro SD card and the SIM (actually, SIMS, since it holds up to two SIM cards). The phone comes with a tiny &#34;key&#34; you need to use to insert or remove the memory or SIM. You could just as easily use a paperclip, but the fact that these tiny cartridges could become so easily lost or broken while swapping memory or SIM cards is a bit worrisome. If you are the type of person who almost never accesses the SIM or SD card, this should not be an issue. If you swap these frequently, I would stay away from this model though.<br /><br />The last downside I will mention is the phone's battery. While it has great battery life, the inability to swap batteries or quick-charge is a bit of a disappointment. I think that BLU went the wrong direction in making the battery non-swappable, but I'm guessing that accounts for how they kept the price of the phone so low.<br /><br />Altogether, this is an impressive looking phone with an easy to read screen, tons of features and plenty of battery life. While it does not measure up to an iPhone or Samsung Galaxy when it comes to specs, what you do get for the price is pretty awesome. With an unlocked GSM smartphone with dual SIMS, quad core processor and 5.5&#34; display for under $200 you can hardly go wrong.nd plenty of battery life.

good
"Great phone, has the old key board that I just love and larger screen.  Still need to get a little bit used to the new features, but this is almost necessary upgrade for bb users!"
Good adapter
This is what I wanted and it worked perfectly and continues to work perfectly.
"Highly Recommended. Easy to Install, Protects my Apple Watch Edge to Edge I have bought a couple other protectors from shops. I could not install the first product and ended up damaging it. Second time, I got the shopkeeper to install it for me. It gave up on the edges after a week. I finally decided to jump on Amazon and ended up buying this brand. I am writing this review after trying this product for 4 weeks. Heres why I like it.<br />1. Unlike other protectors, the Ruby Shield protects my 38mm Watch edge to edge.<br />2. Installation is straight forward. No liquid spray and no curing time. Its a dry and easy installation. I was done in 5 minutes.<br />3. No bubbles during installation. Crystal clear view.<br />4. It hasnt failed on the edges after 4 weeks. And doesnt look like it will fail anytime soon."
Overall I like the  cover.  The only problem with this product is the stick on clear screen.  It is almost impossible to put it on straight and get all the bubbles out from under it.  A tempered glass screen would work much better and wouldn't be near as frustrating as trying to put that darn thing on.
It's perfect
"Awesome case! I have a friend who works at a cell phone store, he asked where i got it from, when i told him how much, he was super suprised and said it was actually really nice case!"
"It worked for about an hour with my galaxy s5 and then it just stopped working, and has not worked since."
"exchange for a review, and my nephew has wanted one. We tried another type previously and weren't happy. This one feels really high quality and has worked without flaws. It's not flimsy. The telescoping extension works great. I'm super pleased with the plug and play feature. I do recommend this purchase."
works well
"Good charger for my iPhone!  It hasn't had any problems yet, and I have used it for about a week."
Great price<br />Great Quality
This is a nice holder.  I use it for my cell phone and GPS.  The only downside is that sometimes it swivels while I'm driving.
The part that protects the screen pushes the button in on the phone turning it off and on which kills the battery. I would not recommend this product.
"Works well, great price. Delivered quick"
Great product as always i have bought these for all my phones super fast shipping and they work as they should just make sure when you install it clean area and surface and you will be fine and they fit perfect thank you
Broke after only about 5 uses.
Grandson loves it!
Was not cut right and was not happy at all. I threw them away because there was no need for them.
Good price. Didn't ask for 3.  Came a day later than promised.  Overall I am satisfied.
"Already my favorite speaker. It's easy to use, can be taken practically anywhere, and has awesome sound quality for its size. It beats out any other device in my home for streaming music. The rubber band on the sides can be annoying since it pulls away from the speaker at the edges and NudeAudio's customer support leaves a lot to be desired when communicating with them, but overall the speaker itself is pretty awesome."
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
Arrived fast and is very nice!
Excellent but the upper part after some time will not close properly so I had to remove it<br />Charging is excellent
"Outstanding quality. The case feels amazing like a high end 70 dollar case. Highly recommended. I wish I would've got this first, instead of that expensive otterbox commuter case"
Cables suck. Doesn't charge iPad  air or iPhone 6plus.
The edges don't stick very well. All three of mine eventually peeled off no matter how clean your phone was.
Only held battery charge for 40 minutes
I have had this case for less than a month and I dropped it and the case cracked and chipped! I am going to try to return it. But I don't know if I can
This case is AWESOME!!! Still in perfect shape months later. Easy to clean.
"One word GARBAGE!  Not for Samsung galaxy Note4.  I come to realize if these did work they woudnt be the price that they are.  Scratched my phone case cover and I think possibly the lens, bringing to my wireless provider to check if indeed it has a scratch. Dont be stupid all these reviews are BS! Probably paid to give good reviews!"
"RECIEVED THE COVER TODAY,I LIKE IT VERY MUCH"
This is a great product.  Easy to install and no bubbles.  Crystal clear.
ordered a new battery for my samsung galaxy III phone and it came on time and works great.
Water damaged phone wouldn't charge.  Fast swap and great price. The phone now works.
"Had a problem, it was resolved quickly and professionally.  Great device.  Mounted the 520 on my Trike (sky-cycle).  Purchased the 5&#34; because of the smaller size.  Now, I'm thinking there may be enough room for the 7&#34;.  Thank you Sarasota and IFly !!  :)"
"Pretty much as advertised.  Nice cover, but would really rather have one that is less bulky.  Doesn't need place for cards, just protect the phone from pocket dials, etc."
I love these chargers.  I have ordered more than one in the past.  I got them on a lightning deal.  The price is right and I don't get that annoying message on my phone saying that it doesn't support this cable/accessory.  My phone charges fast.  I have a cable at work and one at home.  I highly recommend these chargers. You
"Very easy to install and clearly wont peel or bubble any time soon! Highly recommended, and fits inside Zagg Arsenal case."
It works better than my other 10 feet cord!!! Hope I can take care of it instead of buying it all over again!!! 😁😆
Good price for item.
like having a new phone
Have had it for months and no issues like the many others I have bought.
was not for my phone
Item was as expected and fast shipping
Item as described.
Tried to disinfect my phone once with a rubbing alcohol wipe. Basic Isopropyl alcohol. It DESTROYED the protector with scratches and swirl marks. How am I supposed to clean my phone after lab??
"Exactly what I was looking for a full featured standard size smartphone at considerably less price.  The phone is in perfect condition looks just like new.  For phone service I use Tracfone &#34;Bring Your Own Phone&#34;.  Since it's a second phone I just do 90 days at $20, roughly $6.66 a month.  I had a SIM chip from Tracfone already for Verizon type phones.  We have WiFi here which covers a lot of my use."
Fits as promised.... Does make difficulty when pressing buttons along or near the edge. But it is still a good screen protector.
"Perfect for cutting through the clutter, finding your stuff and getting out the door fast. I found Tile through their crowd fund campaign and bought four in November 2014. I liked my first set of Tiles, and probably used them once a week (mostly to find my keys to get out of the house faster).<br /><br />When I saw that Tile was coming out with a new version that could ring my phone, I jumped fast. Since I've upgraded to the new Gen 2 Tiles, I literally use them everyday. Seriously, a huge game changer, couldn't be more stoked."
I love it
"this was a gift for a friend of mine, she says she likes it, the delivery came in a day and a half."
"Does exactly what it's suppose to, protect my screen"
"Are you kidding...why did someone recommend this...used Waze on the 600 mile trip home to DC from Maine.  Kept accurate reading of traffic conditions all the way..  Not once did this cord combined with the Garmin give accurate or any information on traffic jams or conditions.  On the way up to Maine I used a Garmin and cord, &#34;suggested alternate route&#34; and when I started to use it, it took me back to the original route.  What was that about?  In my estimation both products leave a tremendous amount to be desired.  Extremely disappointed...The cost is ab surd for something that seems only to give some semblance of a map route..period...a total waste of money."
Very pleased with the product.
"I purchased this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion. There are a few things I like about this product one is the digital screen that lets you know the state of your cars battery voltage and how much power is being supplied to your device while it's charging. The other thing that is cool is the head of the device can be maneuvered a little once it is completely plugged in.<br />I have a Samsung Galaxy S5, the speed is not super fast but from 0% battery it can get a full charge  within 1hr30mins - to - 2hrs. It has dual usb ports so you can charge 2 devices at the same time but I only used it for my phone but it is handy to have. When the car is off there is less voltage, so while the car is running it may increase the speed of the charge a little. I would recommend this product if you are concerned about the state of your cars battery."
I wish u sold these bulk.
Love the Pebble Steel and can't beat the price.
Love this cute case. Nice and thin yet protective.
"I had recently upgraded my phone from the S3 to the S6. Most of the time when holding my S6 with one hand and at an angle to get a better view at what I am reading or viewing, the phone slips off my hand and falls down to the floor. Not good at all. Since my phone is new, I was afraid for it to get damage from constant dropping on the floor. I bought this Samsung Galaxy S6 phone case by Collen in gold color. The color gold is transparent but the color is still visible. The material made out of it is really nice, pliable, and seems durable. The material is not too thick which I really like. It does fit like a glove on my S6 and my phone in this protective case does not slip off of my hand! I do recommend this product, it comes in different colors. I chose the gold and it gives my phone a more classy look to it. My husband  even commented on how nice the case is and wants one for his Note 4. I am glad to have purchase this product and have waited for the perfect opportunity. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my own honest opinion."
I bought this for my son and he says it works great. I also bought one for my granddaughter and she loves hers too. She made a point to tell me about taking it on a trip with her where she knew she wouldn't be able to charge her phone.
"Great product, does what needs to be done"
Did not work right out of the package. Had some dirt stuck to the micro usb port. Had to return......Very disappointing!
Suction cup fell off the first day
These headphones lasted about a week before shorting out. If I could give them a zero that would be my honest rating.
Need instructions to return
Works well<br />Would be fantastic if it held more than four cards
Works perfect on my phone and is a great alternative to an Otterbox.
It's not as pinky as you see online. It's more close to cream-color? But i like it.
"USB cables vary in quality in a few important ways, with the most important being the quality of the connectors and the stiffness of the cable.  Stiff cables tend to break more easily than flexible ones, and poorly constructed connectors can make a cable stop working within a few uses.  The cable on this MYOHO version is flexible, if a bit thin, and the connectors are well constructed.  I would expect more from an expensive cable, but it is a good value at this price.  I will update my review if the cable breaks prematurely.<br /><br />Thank you to the company for a review unit."
It broke the 2nd time I used it. :(
Awesome
"Small, handy, and functional. Holds phone well in either orientation. I don't recommend for anything larger than an iPhone 6. Definitely too small for a Note or 6-Plus. I have no trouble with skin-type phone covers."
works fine
"If u talk a lot on the phone wile driving this is excellent. Great batt. Life, comfortable, and plaenty loud to hear wile driving in ur semi truck. I only have to charge this head set once a week and I talk on it for hours every day."
It' was like brand new
Funky and good protection for the phone.
works great
"The Defender Case is a typical OtterBox case that is heavy-duty and durable.  This product is thick and clunky.  I think of it more for a construction worker or similar field.  I like that it has a built in screen protector that does not have to be purchased separately.  The name fits the case.  This case also comes with a durable clip to use on the outside of your clothing or clipped into a bag.  The only real “negative” is the price. . . when it’s Made in China for a few bucks. . . it’s hard to justify the current price.  On the other hand, if you want a case with this kind of protection, it’s a great case."
Love it.
"It works great.  I shake it to check how much charge is left.  It is able to fast charge my phone when I use a quality cable. The cable that came with this battery is not good and won't fast charge the phone. You probably already have a cable that will work with this battery. Also, it looks really good."
"Audio Quality is very bad, loud speakers not loud enough, low network issues"
Nt i expected hate it
"It took me couple weeks to shop around for a decent portable wifi companion that will set up a closed hotspot to share files with limited device.<br /><br />The set up is very easy. Download the app and within 5 minutes, everything is set. (I doubt if you even need to app at all).<br /><br />Now I have a wifi for my device and co-workers to share file and print on the go.<br /><br />One note - I do not need www access, just sharing between devices. This HD companion do have the capability to connect to www but will let it for other reviews to tell you the experience as my main use is a close wifi hub to share files and print on the go."
Good
Charges a mini iPad well.
"Surprising great case, I've been using this for 6 months already and have dropped my phone few times, great protection and fits nice too. I just bought another one for my sister's phone!"
Worked much better than expected at this price. Especially the clear pictures with the macro lens are a delight!
low quality cover
"Is a very nice item, is practice, save the phone any time. The price is normal for it. I like so much. Thank you amazon for delivery faster in my address."
It looked better on the site than in person
Durable and sharp looking!
My wife loves the case!
Nice Case recomended
Met my expectations.
"Saved my phone, cracked the screen protector but glass was fine."
This item more than met my expectations.  GREAT VALUE for the price.
Its great...
I get s lot of compliments for my case.
Better than OEM.
It works only a little better than the original battery which barley lasts the day without even regular use once it has been charged..no problems with on time delivery
The screen protectors fit perfectly and they are great.
"Ok first off I'm a long distance hiker and train during off trips up to 10+ miles a day after work. Now that being said I wanted a device that was accurate (this one isn't) and reliable with SUPPORT! Every time I plugged this unit in the software wanted to update the firmware. GREAT! Of course that's a good thing but after 3 disappointing chats no one could figure out how to get it to actually work. I used the forums tried everything could not get it done it kept giving me the same error. I then would connect to chat and no one would answer even 10 minutes after saying hello and reviewing my questions which were simple. (How do I update firmware, How do I reset Odometer) I had a few other questions but their manual is lacking SUBSTANCE and makes you fumble around. I needed something I could open the box and start using. I don't geocache so that feature is useless the camera is a joke Hello 2003 called they want their camera back (why is this even on a gps?). My biggest grip is with Magellan their support was RUDE and constantly cut the chats off even if the problem wasn't solved! Their phone support was just as bad again RUDE and inconsiderate. For $300 I expect top notch support this wasn't a whim purchase. But I guess I should thank them since I went to a similar Garmin Unit i'm quite happy with support and more features. STAY AWAY from this device."
This case has no support for the phone itself. It comes with a cheap plastic holder that is glued in place. The side broke off about 3days after using it and would no longer hold my phone. Good concept but wish it was made better.
WORKS JUST PERFECT FOR MY LG 4G STYLO PHONE
"I bought this case as a gift for my mom's new iPhone. She loved the color and the matte feel of the case. It seems to protect her phone very well and has a nice lip around the edge that protects it in a fall. I liked it so much, I purchased myself one in white."
Great case
Great product!  I'm using it now to write this review!
Stuck the grip to my dash and now my radar detector is stuck to it!  Perfect for what I needed and works as intended.
"This was the perfect upgrade to my Aux cord mess.  This device paired easily with my iPhone and the sound quality is a notch better than I expected.  The controls have a nice form factor.  The buttons can be identified by feel, which is important while driving.  I was so impressed that I bought a second one for my other car.  Great value."
This case is incredible!  I've dropped my phone many times and the screen is perfect!  It is lightweight and not as bulky as other cases.  Easy to put on.  Just snap it on!
Great product at a great price.
"Easiest and best installation ever.  Looks fantastic.  Beware, it can crack but worth it if you don't expect these to last more than a few months."
"These screen protectors go on easy with no bubbles and are clear.  Some smudges but what do you expect, it's glass!!!"
Cheap but ok
The clip that holds the phone is much more solid than the one I had for about a year. It's a solid cell phone holder and the two usb outlets are very convenient.
"Being that I'm a cellular tech, I have chargers and cables everywhere.  These are actually my favorite ones, mostly because of the connectors and the quality of the cable itself.  The connectors are smaller so they fit inside tighter phone cases, and the cables are well made and haven't been breaking at bending points like many other cables.  I will be purchasing more of these! I am using them with a quickcharge 2.0 charging station and they work amazingly! i also like that they came with two different length cables, that comes in handy!<br /><br />Would purchase again!<br /><br />Note: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review"
These are amazing. I love everything about them.
Saves the grandkids phones
"I love the products, i actually get exactly want i wanted"
This totally protects the screen on my Samsung Galaxy Note 4.
It doesn't work on my computer.  Very disappointed.
The color changed to yellowish
"Was kind of difficulty to put on, but once on its great. ..no scratches!!"
Very cheap case. This not protect anything. Very fragil.!! After i got it I went to buy a otter case expensive but worth it.
"Shipment received faster then I had anticipated ! Great product just as described, couldn't have asked for anything more."
I really liked the case. Before ordering I was thinking the quality would not be good but when I received I felt really good that I ordered as it is good quality wise as well. Now I'm thinking to order headphones but again lil doubtful lets see
"Great sturdy case, holster holds live securely ave the holster clips onto belt smoothly avid secure. Very firm nicely engineered case.  Can't beat the price for such a good case."
Good
Just as good as Zagg for a fraction of the price
Would be a 5 star if it covered the hold phone & not leave a little part uncovered
It did not work !!!
"Working well for my Droid 4. Though the back cover does not catch all the time, it is sufficient."
I think I've finally found the place where I'll order all chargers from now on.  Really nice product!
great one i like it
"Extremely well designed case, as expected from BlackBerry.<br />Useful, elegant, protects well the phone. Real leather. I do recommend it."
Good
Perfect fit and a lot of protection. Exactly what I was looking for!
"Not quite right die cut, but close enough.  Price is right."
I really enjoy my mini kick stand I call it. It helps me not hold my phone in my hand all the time. And I can charge my phone without just laying flat or propped up against something. It is a great buy and product. Thanks. And they came securedly wrapped and I was happy opening the boxes.
a bit out dated now
Works well. Delivered promptly.<br />Satisfied with product.
"This is a great case ! Received it today and am very pleased with the quality. It is probably a better case than ones I've seen in Walmart and target for 4 times the price. Well worth the money spent. I would certainly recommend to anyone. As for anyone saying it makes the phone bulkier, not really. It's a big phone. If you think the case makes it to bulky then you should have gotten a smaller phone."
"So far i love this case.  Not bulky, protects phone from my clumsiness, and the case fits the phone perfectly.  It's not flashy.  Just right for me.  Delivery of the product was prompt.  No issues.  Quality good."
"Does not work, failed to connect to all devices tested."
"very sturdy, protects well"
bought for a friend who really enjoys them for workouts and daily chores.
"Do not buy this. It has no provision to exchange neither the key blade nor the immobilizer pill, so it is utterly useless. I did get a refund, but then spent most of that on return shipping."
dont buy it waste of money
"Great case, heavy duty. I like it. I will recommend it to others."
The best for the Nexus 5 and protects it perfectly.
The LG Ultimate 2 LG L41C is an exceptionally great smart phone at the Amazon price (under $70.) and works very well with Tracfone.  I was able to transfer my previous phone number from my old Tracfone over to the new one along with all my minutes and activation time.  I would highly recommend this smart phone and Tracfone to any economy minded person who is wishing to avoid the high costs of long term contracts with major carriers.
Bought 2 pair and they loved them
Item was as described and works perfect. Don't let the low price prohibit you from buying!
Great gift
Durable
Excellent product. Works perfectly with my ipad3
The touch responsiveness is completely trash.
"My brother leant me his Anker setup when I took a trip to NYC this past June. Between consulting Google Maps and the NYC Subway Map, and just plain ole social media and web browsing, these activities placed a huge burden on my phone's battery life. I'd have to recharge it 2-3 times a day on average, 4-5 times a day during unusually heavy use. The Anker was a godsend. And their iQ USB ports charged my phone in about half the time it normally charges. The only downside was the stock USB cord that came with the battery; using the iQ port would transfer a lot of heat across the cord. Not to mention that the cord was relatively fragile. Later, when I bought my own battery, I also purchased their braided nylon cord with gold plating on the plug for a few more dollars. The battery works extremely well with the upgraded cord."
Gets extremely dirty VERY quickly and won't clean even after scrubbing. The buttons on the side broke off and the paint is chipping. Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it has protected my phone when I dropped it!
These don't &#34;latch&#34; into phone or USB so it is easy to dislodge and not charge your device.  I do like the shorter length.
broke quickly
great! super long cord and charges quickly.
"The one I got looked different then the picture. I though the case was gonna be black. It was a clear, thin plastic that felt like it was going to break when I tried to put it on. The print of the case looked old and discolored. The while lettering looked yellow. Was very disappointed with this case."
Fits
great one i like it
bought this for my nephew. He just loves it.
case did not properly fit on one corner and was very loose
This temper glass seriously saved my phone . I work in the culinary worlds and I am up and down all day so occasionally my phone will fall because of it and the rush. It is the best especially if you don't like bulky cars as I do not. This is seriously the best it's defector a must have.
So far it is looking great. Fits my tablet good and helps me hold on to it. Very thin so keeps tablet feeling thin and light. Would buy another cover in a different color if I ever want to have a change.
It started to break only after a week that it arrived in the mail. Then it just kept breaking piece after piece.
"I purchased this to make nail polishes, and it works GREAT!!!!! It's just the right size for nail polish bottles."
Good phone case. Easy to put together and take apart. Easy cleaning.
What a piece of garbage. I've never owned anything where the suction cup fails when adhered to clean glass faithfully every five minutes...the fail rate was the most reliable part of the unit.
"the most inconvenient nuvi of the 3 that we have had.  wish I had my old one back LM40 (was easy, sweet & simple). On the way to look at the 55lm manual again but really shouldn't have to after a year of use."
"This cable was exactly what I was searching for and had a very high rating. Upon reading the comments, I saw that a lot of the reviews came from reviewers that received this cable as a promotion. This was worrying to me, but since it was exactly what I wanted- I ordered it anyway.<br /><br />It was a good decision. This is my favorite cable I've ever used. It feels sturdy and syncs data. The ends feel like they're made of aluminum, the braided cable doesn't tangle when I put it in my bag and it fits my Otterbox Commuter case for my 6+.<br /><br />It's about a month later and NRGized (the seller) sent me an email stating if there were any problems to contact them and the cable comes with a 12 month warranty. Very good experience so far.<br /><br />I'll update this review if anything changes."
"This case is everything they said it was , I absolutely love this case !! I've been waiting for  awhile for the perfect case and I found it..Everyone asks me where I got it and they couldn't believe what I paid for it , so yes...I highly recommend this case !!"
"Cheap case, broke after the 3rd day."
Very clear plastic. Seems to be a quality product. Fits well and offers added protection without the bulk of some phone cases.
Lots of standby power and very comfortable and well made.
Works perfect
Good quality and excellent cost.
These are amazing! Seriously like a glass plate on the screen! But leaving the touch and HD perfect! Great!
This is our 2nd purchase of this charger.  My husband wanted one for his car too!  It does have a tightly coiled cord so you can't really talk easily while driving but we use blu tooth anyway.  We always double check that it is pushed all the way in every time we hook our phone up to the charger to make sure it is plugged in.  It does have a red indicator light to let you know that it is all set.
I was looking for a case that I could store my CC and DL so I did not have to put them loose in my pocket. This is perfect. It make me feel more confident that my CC and DL will not fall out of my pocket.
Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
So beautifully and conforme
"Nice size. Good build quality. Compatible with all my devices.  UPDATE: After 13 months of regular use, the folding prongs broke off. The unit is warranted for 18 months. I sent an email to Sunvalleytek, and they responded promptly confirming my device was under warranty and that they would send a free replacement. The replacement arrived quickly, and it works fine.  Still 5 stars. A good device, well built, and backed by great customer service."
"Purchased this case based upon a recommendation from a fellow realtor.  It makes life very handy to have everything at a touch of hand.  At first, talking on the phone was a bit awkward, it felt like I had my wallet on my ear - but soon I figured out the best was to wrap the strap around it so it wasn't dangling.  I get lots of compliments on it too!"
Excellent.
"I was a bit worried buying a capacitor from boss, as I know them to be slightly cheap. However I've had this cap for a few months now and its worked way better than expected! For the price you'll be hard pressed to find a better capacitor than this! And remember, you should have at least 1 farad for every 750watts to be safe, but having more than necessary is nothing but a good thing!"
"TechSkin for Note Edge was great, but for S6 Edge+, it was a mess. Cut-out holes aren't exactly where it should be and both edges won't stick."
"My previous case started cracking after a year and a half of use.  I ordered this one as a replacement until I eventually upgrade to a new device.  I was very pleased to receive my order a couple of business days later.  The estimated arrival window hadn't even started.  Upon opening the package I was pleased once again.  It came with a new screen protector, and also a handy stylus.  Only having one issue with the product, and it is more due to me not having my toolbox with me.  I can get 3 or 4 corners to fully come up over the edge.  One though, is trying to roll up and not pop out.  Once I go to the office tomorrow, I should be able to fix that.  Just needs a slight pry from a tiny flat head.  Overall, I am impressed with the quality, price, and shipping time.  Exceeding my expectations.  Keep up the good work."
"Nice product, feels sturdy, and for a cheap price.."
Great armband. Just know if you are a small girl with tiny arms it may not fit you. My barely stays snug on my arm.
It was what it is as it describes
Fast delivery and great product. Thanks
"Disappointed, as it does not &#34;support&#34; my I-Phone, and will not charge my I-pad."
Love it
sweet
This case is solid. I have no doubt my phone will be protected from being dropped between this and a glass screen protector. It fits the phone incredibly well and covers no important areas and the buttons are still accessible. A nice new phone case of high quality. The kickstand is also a nice little feature for me using my phone for videos. I received this item for free for a honest review. This is very excellent quality.
Did not work.
I fits really good nice grip aand feel to it
This is a very powerful power bank not those little sticks you normally see on the mall kiosk.  I have a Samsung note 3 with big battery so this is powerful enough. I can charge at least 3 to 4 times.<br /><br />The other thing I like is it looks so beautiful. The picture isn’t doing it justice. By the way it is made of bamboo with really intricate carving not wood.
Exactly what I needed for work.
"Even through I have only had it for a couple days, I have not found any flaws! This product is amazing! I love it so much! It also stretches to about 3 feet!"
"Great charger,  but first few hours the led display,  the center line across the led will no longer light up. *update* Parts of the display do not light up anymore. When I got a call about thfae product, I told them of the issue but they would not do anything for me. If you call to check then do something to fix the problem.,"
Love it.  Awesome.  Like the life time warranty it comes with
Theseare a joke. I tossed them in the trash. That fall apart and got in the way of driving.
The edge part of the screen protector kept peeling up after only a week.
"Love the concept, but it fell apart within 2 months.  The stripping along the edges started pealing off.  The cover for the card insert came apart so now the cards fall out."
"Honestly, I'm pretty disappointed with this case especially for the price I paid for it (around $20 including the shipping costs). It looked really nice to begin with and then started peeling and scratching within a few weeks and the thin plastic near the volume buttons cracked off. I've had cheaper cases that lasted far longer"
"Fits great, protects the phone great.  Only down side is some ear phone jacks don't fit through the case and require the case to be removed to operate."
"Very handy piece of equipment for those of us that are in our cars a lot.  It's a bit top heavy so the connection does come and go a little bit.  None the less, glad I bought it."
"Quite disappointed with the suction cup because it does not hold that strong. It always fell, if not on the dash board on the floor. I just put it aside."
I give this cable a 1 star.  It's expensive and still does the same thing other cables do.  The Lightning head gets popped off.  I got this cable as a gift and feel bad they spent 25$ on it when the outcome was the same.
thanks

"A little slick on the hard plastic back, but very good case overall."
"Yes, this item satisfies my needs and is working properly !"
"Absolutely loved it!  Did not give it a five stars because the JETech logo on the back is TOO LARGE.  The reason why people buy clear or transparent covers is so you can see the natural beauty of the phone.  Nowadays phones have gorgeous designs you don't want to spoil with an ugly cell phone cover, but you still need to protect your phone from scratches.  I would definitely recommend this product and would encourage to make their logo invisible."
"It looks like a nice band and I like the clasp design, but it didn't come with any directions telling how to adjust the length of the band, nor did it come with any pins to attach it to the watch.  I hope than I will be able to use it.  The vendor, Monoy,  has been extremely helpful, and proactive, in telling me how to adjust the band.  Since the band looks great, and I am impressed with the locking mechanism, I'm changing my rating to 5 stars."
Not excited with this one.  It has a cheap rubber I feel to it and it slips off too easily...made a mistake in ordering this.
"Given To Me For An Honest Review<br /><br />Sport Bluetooth Headphone, Aukey EP-B13...by Aukey have great sound quality when &#34;sealed&#34; correctly in the ear. The controls are easy to use.They are real convenient to carry as they automatically &#34;coil up&#34;  when taken off. Included in the packaging are:<br /><br />*  Aukey EP-B13 Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Stereo Headphones<br />* Instruction Manual<br />* Standard micro-USB charge cable<br />* Rubber ear nums of various sizes<br /><br />These are great to use while working out, jogging or just to listen to some great music.I love mine. These would make a great gift to give. We have 4 months until Christmas. You won't go wrong picking one up for yourself and a friend. I gave this item 5 stars but wish I could give it more because it deserves many more. I highly recommend this item to everyone."
"Mini size super battery. It is as small as a mini flashlight or close in size to a lipstick case but carries an 8 hour charge. And, it comes with the cables, you don't have purchase them seperately, what? I know! Plugged it in to my iphone 6 which was at 10% and in less than 30 seconds my phone was at 95%. Incredible price, super easy to use and does the job well."
Great!
"Case fits great and it's nice an sturdy, the only downside is the stand doesn't hold up."
it's a good buy! enjoyed using it.
"The product looked great and fit very well on the front. The back was slightly off and the letters didn't fit well with the camera so it looked a little poor. However, I gave it only 2 stars because it doesn't allow for the capacitive input from the top and bottom of the screen so I couldn't use the bottom swipe up which I use to get to the flashlight. Since this is one of the most common functions I use on the phone, I had to remove the front"
Perfect! Just what I was looking for.
"Great radios.  I used them a couple of weeks ago when I went on a road trip and some offroading.  On open highway/freeway, you get around 3/4 to 1 mile line of sight range.  The radios have a loud, clear volume unlike the FRS radios that you can get.  I used them for hours without the batteries wearing down.  I bought the programming cord for them too but have not programmed them.  I have not used them indoors so I do not know how far they will transmit.<br /><br />If you have been looking for a really great set of 2 way radios, these are the ones to get."
Item came as described. Only wished they had included a screen protector for the phone.
Fits perfect.
Kind of bulky but it does fit on the phone well.
Did not like it.hole for camera is in the middle of the name.cheep looking picture of the name.will not buy anymore covers from that company again.
This wallet is so cute and exactly what I was looking for. It even fits in my back pocket.
"Got this for my 3 year olds ipad mini, and he loves it. he drops it, throws it, and it has no issues keeping up with his lifestyle."
"Great smartphone, working in Venezuela 3G Digitel Movistar and Movilnet"
This was not the phone case that was shipped to me. The butterfly pattern is correct but the case pictured here is not what I received. The picture shows a ballistic case with raised rubberized corners. What I received was a simple plastic phone cover not what is advertised here. I am extremely unhappy with the &#34;Bait and switch&#34; that happened.
Good Protection
"Great product, great price and fast shipping"
great
EXCELLENT SERVICE GREAT
"Very good alternative to having to install Bluetooth in your car or truck. Especially since you can choose literally any station. However it would be nice if it had an external Antena because there is a constant static in the background unless you have the transmitter in the right position. Other than that, great product for the price!"
"If you're buying character vitamins, the characters are important, so I asked my daughter to tell me which shapes are in the bottle.  There's Gary, Sandy, Patrick, Eugene, and Squidward.  They taste like candy, not medicine at all, so I don't need to remind my kids to take their vitamins.  They ask me if they can take them, which is one less thing for me to remember.  Each gummy has thirteen vitamins and minerals, but it takes two gummies to make a dose for children 4 and up, which means one bottle is a thirty day supply for each child."
My Iphone is protected now :)
best phone I've ever had
"exactly what we needed, received in a timely fashion."
Adorable!
"very durable. i also get many compliments<br />the front lower-right brand label thing is actually a sticker, so i removed mine"
So far so good. It is essentially identical to the one it replaced from another company. That one stopped working after 7 months so I am a bit apprehensive about this one.
"I bought two of these thinking since they were pretty cheap I might need the other one pretty soon. I'm surprised the first one hasn't even stopped working yet! I'll have an extra in case I need it but for now I won't need it, and I got two for less than the price of one from Apple"
Cheap
Good quality with cheap price.
Awsome
"Very nice! I made a mistake and ordered the vase for s6 but needed s6 edge & the seller was great with getting right back to me & let me know they did have the case I wanted and would ship me the right case. It came right on time & my daughter loves it. It came with a screen protector, cloth, & stylus pen. The case really grips the phone perfect."
"I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. This case fit my galaxy s6 perfectly. I like the design and the ability to hold your credit cards, etc. Perfect and convenient.  Overall this is a good case for hiding your credit cards and not having to carry along your wallet. Perfect invention.  I recommend galaxy s6 users to buy this case. Loved this case!"
"Was a great charger... until it stopped working.  Only had it for 2 months and now whenever I plug it in, itll say that its charging but it wont.  Amazon says its past the return period, so now Im stuck with a dead charger case."
"Great price, easy to use.  I thought I ordered the blue unit, received the green one instead."
"The screen protector was not wide enough, did not fit phone properly!! :/"
"I absolutely loved this case! I got a lot of compliments on it and even though it's slim, it protected my phone when it fell."
I REALLY like these headphones. Crisp music for my workouts
The case broke within weeks. I did not drop the phone just broke near the vibrating switch hole.
Very good case
Love it.
happy
Fits perfectly and looks great. Only issue I have is the kickstand is hard to open.
It works well.
Great responses form our guys in the construction field
Great case offering that offers excellent drop protection.  Fits perfect and is very easy to put on and take off.
Very good
I love this case!!! Thank you so much!!! I highly recommend it
Saved my phone from a rock
Good
"I purchased two of these, one for each car.  Unfortunately, the magnet does not seem to be strong enough to hold a phone steady.  In portrait mode it works decently well, but will eventually pull to the bottom of the ball.  This mount will not work in landscape mode with either of my phones (Samsung s6, note 4).  When trying landscape, the weight of the phone rotates it.  On a positive note, I had no problem getting the ball to stick in either vehicle."
This product is awesome! I've been using FRiEQ with Polar Flow on my iPhone to record my swim workouts the past three weeks. My iPhone has been kept dry and I can check it between laps to check my heart rate and calories burned. Very satisfied!
"Well....I've had almost all of them, tempered glass, Zagg hd wet install...etc. I ended up buying this because I had it briefly on my gs6 and it looked great. I have an iPhone 6 now and was hesitant because of the 3 star rating. I usually don't write reviews but thought this screen protector deserved better than 3 stars. EVERY other screen protector I purchased for this phone had issues, halo, bubbles etc. With this protector if you follow the instructions it works perfectly. No bubbles, no halo, easy install, can barely tell it's there. It won't protect from impact, but that's not what I'm looking for, scratch protection suits me fine. You can't go wrong with this protector for the price, and proper install."
Wonderful! Really protects this small gem.
The  Anker charger  is the  BEST!  CHARGE  cell phone and ecig very Fast<br /> 4 electronic devices all the same time<br />Buy it!
Order the product on August 11th. The wrist-let strap just broke. Not satisfied with the quality the design and functionality are great though. Definitely prefer function over fashion.
when i first ordered it i was alittle nervous because i didnt see anyone else in the reviews so i was wondering if it was bad or good but its AWESOME... Got here on time it took me some a couple of kinutes to put it on but its awesome 😆😆. And it didnt come broken
We ate very pleased.
Works very well and seems very protective but I don't like how slick the hard part of the cases in my hand
"Love the charger, works as described"
"Cool design, comfortable in hand."
Worked out perfect.
Still doesn't hold a chage. Changing was easy but take your time.
It had a strong smell to it
I don't remember what I put this one in but it works well.
Like them but would not go out of my way to order them again. They are to worry. They don't lend themselves to being put away!
"I've been wanting to buy a selfie stick ever since it became popular and now I am happy to buy and use this particular selfie stick. Since I got it I was very impressed and I feel like it is a very high quality and nicely stylish product. It is also very simple to use even for me (I am not technical type) and work with my iPhone with no issue. Overall, I am satisfied with the product and honestly I couldn't find anything to complain about at all. Thank you for this great product!"
Small and light. Barely notice that I've added a cover to my G3.
I love this case!!!! Well worth the money and I received it much earlier than I expected...
"Nice, solid plastic case. Looks awesome, and I love the feel of the buttons. Makes this glossy phone a lot safer and easy to handle."
Great case
"Quick turnaround, just as described."
"Very lovely and fits perfectly. I wanted something that gave me a little extra grip without adding too much to the size and this fits the bill. Only downside is that the design is very rough in texture. I thought it would be under a layer of silicone so the whole thing would be rubbery, but the design is painted over the silicone. The paint, however, is not chipping or wearing off. I've gotten used to it."
Good to use when using your GPS on your cell phone
The case is pixilated and rubs off
"Very great case, fits perfectly and looks nice and sleek."
Had my case for a few weeks now... so far soooo good. Only bad thing is the flip part gets in the way of the camera. But I would still recommend this product.
"Super cute, and I find myself using the card slots more often.  Kinda wish it had an ID pocket, but the pen is nice. Has made video surfing easier as it works as a great stand.  But mainly the design makes it an A for me!"
"I do like this case a lot! After reading reviews and seeing that it splits apart, I am just waiting for that day. In the meantime, I love this case a lot, it is not too slim and can still grip it great. I hate the fact these phones are so fragile and have to hide it, but this case still protects it and can still see the design of this expensive phone!"
"I love the charging base, it is comfortable to wear. However it drops the bluetooth connection after about 15 minutes of being on a call. I know it's not my phone (Galaxy Note 4 running Kit Kat) my other headset stays connected. I got this to stay at the office and use on frequent long conference calls. Wish I kept the packaging to send it back.  UPDATE: I was sent a new headset without requesting a replacement, this one works great so I obviously had a defective one. Comfortable to wear all day and the battery makes it through the day as well even with marathon conference calls."
Works like expected.
As soon as I tried to put it on my phones screen it immediately made huge bubbles that wouldn't come out. I ended up just throwing it in the trash.
Case broke within a month
Fits the phone well and gives good protection .Easy to install .
Broke almost immediately.
"So far this seems to be a very solid case.  It has been easy been east to get on and off, it is lite weight and not bulky at all."
Item as specified.
very useful
"After less than three months my phone did not work. Sent it back to be fixed and they said they mailed it back to me 10 days ago, did not provide tracking information and refuse to respond to any emails. Not worth the money, I am trying to return the item for a refund for horrible customer service and a defective device. The device was overheating, would not hold a charge and after a few months I couldnt get service and my provider could not reset the APN's."
It was easy to put on and take off and has already saved the phone more than once
Works very well. Charges fast and works on a iPad 2 mini. Which is very picky about changing.
"I picked this phone for my teen who likes Google. His school uses it so he is familiar with their apps. We have other phones in the house, iPhone & fire phone. The phone comes with screen saver and a gel like case, without the case the phone feels like fabric on the back. The case is very thin and bendable. The headphones are ok. The screen is bright and easy to read from. The icons are very vivid, kid like and colored like jolly ranchers. My initial reaction was lukewarm,  I am a fan of other brands. But once I spent some time with it and got use to its different menu system and apps it actually is pretty nice for its price range. Camera works well and has a quick shutter. Power button is on the side next to volume, sometimes turn it off by accident. I do like the large screen. The teen likes it, and it's cheap enough to replace if lost or damaged.<br />Update: the FM radio feature allows you to record what your hearing and has a speaker function, although not room filling sound allows you to use the radio feature without your headphones on your ears. The headphones are the antenna. Battery seems to drain quickly, depending on how much you use and have screen on, this may become an issue."
Pos
Long lasting and a great product.  I recommend it.
"The Wildtek REPEL Waterproof iPhone 6 Case was packaged nicely, with a microfiber cloth, a wrist band, and clear instructions on how to test for waterproofness and case assembly. Unfortunately, I didn't get the chance to test the case, as when I observed it closely out of the box, I noticed that one side had a slight &#34;bowing&#34; (see attached photo), thereby not making a true seal when the two halves were snapped together around my iPhone 6. In addition, the tactile feel of the plastic was a bit too smooth, and overall, didn't exude the Quality as I had hoped.  A noble effort that fell a bit short on Quality control."
"It's pretty great, fit's perfect. It was a bit difficult to get on though and the top isn't completely closed it looks like because of how hard it was to put on the case."
"This product is exactly as described. You can't ask for better than that. One thing, it ships from China. Took 2 1/2 weeks to get to us. If you can wait that long, I recommend. If fits my bluetooth earpiece like a glove. :)"
"easy to put on, sturdy, durable case"
Love it
Absolutely beautiful!  My Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 fits perfectly.
Nice design and works really well.
Great Product and Service!
"Fits well and looks like it will give good protection.  I like the feel in my hand - a problem with some cases.  It does add a little bulk, but that's to be expected for a case of this style.  The cut-outs are perfectly placed and it's easy to use the side buttons."
Love the color
"Perfect fit, stylish and gets alot of compliments."
"I really like this design. The designer of this design I believe is Nicklas Gustafsson called \\""Wooden Navy.\\""  The design is also sold from Society 6, however their case doesn't fully protect the phone, here is the link [...]  I bought both of these products. I dropped my phone with the Society 6 case and it got a little dinged.  This case is light weight, feels good and protects the phone.    I paid $35 for the Society 6 one, this product I paid $0.89 for and a few dollars shipping. It said it would come in 2 months but actually took a few weeks.  All the buttons are very easily accessible. This case is actually designed very well above other cases. The original case designed by Society 6 does not protect the entire phone, this one does. Maybe the two makers of these cases can get together and design the ultimate product!"
"buy 2 , one would run a few weeks the wifi and then stopped when I wanted to make a claim had already spent time replacement"
"Battery worked good for about 3 weeks, then the case split open and all functions stopped.  Battery seems to be very susceptible to heat damage, as I charged it in the velour pouch they give you to carry it in, the case separated and functions stopped."
"Charges my android galaxy note 3 super fast. Fastest i've seen for any charger. Great feel, nice smooth color. very happy."
This gadget is GREAT!  I use all 6 ports on it.  It charges quickly.
I loved the color and the fit but they just didn't stay connected. I ended up sending them back and getting something else. It's a pain in the rear to be running and having your music constantly cutting out.
Good
Cord doesn't fit
"Made very cheap, don't waste your money!"
They work.
Love it! Very easy to install and provides a great protection.<br />I recommend it.
The only problem with this case is they send you a USB cord to charge the phone but no plug for the wall!!!! You may have to buy several till you find one with the right voltage or it will constantly beep at you. If your reading this life proof it is BS to spend over $100 and not be able to plug into the wall. Other than that the case seems to be excellent and the battery works great.
"When charging 2 devices the 2nd device blinks on and off as though you were unplugging and plugging in the charger, it does this on all devices that I have tried to charge.  Very disappointed."
"Excellent, Just That I Need, Faster Charge"
Great kit for camera repair.  Super easy to use and high quality.  I had my camera lens fixed in just a few minutes.
"WASTE OF MONEY. First, I am in the U.S. and I received this item with a wall charger that with a plug that doesn't fit into U.S. outlets, I'm assuming it's a European plug of some sort. As I was leaving for my vacation in 2 days I kept the device. THEN on a 3 hour drive using the car charger the entire time the battery died. Tried to remove the charger from the gps unit but it was STUCK. Finally pulled hard on it and of course the plug ripped apart leaving the metal piece STUCK inside the GPS unit. I am now on vaction with NO GPS to use and will be going to a local store to buy another one. SAVE YOURSELF TIME AND MONEY AND JUST BUY A DIFFERENT GPS UNIT FIRST!!!  On the positive side - I called Amazon once I returned home, great Amazon customer service, refund was very easy."
"I Traded in my old F 150 for a new 2015 Silverado. And I didn't realized how much I'd miss keypad on the Ford. So I started looking for something to put this truck. I did not want to drill holes in my new truck but at the same time I did not want something that looked all ghetto. A month later I decided to go with this unit because it was the most aesthetically pleasing unit i could find to fit the bill. Once I receive the unit. Quickly discovered it came in three pieces. First you get a window sticker (The face or number pad you see in the picture and on the outside of the window). Then the Unit it's self (The brains of the thing if you want to call it that). And Finally the wiring harness. The wiring harness is super simple. You got your basic power wires, lock and unlock wires and then (optional alarm arm and disarm). Realizing the window sticker was a one shot deal. I decided to bench test the unit before I started anything. The Unit it's self has a sticky side with backing on it. Where your supposed to peel the backing off and you stick the unit to the window sticker and you can actually see where the buttons of the unit match up with the buttons on the window sticker. So, I powered up the unit and touch the buttons. Very responsive through the backing material. Yey! Thats a win. Next step. I decided to mount the unit to my rear window. So it's kind of hidden but at the same time easy to get to. Ran and wired up the hardness to where I needed it to be. Then I plugged the hardness into unit. Was able program a 4 digit pin and the pulse for the lock / unlock functions.  And the unit worked flawlessly. Awesome Next step. Clean the window and apply the window sticker to the window. Then mounted the unit to the window sticker on the window. Thing works goodtill works. Because all The LED's still work but. Maybe my hands aren't warm enough or back window too thick. Either way unit does not work. And considering it's made up of stickers. I can't easily be remove to be returned it without damaging it. And since I just wasted my money on this little project. I can't really recommended for anybody."
Damn good product. Works well with my 2014 Moto X.
notter box
Works great I got it for my moms iPhone 6 and she enjoys the style and protection this case offers
"It hasn't passed the longevity test yet, but it works exactly as expected. I was able to power a counter-top oven with it (over 1200 watts) without issue. Well, other than the poor small car battery that was powering it started to dip in voltage after 20-30 seconds. When powering a 150 watt fan, I noticed the fan motor was louder with this than a standard AC outlet, which, I suppose is a product of the modified sine wave.<br /><br />EDIT (Sept 2016):  Still 5 stars! I've been able to power a fog machine (over 1000 watts) as well as an industrial cotton candy machine, which got very close to 1500 watts! This inverter never hesitated. Granted, the SUV battery powering it eventually cried uncle after 20-30 minutes (with idling). Keep in mind car alternators can't generate more than 400-600 watts worth of power at idle, so either use this with a larger battery bank, or for only short periods of time."
It does not fit. I have been meaning to return it. How do I go about sending it back?
"I like:<br />- Been through 3 or 4 drops onto carpet with this case, no damage at all.<br />- Sturdy construction<br />- Dust protection for headphone and micro usb port<br /><br />I dislike:<br />- Plastic case is difficult to slip over the rubber gasket at first<br />- No grip compared to my last (leather) case. The plastic is smooth. I've dropped it a few times because of this.<br />- Buttons are stiff and hard to push until it is broken in (maybe 3-4 months). Even then, you lose some of the tactile feedback of the button. Still worth it.<br /><br />Note:<br />- I'm not using the plastic screen protector. The Galaxy S3 comes with gorilla glass, so no need."
Great fit & meets use expectations. Very comfortable and easy to use touch screen. Would definitely recommend!!!
I love it
"Did not match up, had 2 order pioneer brand"
I broke my iPhone because of this case buy a speck or a tec 21
Perfect fit! print on case was slightly less brilliant than expected but still a fantastic case!
It Fit Great
"Works well, not fancy by any account, but I feel that my phone is safer with this thing on. Doesn't help when the phone goes face down on the ice, though."
Broke one week after I got it.
"This battery charger actually BROKE my better, original battery. After putting the original battery in this charger, the battery stopped working completely. I wanted to get a refund, but I wasn't able to since the original battery was destroyed and I had no other batteries on which to rely, and the return window was extremely short. Terrible made in China knock off product.  Update: The charger itself broke just over 3 months after I received it."
The best phone at the best price! only need more optimization with Android and the memory RAM
"As others have reviewed, this item is excellent quality.  I tried another similar arm band, giving me a benchmark - this one is WAY better, with a nicer feel, quality workmanship and nice features.  Since my 5'2&#34; and 110 lbs gives me puny arms, I had to cut off the second slot so I didn't have so much material on my arm. Now it feels comfortable.  Value can't be beat."
"After going through a few waterproof cameras that were pretty pricey, & didn't even take pictures that were very clear I decided to give this option a go. I figured at less than $15 this would be a great  deal if it worked & if not then I would definitely be sending it back.<br />Well....This waterproof pouch is truly AMAZING!!! I was VERY skeptical & did not get my hopes up too high (especially because of the low price), but after testing as instructed I was confident that my iPhone would be safe. My iPhone 5S has an Otterbox on it & fits perfectly inside with room to spare. I could even place our seasons passes for our local water park & our USB (for transferring purchased pics. at the water park) inside with my phone.<br />The instructions said to put a piece of paper towel inside, close, & submerge in a sink full of water for an hour or more. I actually filled a large bowel with water, sat that in the sink, opened my pouch, inserted dry paper towel inside, closed it as instructed, placed it in the bowl & then placed a smaller bowl full of water on top so it wouldn't float up, & left it for several hours. Sure enough when opened later that day the paper towel was completely dry.<br />I will admit ... even after the initial test I was still a little worried, so I didn't use it underwater on our first visit to the water park. BUT I have now used this pouch 4 times (once a week) at our local water park, testing it out each time before going, & felt safe enough to finally use it underwater repeatedly. We took several underwater pics. & video yesterday while enjoying the water, & all of them came out splendidly without any issues whatsoever. I would recommend always testing your pouch before using it for your phone (as instructed) since cellphones are not cheap. Honestly, I was quite shocked at how clear the video came out! The still pictures did not come out quite as clear, but they are still better than the last underwater camera I purchased (& I'm positive that has more to do with my camera more than this pouch anyway.) I have no complaints whatsoever.<br />The length of of the lanyard is nice as it hangs at chest level, & if you like it shorter you can always loop it at the back to shorten it as you would any other lanyard. It's light weight, crystal clear, & at this point we have not had any issues with condensation or anything else even in the HOT Texas heat. I highly recommend this pouch. In fact I'm thinking I may buy an extra just to have when/if I ever have issues with this one.<br />I have included a few pictures so you can see how clear the pictures really are. I love that we can even see all of the little bubbles & movement in the water as my daughter jumped into the water off of her Daddy's shoulders!more to do with my camera more than this pouch anyway.)

Love it!!
"Cheap, nice, works."
"This is more than I thought.  The convenience of the case, the look are very satisfactory and I would recommend it to all who buy the IPhone."
works perfect
Not sure why this is on my review page. I never have ordered this. I own only Apple products
Excellent
One of them stopped working which sucks. Other than that they are great.
Case fit phone perfectly clips onto pants nicely
"I've had this  case for several months and I've dropped my phone etc. the sticker has come off from the back but there was no sticky residue so no biggie to me. I use my phone a lot and this has kept it safe so far even through children throwing it, playing with it, and slobbering on it. This case is great."
I use this for camping to keep my iPhone charged.  I'm really happy with my purchase.  I like that there are size options and plan to get another larger unit in the future as an emergency power option for all the devices in the house.
It fades quickly
Perfect accessory. Worked so well on last trip. No slippage. Why didn't I get this sooner?
"It is great not to have to charge my phone every day, or have a low battery half way through the day of heavy use. Fits perfectly on my Samsung S4."
nothing is wrong
"I got two styluses that both have replaceable tips.  You get extra tips when you buy these styluses.  However, I bought extra tips in case they stop making this kind of stylus in the near future because I've had that happen before.  And as far as I know, the styluses only come in pink and purple.  Maybe they offer more colors now."
Works perfectly for iPhone 5.
"I have now purchased 4 of these units , they are amazing and truly a life saver in places that have limited power outlets . GREAT PRODUCT !"
Worked as advertised
the phone is nearly perfect!
Works great!
A stylish roomy case for all of your small camera needs.
"Very well constructed. I'm not a big selfy guy in public, but I purchased this for my GoPro, intending on using it for high angle shots. Timely delivery, I was very pleased with the construction and quality of the stick. Nice grip surface, WiFi case, and firm clamps for size adjustment. The bonus of the phone clamp came in handy during a family vacation. My teen daughter and wife both loved it, and I couldn't get it back from them till we were home. I have other Smatree products, all high quality, and this is no exception. Highly recommend if you need a versatile stick."
"If your phone supports fast charging thanks to the Qualcomm 2 chipset, you needed this yesterday. It charges amazingly fast. My HTC One M8 will go from near death to 100% in about 20 minutes, which is incredible to me. Got one for the car also and it also charges super fast. I would dock it a star for being such a plug hog in the wall, but it's the right height, and displaces it's size in width, leaving room for another plug."
Great
It doesn't cover the edges of my phone that well and cased my phone screen to get cracked
"My 6Plus was left on the roof of my truck, it well off, was run over at least twice, and this case saved it! Love It! had it for about a year, never with out my business cards. Incredible."
LOVE my case! It's beautiful and fits perfectly.
"This wall charger works very well with android phones! However, if you have an iphone, you should consider another option."
"I have to say this is one of my favorite cases! Ive seen alot with the glitter but none with the rhinestones. It fit pefects. Looks amazing. I love the little bow on it! Great touch!! Its very durable. Ive had no problems. I have dropped my phone with this case on it, and it didnt crack the case or my phone. It doesnt leak. Its all around an amazing, beautiful case!! I was given this product for a discount for an honest review! You will not be disappointed if you buy this case!!"
"It does get switched off sometimes, but overall a good product"
Great Price for 3 bands that fit good!
I've had a lot of problems with this phone and am not happy with it.  It won't save addresses correctly and I've sent products to wrong locations many times.
"Just as described, no defects whatsoever! Will buy from you again!"
perfec
"I wish this was longer,  to short for what i needed it for"
Awesome! Saved my Nexus 7 from being discontinued.
The sound quality is surprisingly bad; it gave me a headache.  I have several pairs of headphones that I paid about $10 for and they sound much better.
This screen protector is so useful! A must get!
Works exactly as it should and even charges my S6 with a case on.  It'd be 5 stars if it came with it's on plug in USB adapter.
Not great quality. Don't  like the way you have to hook it up.
100% recomendado
"Just got it, feeling pretty good about it right now."
It kinda didnt work after a few weeks and i got really sad but it works only if you place it a certain way...
I love it.
"As others have said, this is not space gray.  It is shiny steel black and does not at all match the space gray apple watch.  It might match the stainless steel in space black.  But that is a different color and this was not advertised as space black.<br /><br />If you go through the trouble developing a product you should probably know the color.<br /><br />Additionally, it did not slide into and out of the watch smoothly and was a bit loose.  it also uses harder to find 24 mm bands.  I tried 5 or 6 22mm bands at a local jewelry store and they were all too loose.<br /><br />Just not good enough to keep.  I returned this item."
Great phone!
Very comfortable to use. I have shoulder problems and this helps reduce the pain I live with. At least this mouse doesn't add to my shoulder pain the way a conventional mouse does.
Love it fits perfect gives great protection looks awesome very happy with my purchase.
Product as described
All Great
"The case fits really well, and it seems durable. The matte looks just like the picture, which is great!! Im in love with the case!!! I have an HTC one remix by then way."
good
This Garmin GPS has worked very well so far.  The rechargeable battery is a big plus.
"This started off as a promising product. Worked well once I set it up. However, once it gets a little warm sitting in the sun, it no longer works at all. The screen either flickers or doesn't turn on at all. Would not purchase again."
very bad - wrong items
nice
Excellent product!  Fast delivery!
"The charger is finicky when to work, and makes my phone act up while charging, the screen loses control."
great quality
Fit my 1999 prelude and makes it clean.
This is a bulky clumsy protector. May as well wear block on your watch.
"Purchased in March 2015.  Stopped working in August 2015.  Hey, no moving parts to fail.  The price seemed right at the time of purchase.  Now five months later it seems I've over paid.  Certainly would not recommend based upon my experience with this product."
Remember Matthew 7:21
"Phone is extremely heating on the back side while playing candy crush it seems unusual, lags are also there on the lock screen. Screen is heating while voice call. Battery is depleting rapidly while gaming like 20% in 15 minutes. My experience with yureka plus is going well."
I love this case. I collect owls. It is durable. I have drop my phone with no damage. Fast shipping. excellent packaging. I would buy from this seller again.
Good
Bulky but so cute!
"Very nice product. The leather is soft and the color is very pretty.  It was so easy to take the original band off and slip this in.  It's really in there, and I'm not worried at all that it will break."
I love the case and the shipping was very quick!
Love it
", the case fits the phone very nicely. It is comfortable to hold."
"Works wonderful, takes great pictures in the case. Phone calls are clear. Only negitive is that i find it hard to open."
"I'm extremely unimpressed with this product. I found the instructions to be very unclear, disorganized, and very vague, and the kit itself was very difficult to maneuver. I spent over 2 hours trying to put together the screen of my phone, with very little success. Additionally, the glass screen itself is very poor quality, and the display screen is extremely fuzzy. While it is great to be paying a portion of the price to get it fixed in a store, I highly recommend going to a store and paying the extra money to have someone do it for you, this is not worth the time, stress, energy, or risk."
Arrived with corner of glass cracked. Wet wipes included in kit did not do the job in getting phone clean. Worst screen protector I've purchased thus far.
The power strip is defective and doesn't work. I have emailed the company twice... waiting for a response.
Perfect fit and easy to install
I use with two 8 inch in a ported box wired in 2 ohms. This makes it sound much much bigger. Amp never complains!
Great item and it came by pretty fast
Simply great
Awesome thank you fast shipping
Instructions suck.  Need a better selection of screws....it was like a mix and match screw selection.
"Only used it for about a week. They work fine. They don't feel like the original apple cable, and you might find some measurement differences that are negligible: see the picture. But all in all they are worth the price and I am happy with them so far."
"very protective, feels great, just a little bit heavy. very well made."
"This product we received was NOT the product in the description. It was similar- but not enough for us to like it. The description states &#34; A locking swivel belt clip is easily locked into an extended position and provides different viewing angles while watching movies or video calls, also rotatable 180 degrees&#34; - however this was not possible with the case shipped to us. The silicone shell showed honeycomb grip interior in product photos, which was not what we received. The silicone shell also did not fit snug around the phone and was loose enough to look like it was not the right model for the phone - an HTC Desire 626s - which is stated in product description to be made to fit both 626 and 626s. All the buttons and cutouts for camera, mic, earbuds and charging were correct, and so was the outer shell and the front cover/holster fit nice and snug over the outer shell. Also in the photos it shows that the front cover / belt clip holster interior is covered in either felt or some other material to possibly help protect the phone screen. The product that we received was just the hard plastic interior. The item we received was ok - but we did not like how loose the inner silicone case looked on the phone (it appeared wrinkled around the edges when the outer case was applied) and were concerned it would slip off too easily and not provide the protection we desired. When the phone was inside the belt clip front cover/holster it did not feel like it would slip out but as the phone will be in the hands of a teen more than in its belt holster, this was a concern as well as the odd look it gave to the phone with the wavy/wrinkled look down the sides from the silicone not being a proper fit. We will be returning this product immediately and looking for something else."
Nice and durable
Surprising nice quality. Fits my macbook 2015 perfectly.
Case was exactly as described. Great Seller.
I love this case
👍
It is a case. Nothing special. It appears to be well constructed and will serve the purpose.
Junk. Only worked for 1 week
very clear!
"Let's start with the packaging - a tin, sliding case, lots of plastic, and cushioning wrap for something that doesn't break. It's not &#34;glass&#34; in the regular sense. It feels like plastic. That's not why I sent it back. Mine was cut a fraction too small, so that if one side lined up, the other side had a thin strip of screen exposed. It shows up fingerprints badly as well. I'm returning it and going back to thin, plastic film covers. I had one for my iPhone 5c and never had to use the other three sheets for almost two years."
These headphones worked for a total of 3 minutes before they only had audio coming out of 1 side. Looked for a solution online but couldn't find anything
"I ordered this case as a gift for my niece and she loves it, she said it made her phone look very classy and the stylus was an extra bonus that she enjoys.  However, I also ordered the glass screen protector which did not fit the phone, so I will be returning it."
It works as advertised.
"This is my second one in the past maybe 3-4 years, and after about a year or so they always stop working. They work awesome at first and sound great. Just wish it would last longer."
Awesome for women with small arms!
"Really cool, this thing has a really smart design."
"The LG battery I ordered for my cell phone works perfect. I am very pleased with the product, price and service."
Bought 2 by accident and hated both!
Got the one with the Confederate flag on it. He's from Georgia. He loves it.
come on time and performs as promised
"Had it sitting on a bed two days after I got it. Come back in a couple of house later, to find it sitting on the floor, and te little cover that opens and closes by the charger a lot at the bottom of the phone, was broken off. Now a month later, have not dropped it at all since that day, and the sidings are starting to come off.<br />Do not get this case. It is not worth the money."
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Stylus part fell off on the second day even though I was extremely careful. Do not buy.
OK but can walk away from the phone that far loose single
"Broke after 2 weeks of general use. Otherwise, this was the best case I ever used. I love the grip on the back, and it was very sleek. Even came with a free screen protector. I wish it didn't break tho :-("
"THIS IS A SUPER GREAT CHARGER SO FAR! I LOVE THE 3 USB PORTS, THE MOST I'VE EVER HAD IS 2! ALMOST EVERYTHING CAN BE CHARGING STUFF IN THE CAR INSTEAD OF FIGHTING OVER TURNS! EVEN THE ADULTS! IT SEEMS TO CHARGE FAST WHICH IS A SUPER PLUS!<br /><br />*DISCLAIMER: I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT FREE OR AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN RETURN FOR MY HONEST REVIEW AFTER USING IT,"
Good quality product. charges fast.
"Easy snap ones, kind of rubbery feel to it!"
Charges my jabra clasic effectively after my puppy separated the USB plug from the one it came with
This case broke in the first week.  It also did not protect my phone and my Iphone cracked.  The other Incipio cases are better.
Gets the job done but the rubber parts ware and eventually become detached if you're not careful.  Fully water proof though!
"Awesome band for the price and excellent customer service. To me, it honestly feels like the same quality as the iPhone bands. Will probably buy a couple more in various colors. Good stuff."
"AMAZING product! Exactly as expected, and a perfect fit for my Galaxy S6."
"This product was a complete waste of money.  The screen protector is nothing more than a thin film of plastic.  It is water proof, however, it is made of very cheap brittle plastic and lacks any durability what so ever.  Mine broke in the pocket of my dress pants after only a week. I never dropped even dropped it or had a chance to take it out camping or anything.  Don't waste your money on this."
I recommend excellent product . All very good
Nice
Works. I dropped it like 20 times already and it really protects your screen. I just wish I got the all black color
"Really disappointed in the stability of the swivel piece. Can't hold phone sideways, the only position that works is upright and straight ahead. Any kind of tilt and it flops over. Would not buy again."
"I originally bought this for my daughters Blu Studio 5 but i now use it for my blu life one X. The holes don't match up at all and I have to use my silicone case over the phone in the case but my daughter no longer needed it so at least it isn't going to waste. It has Two credit card slots, an ID card slot and a cash area."
The radio scanner works very well and I am enjoying it. The only draw back is the Battery life is a little short it only last about 4-5 hours other devices  similar  in  nature last about 8-10 hours. I am a retired Firefighter with 55 years experience and I like to listen to what is going on with my old friends and co workers.
"Poor quality - lucky you get three, pretty difficult to install - first time I installed it I was trying to fix a bubble and it broke.  The second one was fine, but after a while it was scratched very easily.  The corners started bubbling up so I bought an ArmorShield - don't bother with these."
"With four young boys, my phone gets dropped more often than I'd like. This case is fantastic and has protected my phone perfectly."
Stopped working after about 5 hours of use. Clicking noise unable to read disc.
Works great. Cord is long enough which is awesome.
make my life so much easier with a crazy cat that chews cable....recommend to anyone who has a monster pet
"I'm sure the speaker would work great if it was the one that fit my phone.  The speaker in the picture is not the same speaker that I received.  The speaker I received has a thin plastic piece sticking up about 1/2&#34; on the left side.  (outside of speaker facing you).  I did see the speaker I received in pictures from other companies.  If you need this speaker, cross your fingers and order.  I wasn't upset about the price, so I'm not going through the trouble of returning it.  I'm more aggravated that I have to wait another month for another speaker from a different company.<br />I did get this speaker about a week before expected date.  Good luck!"
It did not fit my 96 S10 as advertised but the return was painless. Extra star for that.
"This massive behemoth is able to charge my phone and tablet two times each. It is amazing however a little inconvenient to carry around, so it's inordinately for over night trips."
Bad quality.  Fell apart.
good product
I would not recommend ArmorSuit. It does not stick to the crystal on the watch. Look for a different solution otherwise you will waste your money!!
Charged great when it worked. Did not even last half a year.
It didn't last long broke to easy
Fits great without adding bulk.
Needs more pockets
"So far the bands seem to work great and I have had no problems.  The only disappointment I have is I thought I would get 12 different colors, but 4 of the twelve I received are black.  I would have given 5 stars if I would have received 12 different colors."
Great case. Extremely thin and my beautiful phone is still visible.
"It came exactly when they said it would, and worked perfectly."
The end piece seperated
"Fantastic product.  Luckily I haven't had a chance to test it for impact protection, but love how the coating keeps fingerprints way down.  Bought another screen protector for a different phone I bought for another family member at the same time, it does nowhere near as good a job."
Great case. Great protection. Would buy again.
👀
"Unfortunately,  these reviews come in after I purchased the screen protector.  This is misleading as it does not cover the entire screen.  What a waste of time waiting for this to be delivered."
Great
Had this case ever since I bought my s5. Has definitely done it's job protecting my phone.
Damaged upon arrival!
Good quality item.
"Love it. Works exactly how I wanted it too, and I don't have to reach into my flip belt or side to change any settings if need be"
"Great seller. Product was even better than I expected. Perfect for just grabbing the essentials when you're running errands. Very well made, and a great bargain."
Definitely NOT leather!!!
Great for keeping track of my problem fleet drivers.
"So, so"
Easy to use.
This broke after 2 pictures. Huge disappointment.
Works great. Very accurate product description.
Sturdy for the Iphone and I have dropped it several times and no cracks or breakage.
"this case is ultra thing. i love it. the back has a texture that makes it not slippery but it is not sticky at all. had it two weeks, love it."
"When put on correctly, it works perfectly. It fell into place and it didn't kill the clarity of the screen."
This STAND works great!!!!! 🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
Love it!
"It's a great case. Small, cheap, and simple. I recommend it to people who don't like bulky cases"
does its job well
"Charges just as it says it does, very nice that it recognizes what device needs what.  Took this camping, little long on recharge in the fifth wheel with a generator..3"
It was cute..n fit my phone just perfect...
"Great wallet case, fits phone perfectly and love the colors."
Lov to get another one
Bought this case for my husband and he love it. Thanks Amazon
Great
"The screen protector that I had on my tablet before was great and did its job well.  I dropped my tablet and the screen protector saved my devices screen from damage.  I was looking for the same screen protector that I had purchased before, but they are no longer available on Amazon.   I decided to give this product a chance and so far I am happy.  The screen protector arrived quickly and in great condition.  I opened it up and it includes an alcohol wipe, a dry wipe, and a sticker for removing small particles from your screen before applying the screen protector.  The quality is just as good as the more expensive one I had previously if not better.  It looks great, the cut outs are where they need to be, and the Samsung stylus works as it is supposed to.  I am happy with this purchase and I am confident that it will protect my screen in the event that I drop my tablet again."
GOOD.
Adorable and fits well.
"Only one problem with idems, it is not a slide out clip on case it is very hard to take phone out of clip need two hands to take phone into your hands from clip on."
"rubber encasement is great for shock absorption, holster seems pretty sturdy."
This case was great it is made with quality and definitely worth the price
Super quick charger!!!
"I brought this for my girlfriends Iphone 5s. She has a tendency of dropping her phones...on the ground, in cups of tea, pretty much any where and every where. In flip phones never lasted with her. so I needed a good case that would survive what would the equivalent of a world war that was cramped in the span of 1 year.  I picked the case up for several reasons:  1) the hard case, I need this SOB to last. 2) The soft grip, you know just incase you leave the phone on top of a subaru going 60 miles an hour, I'd love it if the phone would just say on top and last..(spoiler alert it did...) 3) it looked alright."
"Do not order this case!!! It is beyond cheap and it looks like they took a picture of a real Kate spade phone case and blew it up to fit this case. The wording is faded, the product is terrible!!!!! So disappointed"
"Good product, would recommend!"
Unit was warped.  iPhone wouldn't snap in.
No more searching for a plug outlet while on vacation!
Lost my charger for the shuffle. This came in just 2 days and did the trick. You gotta love prime.
just as advertised and prettier than the Aquapac I have been using for the iPhone. Aquapac does have a wide variety of bags for many different appications
just as explained
No it didn't last at all
This thing is great. I bought it because I spend a lot of time on a kayak fishing. I like to have my phone readily available but would hate to have to replace it because it got wet or I dropped it in the lake so this waterproof pouch is the answer. It works excellent!
"Delivered on time.... Clean, fully charged, very happy"
Fantastic Value
I love it
"Works well, I could not find this case when I searched for a case for the Note Edge, but seen a review and purchased it... the only case in my opinion. GREAT!!!!"
"Best car charger I have ever used! One of the only chargers I've actually had charge my devices consisistantly. I use a lot of phablet style phones such as the Galaxy Note Series and the One Plus One so these are some power hungry phones, other car chargers just cause these devices to discharge slower or keep a charge while this charger actually provides a real charge to my devices."
"The case is slightly too big for the phone. Although it does keep the Samsung s6's slim look, the actual phone shifts in the case and do not protect the phone at all."
Works great
"This fits my iPhone 5 perfectly and the armband adjusts so that I can strap it at any position between my upper arm and my wrist.  I use my iPhone when flying, so with the addition of the optional strap extender I purchased (Amazon), this allows me to mount the armband to either my arm, or just above my knee when strapped around my leg (sitting position) while in my flying harness.  The key slot is a nice feature, but one I really don't plan on using.  For someone who uses it for running or at the gym, it does make a lot of sense.  Price was very reasonable compared to the other two brands I had purchased and eventually discarded because the phone either didn't fit, or they were a hassle to use."
The quality of the craftsmanship is stellar; my favorite part is the cabling along the cord which makes it so flexible. Works perfectly with my iPhone 5s
"I'm a flight attendant and always on the go. I got tired of my phone running out of charge or afraid to use it because I may need it later in the day. So I bought this one.<br /><br />The battery case is super slim, is not bulky in your pocket and seems like it's high quality.<br /><br />Some days I'm super hard on my phone with social media, texting, reading, watching movies, listing to music an so on. With most people our phones have become part of us.<br /><br />This is a day I do twice a week; Commute to or from work which is a two hour flight and using my phone constantly. Might work another 5 flights that day with phone in and out of airplane mode, one and off, checking social media, catching the news, reading a book on the kindle app and a lot more. All of this has a major drain on my battery. Now after some days 20 hours long I still have at least 50% battery life and still going strong.<br /><br />I get asked daily about this case because it does look pretty cool.<br /><br />I am beyond happy with this."
It's a case. It protects my phone. It's not very clunky. I will continue to leave it on my phone until I no longer like it or I get a new one.
Was a gift for my daughter and she loved it
Nothing but paper material
Five stars because it does exactly what it says it will do. I had to buy both this and the<br />Metra Reverse Wiring Harness 71-5600 as the previous owner of my truck was mentally ill when he wired his aftermarket deck. Great product.
"We now have a year on 3 of these.  They are all still flawless.  Very easy to put on and we don't notice any difference in touch sensitivity and color shift is so slight it's just not worth talking about.  They've shared space with small screwdrivers, sharp mechanical pencils, keys, high powered ecigs and all sorts of hostile items too numerous to mention.....yet not a scratch on any of 'em.  I actually bought some spares and it seems I probably wasted my money.  There is simply no reason to replace them and if it ain't broke don't fix it.  I've found that Charmin TP is absolutely the best cleaning material for this item...........don't know why, it just works.  Good job Noot and Amazon....thanks"
Great Product!!! fast Shipping!!
"i have been eating right and lightly working out. I was using my cell phone but at work a walk and knew I was burning calories but I don't carry my phone on me. I was talking to my husband in passing and than a few days later it arrived. I was so shocked... And in pink!!! I love pink, I'm like a bull with pink. After a few days of using it my husband saw how happy I was and decided to buy one for himself in blue. We love them!"
Good product would like a protection or the front
"Amazon's products never let me down, the lightning to USB product are great prices and work just like Apple products.  Great job Amazon!"
Love it . This usb matches my phone case. I am glad i ordered it. It works perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy 5 sport. Thank you will buy from again in near future.
These are great! Have 2 of them!
Perfect little gadget
"The &#34;genuine&#34; Apple OEM charger is not an Apple charger.  It worked the first day, but charged very slowly.  Now when I try to charge you get this message that it can't be charged."
Fits phone great but the loop in breaks. I have gone though three. They last for about 4 or 5 months.
"Easy to install, even for an older person.  Looks great"
Great case for the price. Doesn't add any bulkiness to the phone and has a nice grip.
Love it!
"Great product. Looks great, feels great in your hand and very sturdy. screen is clear and still sensitive to touch. well done."
Nice
Great product. Thanks.
great
"Rec'd phone 20 days after order was entered.  Works on the bands / networks / wifi, as stated. Better than expected battery life.  FM would be better if headphones were not required for antenna and if they used 3.5mm jack instead of micro usb/charge port.  Unit was rec'd 2015-0822 with an OS updated to Kitkat 4.4.2."
Belt clip broke after 3 days. Kick stand is useless won't support phone.
right after I posted favorable review I noticed it was broken.
Wish the magnetic clousure was more secure. Overall i enjoy the case. The credit card slot is perfect but of you put too much it won't close. The most I put is my id and 2 cards.
As expected
"I don't write a lot of reviews, but this case is awesome, so I had to. It actually makes the note 5 more comfortable to hold. It has a nice feel and is well made. Grips the phone tightly, however simple to take off to clean dust and build up under the case. I bought this exact case when I had my S6 edge and it fit awesome on that as well. Don't hesitate, buy this."
"I had it for less than a week and it has already stopped charging my device.  Delivery was quick which was great, I just really wish the product still worked."
"Terrible. Way to big for even the LG G4 with an otterbox attached. To make matters worse, the opening has no method of closing so that when you're running your phone or whatever else you have in there could fly out at any second."
Wonderful product. Great delivery turn around time!! Very pleased with the price and quality of the product!
it worked good for a month... now its pealing back
"This is a well made selfie stick that feels solid in your hand, and it stays feeling solid when fully extended, supporting the weight of the phone without difficulty.<br /><br />To extend the stick, simply pull out as many sections as it takes to get the length you desire and give them a little twist to the left.  Fully extended the stick is about 3'.  To collapse the stick, give the sections a little twist to the right and push them down.<br /><br />Included in the package with the stick are the remote with battery, phone clamp to use with the stick or tripod, mirror you can attach to back of clamp, small tripod, stand for the  camera, and a GoPro adapter which in my case came without the thumb screw.  But that is not a problem for because I don't have a Go:Pro.<br /><br />To use the stick you screw the clamp onto the stick after deciding if you want your phone to  be horizontal or vertical.  The clamp is designed to give both options.  The photos can then be  taken using the Bluetooth remote.<br /><br />Although I have mixed feelings about remotes since it something that can be lost or forgotten, this is a nice one.  I like the fact that it has an on/off switch so that battery doesn/t get used up prematurely.  But if it does, no problem.  It is a common CR2032 and widely  available..  Amazon has pages and pages with buying options.<br /><br />The  small tripod is also nicely done.  Take the clamp from the tripod and screw it on the tripod, then take your photos with the remote.<br /><br />Finally, if you don't want to use the tripod, use the kick stand.<br /><br />With three options, selfie stick, tripod, kick stand, this is most complete selfie stick package I have seen, and everything is well made.<br /><br />A nice sleeve is also provided for storage.<br /><br />Sample provided at a reduced price for purpose of review."
"I kept my old 3GS and decided to let my (then) 3-year-old play with it because I was tired of my phone being taken from me. As most 3 year olds are, she was rough on it, and I just knew it was going to break. Since the phone is so old, I doubted I'd find a good case, but was very pleasantly surprised to find this one. It has saved it from damage and has the added bonus of being a color in which my daughter delights. The only issue is that I can't use the docking station to charge it anymore because of the thickness of the case... but the wall charger works just fine."
"I used the phone in India.Right size to carry around and needed no alterations.Excellent reception,and clear sound.<br />Used for a month and quite happy with it."
nice
Great replacement battery
Good sturdy case.  Fit like a glove!
"Exactly what I was looking for in a TPU case. Sleek, elegant, thin, light, and all without sacrificing protection. I hate bulky cases, but I also hate broken, chipped, or cracked glass. It is hard as heck to find a case that is thin and light that offers any real protection. They're usually too bulky in all the wrong places, and sometimes not enough in the important places. This one is a real nice balance. Would buy it again in a heartbeat."
Perfect cover for my ASUS phone....
"I purchased this because it was partially transparent and it shows off the vibrant blue color of my ipod touch 5. It is VERY easy to put on my ipod, and fits like a glove. The silicone material provides a nice grip and it does not slide off. It is simple, yet still protects the ipod well. I would definitely buy again!"
"Great product, last as long as the OEM battery"
"[[VIDEOID:707cf6246cd1ab02536589a3e25d71c3]]I am forever losing (and leaving behind) my wall plugs. So I opted for these as they came in a set of two. Honestly I need one for every room in the house as I'm attached to my phone and charging is something of a routing throughout the day.  What I loved about these is the indentations on the side. They made it easy to plug and unplug- I was able to grasp it with minimal slippage when removing them from the outlet. They are small and compact- easy to toss in bag or pocket for traveling. They arrived in a simple but basic packaging but truthfully I liked the less packaging- less waste. Now I have a little concern with them getting `warm', however all my gadgets are plugged into surge protectors for extra security. Overall my phone charges just fine and I now have two more to replace the ones that magically disappeared. I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I am offering my 100% opinion and review whether it is good or bad. The opinions are of my own, from my own testing of said product and no other compensation, whether paid or otherwise, was given.  #TQR"
Does not fit HTC phone
"I initially bought this for a road trip this summer and it was amazing.  We do have an outlet to plug it into in our truck so I could charge both our phones, both our iPads and both of our motorcycle Scala Rider headsets all at the same time!!!  It was perfect.  Now I am using it at my desk.  It really streamlines all the devices I need to charge and makes it less messy and more organized.  Fantastic!! Thank you!!"
Can't tell the difference
They worked for about a week.
"THIS IS REAL NICE HOLDS YOUR CELL PHONE ON THE VENT VERY EASY TO MOUNT . REQUIRE VERY LITTLE ASSEMBLING . NOT LIKE A LOT OF THEM YOU GET AND HAVE TO PUT ON DASH AND THEN THE STUFF USED IS STUCK UNTIL YOU FIND SOMETHING TO TAKE IT OFF WITH . THIS IS VERY PORTABLE YOU CAN PUT IT IN ANY VEHICLE . I PURCHASED THIS CAR MOUNT AT A REDUCED PRICE AN EXCHANGE FOR A TRUTHFUL AND UNBIASED REVIEW .[[ASIN:B00QAXY27S Car Mount, Nexcon Magnetic Cradle-less Universal Car Phone Air vent Mount Holder for iPhone 6, 6 plus, 5, 5s, 4, Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge S5 S4 S3 Note 4 3, HTC M9 M8, LG G4, G3, Black]]"
"It's been awesome! Loved the case it came with, very happy with it."
"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
"Easy to put on, nice and brightly colored. Gave it away to a friend, so don't know about longevity, but it felt nice."
nice
Great mount.  Keeps GPS on dash without sliding.
"this is my second one! I purchased this exact same cover previously, but ruined it by getting tar on it!"
Absolute trash.  This cable feels cheap and does NOT charge any faster than a normal $2 cable.  Don't believe the hype and save your hard earned money for something actually worth it.
Does a great job. Very satisfied.
Good quality and the picture is not rubbing off.
"junk, never even worked"
Phone sucks
"Not the best case, but one of the few that fits the wireless charging back cover for the S5. It fits quite well and the material seems decent enough."
nice as expected
"Looks great, fit very well. Happy with the product."
Nephew loved it
"Great fit for the original (non-AT&T) Passport. Good texture for gripping, and good dimensions to let you place the phone face down on a dusty table without the screen getting destroyed. Same for the camera on the back of the phone."
"Excellent protection for my Samsung Galaxy phone.  The case is made of durable plastic.  I can't tell you how many times I've dropped my phone and the case has saved my phone from damage numerous times.  The only thing is, once it's on, it's a little difficult to take off.  You have to remove the white case first before you can remove the black case as it is in 2 pieces.  I guess this is a good thing but a bit of a pain if you have to remove it as I have, in order to remove the battery to reset my phone."
Came faster than I expected for a shipment from across country And it works great in the sun!
Works well
love it! and got here right on time!:)
"Great case, protects my phone very well.  True test was when I dropped my phone and nothing happened to my phone."
Nice case
ok
Cannot not get to since correct
works perfect
"Update to original review.  My concern was that without extension nibs the plugs would be hard to remove.  As it turns out, they are very easy to remove even with a thicker case.  No problems at all."
I receive it on time I  working good with that  SamsungTelephone
very cute but would be better if held more cards
"It does the job alright and it's cheap (price wise)  Buttons are kinds stiff to push, meaning you have to press hard for them to work, my original Jeep remote that worked was more accurate feeling and just the right pressure to push, but it works."
this is amazing quality and it came fast!
Cheap crap
I bought this for my dad..he loves it and the color. What a great buy for the work he does!
"There are better priced, more user-friendly products available relative to this product."
i really love this product i couldnt wait for it to arrive  as i love pink! it fit on my phone perfect! the pink color is beautiful and looks great on my phone! i received this product free for review and i definitely recommend it. its so cute!
WAY TOO BIG
One month.......good so far.
the pressure of the water cracks it in like 7 ft of depth
Its horrible. The flap won't close and it make the phone awkwardly big.
The top piece keeps coming off.  I would not recommend.
I used this device at extreme conditions (below 0ºC and above 4200m) for about a month and it performed extremely well. I really like this product!
If I don't have my phone close to the ear piece the music fades in and out... The fast forward and rewind button only work sometime. As far as the sound quality it's great.
"At first this case was great. It looked sleek and looked perfectly, however over time this case has literally fallen apart. I have gone through 4 of these things all replaced under warranty but decided to get another brand after my last one died. The button can stop working, the kickstand breaks off, the case chips easily and the case stopped charging my phone when plugged in. Works well in the short run, but get ready for it to break after a month!"
"It's a cute case, but when I received it in the mail the gold part of the phone case was not attached  to case. It's cheaply made and doesn't fit completely on one side of phone. Company reached out to me for feedback and told them same story. No one responded, not even for an apology. Needless to say I will not buying any future purchases with this company."
really increased my picture taking.  love it
This is a phenomenal case! I bought this to replace a case that was not able to handle my headphones. This case has solved that difficulty and it’s very thin yet constructed to protect the Galaxy S6 with none of the bulk.<br /><br />I got a glass screen protector and I feel more secure as long as it doesn’t fall in a river. Additionally I love the clear color.
"Came in ahead of time, fits perfectly"
I love my case.....fast delivery as well
GOOD STUFF
Great product.
"Unlike some other &#34;certified&#34; cables you can get through Amazon, these actually work, every time I plug them in. I like that this is longer, and actually sturdier, than the original Lightning cable that came with my iPhone 5s."
I think mine were broken.  The high frequencies didn't come through.  I sent mine back.
"It may be my cell phone needs to be upgraded, but it seems that the charged batteries life expectency has diminished. I can not keep it charged that is why I purchased 2  batteries to insure I can keep the cell available."
"Color, and the phone does not match."
"I bought 1 of these and 3 months later, bought an additional one. i used them for a 30hour road trip. I found that they were more effective than using the car charger. I found that as with any charging, it was best if minimal apps were running while charging and it would charge fast. I could get a 50% charge on my Galaxy S4 in about an hour when not using it."
Great case!
good
It works great. Just wish that maybe there were air vents for the summer. Sweaty
"excellent quality strap with low price, timely delivery"
"Happy with it.  I've used a few times now, and it does a great job.  Is the same size as my phone, so they fit together nicely in my pocket or purse pocket."
Nice
Awesome band. Good quality
They are very cheap and the rubber comes off very easily they barely work
This is a very cool and handy device I even bought one for my mom as well I can't believe how small it is and has many ear plugs to choose from for a comfortable fit. oh I also bought one for my father so actually bought three total. a very cool item to have I highly recommend to get them!
"Bought back in April.  Yes occasionally it does make high pitch noise, like a mic at karaoke night, but it is not often and it does stop on its own. Yes, it is a BIG case, but the iphone6+ is a BIG phone!  Yes, the rubber nubs that close off the charger and headphone areas are a pain in the butt and it is best to open them using the little chili pepper thing that comes with the case. Yes, they eventually broke off, so the phone is no longer waterproof. Yes, I have dropped it at least 7 times while in this case, No it has not suffered any damage during this time. Yes, the stand broke off last month, so it only lasted around 4 months of constant open close use. Yes, the chili pepper clastic thing is stupid, but it does work as intended, and i have had it tied to the core that it came with to hang off the corner. No, i have not lost the chili pepper this whole time. NO, it does not easily slide out of your pocket, front or back. Again, i think the phone size is more of an issue there, that the case. YES, you can use the thumbprint option, and it does work well, until month 4, it has started to wrinkle up and it takes a few tries to get it to read your print now. Can't give it a 5 since it is falling apart now, but giving it a 4 because it was $30 and it has lasted almost 6mo and has protected my phone form falls."
i love the fact i can listen to the songs on my phone by using this device.it works perfectly
Thoiught I bought a different item.  It turns out this will work also.
I broke it in like 4 days. But I dunno if it's just me or the case.
"So far so good... bought 2 just because I got a promocode and got it really cheap. Although it was only $10 with the discount, it was easily worth $20 and for sure. So far after several months, its good for what it does. No complaints."
its doesn't hold charge well
Its a 50/50 chance that the microphone will work. All the blue colors that i bought had non-functioning microphones.
One of the best most fun cases I've ever had!
"I'm not big on trying to &#34;sell&#34; something - but I can tell you that I have had 3 different UP bands - have always upgraded to the next one coming out and I have been extremely fortunate in that I picked a &#34;great&#34; tracker, I am also fortunate in that Jawbone Customer Service is the best.  I love the slim design of the UP2 - the clasp took me a couple minutes but I can get it off and on with no issues and  love that I can adjust it.  The &#34;tapping&#34; took a bit to get used to but once you do it's great.<br />If I had any complaints it would be the charger - it's probably me but I rarely get the charger hooked to the band the first time.  I tend to have to mess around with it to get it into a position on my desk that I can actually get it to start charging. I'll work that out in time.<br />I give this tracker an A+ and an A+ to Jawbone Customer Service."
Works well he cord is sturdy. Lasted longer than Apple product but still split at the end after a long period of use.
I am pleased with my purchase of the Dynamics Wall Chargers. I need extra because I want to plug my phone into outlets in different parts of the house without having to move the charger around. These work just like the ones that come with my phone. They are made better than the ones found at local discount or drug stores. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
was good untill it broke but i was rough with is so it was a miracle it lasted as long as it did
"Love it, has done it's job and some!"
Works great!
"Works just as advertized and charges faster than I anticipated, considering they are supposed to perform that duty at 60-70% of direct charging (probably my imagination).  Very nice low-slung profile that fits my Galaxy S6 almost perfectly.  Had it about a week, and no problems so far."
"This charger absolutely does NOT fit the Galaxy S4 battery. I bought it without reading the reviews, and regret the lost $5.99."
"It is cheap, and it makes the screen look a little cloudy, its not bad considering there are not a lot of screen protectors for the Nokia."
"This is the second one I got after the first one crapped out on me. Just stopped working one day, just like the previous one did. Will never buy again."
Very happy with his product
When I just bought it I loved it because it's so difficult to find this specific color in cases.<br />However the case turned terrible after only THREE days of wearing it. The color started coming off and the rest turned very dirty and impossible to clean. DON'T BUY IT.
"The batteries are great.  I am a rather heavy user.  My battery might run dead about 4-5pm during a work day when I have a battery saver app running...the battery would run dead at 12pm if I didn't.  (in comparison, my friend, who has the same phone, has battery until night).<br /><br />It is hard to compare these batteries to the OE battery because of the added apps, etc through the years.<br /><br />I can say that the batteries are NOT cheap batteries.  They last just as long as my 1 year old OE battery.<br />The addition of the charger is great!  I always have fresh batteries ready.<br />Also the charger has a USB slot for charging an additional device...which is a great extra benefit when you are traveling."
My dad was happy
Works great and I don't have to be concerned about having a new phone!
Nice and slim.
"Great hardware, but android 5.0.2 is horrible. I wanted to love this phone because of the value it provides, but it's just a miserable experience with 5.0.2 and motorola is not clearly communicating when the phone will receive 5.1.x. It can take 20 seconds to switch from app to app or open apps due to 5.0.2's memory management bugs.<br /><br />I bought a used nexus 5 and I'm MUCH happier.<br /><br />Nexus IS android. Everyone else is just a middleman vendor that will end up frustrating you with non-support for your phone (be it security patches or just OS upgrades).<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get a used nexus 5."
My granddaughter was excited to use th stylus' but highly disappointed when she found they had tears in end.  One was totally collapsed on end.  They are not useable.  Waste of money.
Great for price only been using one at the moment but the head where you plug it in your phone slides off and on but still charges phone fine
Doesn't quite fit with my case
The edges don't stay down. Will return
Great item.<br />Very sturdy feel to it.<br />Has charged IPhone S5 and Samsung S6 at the same time with out any problems.
"Although I really appreciate the fast delivery of the product, it was a little misleading. According to the information as described and matching photos,  I was looking for the black covers/tips to come with the clear ones that were delivered. Other then that, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
"I bought these earbuds, and I have such small ears that most others done stay in ears...even just walking. But with this, I can move in every which way, walk, jog and move my head back and forth and they don't budge! Great value! And I love the Bluetooth feature so I don't have to worry about a long cord bouncing around or getting tangled! Highly recommend!"
"I didn't work to expectations, it would connect  with SD cards whenever  it felt like, much less with USB connectors."
Sound quality is horrible
"Product was received for free in exchange of honest opinion. this is one of the most fancy car mounts I have had. it has a nice and specific shape and holds perfectly any type of device, smartphones as well. It is heavy and the package was really good. This product offers a lot of stability and protection for your phone while used in the car. I really like it."
Great Bluetooth headset with professional processes and shipping. Very easy to connect to Bluetooth and the sound quality is great. I love using them when doing yard work around the house and when exercising. I did receive a discount and recommend these speakers to anyone that loves music has much has me.
Works perfectly with my iphone 6.
Great charger! Awesome light!
It was great
The item arrived as expected and os wprking fine
Nifty phone holder. Perfect for my Google maps app.
"This is an awesome GPS case, it fits my new Garmin GPS and charger with no issues, and protects it and gives me an easy place to store my GPS and charger during trips so it will not get lost, forgotten or stolen. I am sure this case is just as good as more expensive cases."
Connects immediately. Turns on and off by it self. Couldn't ask for anything more.<br /><br />The only minor complaint is that the adhesive for the magnetic disc doesn't stick in the heat. But I can't hold the 100+ degree heat against it.
Great
Man BlueAnt has really dropped in design and quality. This was glitchy from the get go.
Fast delivery and works perfectly!
LOVE IT... It's everything I need.
Where my Fitbit all the time and I almost lost if three times. I was really lucky to have found the Bitbelt. Very inexpensive fix to an expensive gift from my children.
"My favorite case for iPhone 6 Plus!  I've bought three!  There was nothing wrong with the first one - that phone just got stolen :(  So I bought two more for my new phone.<br /><br />The bumper on this case is the business!  Yes - it makes the phone a little less streamlined than some other cases, but I feel like the protection is awesome.  It also makes an already hard to handle phone a little easier to grab on to."
it is very bad product. please do not buy this if you want somthing that you can hear and be heared.the only thing its looks nice and it hold well on the glass but as a speaker it worth NADA.
"Works really well but the instructions aren't clear at all, it's sorta self explanatory though."
Overall the case is pretty good quality<br /><br />It doesn't perfectly fit the standard droid turbo with a little headroom at the top. It also feels a bit slick which worries me sometimes because I feel like I am going to drop it.
It's great I use it everyday makes it easier to hold my cards instead of taking my purse everytime
Fast shipping and wonderful product !
"Grabs vent tightly, magnet is very strong even behind phone case. Phone stays stable and in position during driving."
"Charger will not fit with case on unless it is the original charger that came with phone. I have only had the case for a month or less, it has already started falling apart, cheap plastic"
"Great case. Protects the phone well, even the corners. Has enough of a lip to really make a difference while still remaining thin and durable. Nice product."
Item was not as picture shown the dimensions are off
good for adventures and being out for long periods of time.  Use it to charge my speaker when out by the pool or beach.
I loved these. They are comfortable for me since I dislike using ear buds.
Didn't like it looks different from the image
The phone was very good but I returned it. The screen came slightly damaged. May have been a factory defect. But the return was possible and everything was good.
"I bought this primarily for mounting one of the small dual band ham transceivers which have flooded the market the past couple of years and for this purpose it works quite well. It fits tightly enough in the cup holder and is sufficiently sturdy to handle the weight (about  6 oz) of these radios. Due to the position of the side controls on the radio I have to clamp the radio only by its bottom half which means I'm using only the top half of the clamp and am not using the bottom feet at all. Nonetheless, it holds the radio securely even when using the keypad. Of course, it handles my Galaxy S6 with no problem. I question whether it would work well for much heavier radios, but that's not what it's designed for so all in all I'm totally satisfied with it."
I purchased this twice. Both times it cracked/shattered within a week. Very disappointed.
"Its a nice screen protector, but the glue used is sub par. it has already began to raise on the edge of the phone."
I've been looking for a phone case for my Galaxy S5 for a while now and all that I could find were boring. This one had me a little worried at first since my experience with gem stones on phone cases had never been good since they tend to fall off easily.<br />This case not only looks cute but it's made of quality. I'm not sure what they used to get this gem stones on and to stay on but whatever it is it works! I can actually put my phone in my pocket without my phone case falling apart.<br /><br />*I received this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review
It is charging-really nice .
"I was involved in a motorcycle accident, at 65 mph.  My bike slid five lanes of traffic and I slid three.  When I popped up, the phone was still secured to the mount with the bungee strap.  Very impressed with this mount that I'm going to buy it again for my next motorcycle.  Awesome product.  Highly recommended."
great
"This was easy to install, but I'm disappointed in the fit.  I ordered the same shield for my husband's Galaxy S5 and that had a perfect fit.  This does not even completely cover the screen."
very tight hard to get on and off
"Nice case. It protects well, fits credit cards and more. Love the color and everything about it."
"I'm beyond thrilled with this product!<br />My hands are really shaky so I could put it on 100% straight but it's so pretty! I just put it on and already received so many compliments, not to mention the extremely fast shipping 😍<br />It's worth every peny!"
Crap phone
They are great.  I now have a charger at work and a long enough one next to my bed.
Got it in the mail and won't charge my phone
it is not quite as bright pink as I thought it would be but it is a great case and I do love it.
I like the phone it is as good as any android I have used. I am currently researching how to use it's cloud features with Gmail back office apps due to the fact it does not handle things the same way the android phone does for those that use Gmail as a UC system.
"If you wear hearing aids, this device is worthless. Even with telecoil, the volume is lower than normal and it does not separate background noise, obviously. Can't speak for normal hearing users."
"This is the worst SHEILD, I have ever purchase. It's has air bubbles all he way around it."
Dropped many times already and not a scratch on it
ok
Great
This product worked great.  I used it with both a Samsung Galaxy S2 and S4.  Everything including the NFC worked as it should.  I really had fun with it and look forward to new apps being released that I can use it on.
It was fine now I don't work at all
Received the tempered glass screen protector on the day they said it would arrive. I have a moto g 2gen and this product fits perfect. So easy to install. I love this protector its crystal clear. It also has a lifetime warranty which is one reason i decided to buy. Would definitely recommend this to others.
"Very timely delivery and exactly what I needed. The best part? The very next day after I put it on my brand new iPhone 6, I absently left it on the hood of my car and drove off. After realizing it, I drove back and another car was parked where I previously was. For the amazing part.... My phone was face-down and under the tire of an SUV!!!! The only thing that happened was the plastic screen protector I had on it was slightly cracked. That is it! I have always swore by OtterBox's and now I am both awed and a lifetime user."
Very pleased with my Benuo leather case for my iPhone6. Love the feel and look.
Tabs broke easy
Thanks!!
"awesome, very useful"
Real deal. Charges very quickly.
I researched a ipod holder for my car for a while before deciding on this one.  It's been a good choice.  I've had it for about a year.  It is pretty adaptable so you can position both the arm and the apparatus at whatever angle you want.  It isn't super heavy so it stays in place well.  I would recommend this product.  UPDATE: One drawback - there is a styrofoam-like substance glued to the edges of this (softening the area where the ipod slides in).  After a hot summer I noticed it was peeling away from the plastic.  I had to glue it back on.  More ofa nuissance than a major drawback tho.
"Very good, it is perfectly design to protect the lcd display."
"I received the samsung s4 , charged it,  but when I turned it on it powered down by itself and the volume turned off and on.  I couldn't use it at all so I returned it.  Was very unhappy with this purchase."
stopped working
"it has a lot interference when playing. I had to eject and reloaded again and again. Finally, I tossed it in a trash can. Worst mo money spent on Amazon so far."
I love being able to sync with multiple devices
Works great!
"Rubbish! Lenses are blurry, they don't fit right, cheap garbage... arg!"
These thing break within a month of usage.
Works fine
"Protector only seals to the watch around the center of the watch face and leaves raised areas around the edges. JETech sent me an email offering 100% satisfaction (&#34;For any reason&#34;) and then replied with an offer of a 50% refund when I replied with a return request. I'm no mathematician, but something doesn't add up here. This product made my watch look completely cheap and took away the sleek look and lines that Apple intended. See photos in other reviews."
Great Phone definitely worth the price and a nice screen size
really protects your phone and comfortable
it's really nice!
Good product
Can't be beat for the price
The best choice to have
Purchased this for my son an he loves it use his kick stand while watching movies an clips to his hip when we're out perfect for a nine year old or adult
"In case you do not know, the entire case is not SOLID plastic. This is a GOOD thing. It is hard plastic on the corners and sides. It is not plastic (and is some sort of rubber material) on the places where normal hard plastic cases break. It makes the phone look &#34;rugged&#34;. The kick stand works fantastically."
"Bought this wallet for my fiance,  she loves it!"
Burnt
"I LIVE WAY OUT IN A METAL CLAD HOME. SINCE ADDING THE SIGNAL BOOSTER TO MY HOME AND ONE FOR MY CAR, I JUST DON'T DROP CALLS"
Fits my phone perfectly and I've been getting a lot of compliments.
Love it. Great fit
Works great on my iPhone 6!
"I bought this and it doesn't even turn on.  5 solid blue lights when it's plugged into the charger, but NOTHING.  I can't even charge a cell phone with it, let alone start a car!!!"
Keeping my screen safe as I write i this review. Solid and smooth surface
I love it and very happy with my product that I got
Great price and worked well in the ocean surfing!
"[[ASIN:B00QTE09SY iClever® 4.8A 24W Dual USB Travel Wall Charger with SmartID Technology, Foldable Plug for iPhone iPad, Samsung Galaxy, HTC Nexus Moto Blackberry, Bluetooth Speaker Headset, Power Bank and More, White]]  Great product that solves a simple problem and ends the race between my wife and I for the charger outlet.  No worry that we have different devices and this thing knows what you need and handles the job.  Quality seems excellent."
"I go to gym on a daily basis and it's my habit to hear songs when I exercise. These earbuds are just perfect. These are sweat-proof and stays comfortably in the ear. The sound quality is too good and with hours of listening, my ears still comfortable. Love these! I am lucky to have them as a sample."
Perfect
Product was exactly what I wanted for a fraction of price that Verizon charges!
Worked out perfectly
"It does what it is supposed to. Reviews on many similar products had me wary, but this product turned out to be the right choice. This product does automatically connect to your phone."
"This is just perfect for perfect for my garage. Sounds great,couldn't be more pleased."
I like it a lot
It works as advertising.
Love it like that I can wear it as a purse and wristlet fits everything and I like with everything u still have room to use the coin zipper pocket
"This is a little more expensive than other tempered glass screens, but I think it's worth the extra couple dollars. I dropped this from around head height screen side onto a giant ass rock. There was a tiny tiny crack at the impact site. Dropping a phone onto a single point on a hard rock is probably some of the hardest force your phone can experience, assuming you're not throwing it at s***, and this screen protector took it like a champ. I would recommend this 100%."
worked
"The reading light arrived even sooner than expected, and works just fine. I had read a review that said it was too bright, but I didn't find that at all.  It even has two settings, both of which provide enough light.  I'm a little concerned that the expense of batteries will be a problem, but we'll have to see.  The light is on a wand that can be bent to any angle, so that is very good."
Yes. Thank you.
"Bought an iPad and saved $100 by getting the WiFi only model.  Only to realize there is no GPS on these.  So, bought this for GPS routing.  Works great and works great in an airplane as well.  Sit it near the window and your tracking your plane.  Standalone, you can use it to plot a route on a Polaris or other ATV.  I download the route and then overlay it on to a map."
Love it! Good quality and same As advertised! Happy with the product and it arrived right on time as estimated
Great product with nice features.  Looks 100% like original radio  in my dad's 66 novel with some updated technology.
I received everything as advertised.  Great deal!!!
It was very hard to put on
Good!
Works well just need to get use to
"Beautiful, powerfull and everything in nicely designed box. This is the best looking power bank I had. Express shipping. I can recommend it to anyone who's got bigger smartphone. I'm using Nexus 6 and it can be charged almost 5 times. My personal hero ;)"
not good. Use original one..
"The Anker PowerCore 15600 is most definitely the best portable charger currently on the market. It is about the size of a stack of 2 iPhone 6+. It is quite light considering it's massive charging capacity. It has a smooth and flawless exterior, making it a very attractive product. The external battery comes in very simple packaging, and it comes with a Micro USB charging cable and travel pouch, both of which are extremely useful. The battery charges all of my devices as quickly or faster than charging from an electrical outlet. With two USB outlets, I am able to charge my iPhone and wireless earbuds simultaneously, efficiently, and conveniently on-the-go. Once I plug my devices into the PowerCore via USB cables, I don't have to worry if the devices are charging because the PowerCore recognizes that the devices are plugged and starts charging them automatically without me having to do anything. With other external batteries I have tried, such as New Trent's, I would sometimes forget to press the power button after plugging my devices in, resulting in my devices not charging while I assumed that they were. I am completely worry-free about charging my devices when using my Anker PowerCore 15600, in part because of the automatic charging, but also because of Anker's MultiProtect safety system which ensures my devices will never adversely be affected by the output of the external battery. I could not be more pleased with this product.<br /><br />I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest."
"These are by no means a high quality speaker, but they do serve the purpose and as usual you get what you pay for."
The phone works OK but the microphone is terrible.  Anyone I talk with can't understand me until I go to speaker phone.  At that point it's real clear.  I would have sent it back but needed the phone for an up coming trip.  Will definitely be replacing it with another phone soon after the trip (which unfortunately is beyond my return date).
"Very solid charger, not a touch and go product like a lot of them out there.  Received an excellent discount for an honest review.  Thank you!"
"Excellent protection for the Samsung Galaxy S4.  It is soft, pliable, and easy to install."
"I brought this phone in June and since I have had so many problems with I! It used a Samsung phone in the past years and I never had problems with it. But this phone is just catastrophic!!!! The follwong problems;<br />It sometimes charge properly and sometimes I leave it hours on the charger and it does not charge fully,<br />_sometiomes the battery runs out very quick (sometimes not!!)<br />Sometimes I can make phone calls sometimes not; for example, when I call a  number which I all the time, sometimes I am able to call and ost of the time it tells me &#34;not registered on the network&#34;!!!!<br />When I send sms' s or messages on whatsup or viber, sometimes they go on time and I receive messages on time, but sometimes it takes hours until I receive a message that was sent hours ago or vice versa.<br /><br />Those are just some of the problems I can recall now. I went couple of times to my phone carrier and they replaced the chip card assuming  it might be from them, but the same problems continued over and over again.<br />Don't buy this phone!! It cames with a looooot of problems!!!"
"Terrific watch band, I got this because it matches well with my watch that I normally wear. The band is comfortable and without a doubt quality, I don't see it wearing or tearing anytime soon. The leather is thick and fits well around my wrist. The locking mechanism of the connector to the Apple watch is sturdy and secured."
Battery life not as expected. everything else is great.
Phone works great
"Hands down, the best earbuds you can get for under $100."
Haven't had any problems with it! Works just as well as the Apple charger. I like the convenient 3 pack and the feel of the wire--not sticky. :-)
just plastic .....dont buy it
Used it very much.
"I saw the previous reviews and was very excited to use this product. When I was trying to do a rough fit on my phone was confused because this screen protector was simply not fitting on my M9. A quick look at the box solved this problem. &#34;Compatible with Amazon Fire Phone&#34;. No problem, just let amazon know they gave me the wrong product, with comments that the box was for an &#34;Amazon Fire Phone&#34;. Couple days later, same issue. Does no one look at comments? Don't waste your time with Volt."
Works as advertised.
Great product
It wasnt the same color in the picture it's more green if any thing.
Easy to hook up.  Works great.  This should be included with the xm plug n play.  Don't know why I waited so long to get this.  I had pretty much given up on getting a good signal without static and fade out.  I am enjoying XM radio again.
I was a bit surprised when the first one stopped working but then I got a replacement in just a few days and it's awesome
"I was looking for a screen protector with some aesthetic appeal and that would cover edge-edge. This was easy to apply and looks good, especially on my black phone. However, between 1 - 2 weeks after application, the top left corner cracked without any obvious insult to the phone (I just had it in my pocket). I like the idea of tempered glass screen protectors and oleophobic coating (it was easier to keep clean than the iPhone screen itself), but it has to survive without serious breakage for at least a few months..."
These are the best headphones I have ever owned!  I cant' rave enough about how lightweight and durable they are.  I did a lot of research and found that this was the best deal and offered the most comfort.  I had to have a noise cancelling wireless headphones for what I planned to use these for.  This product delivered way far above what was expected.  I would easily purchase another pair without hesitation.
This thing charges my iPad and iPhones FAST!  Great charger...1
"[[VIDEOID:b1307f68c35bdad477763bb69225e146]] The TechMatte Power Pod 2 Qi wireless charger is a great \\""disc style\\"" Qi charger.  It is a little larger than other ones I have tested.  (This is a good this as it makes laying your phone down on it easier).  The charger comes with a standard USB to Micro USB cable that you can plug into any USB port on your computer or laptop.  They do not include a wall adapter with this, but I have several and used one of my own with no issues.  Nice user guide is provided all though not really needed because it is basically plug in and use.  I tested this unit with a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (with a Qi receiver installed), and had no problems with the Note 4 detecting the pad and charging (it does take a few seconds to detect the pad).  The build quality is nice, it is all plastic but I found no seams out of place and is put together nicely. Over all this is a great charger for TechMatte at a good price and I give it a thumbs up.  I was provided a unit at a reduced cost for my honest and unbiased review, I was not compensated to give a positive review my thoughts on the product are my own.<br /><br />Luke @ Galaxy Tech Review"
Love this case. I kept breaking my commander plastic clip so after the 4th clip I got this one. So glad I found it. I love how it keeps it nice and secure and has a magnet clip keeps it shut. The material is nice and thick. I have had a stray string come loose but nothing major.
Not to size. Doesn't cut easily.
Love the design. I'm hard on my phone and case fell apart.
Works great.  This product reduced the number of outlets my daughter needed to use in her college dorm.
"Very little to like or dislike referring to the product. I have used this phone for about two years and find it fine for my needs. However when I ordered it came from shopcelldeals and when the package arrived it was EMPTY!!! It took a good deal of writing, calling, arguing, cussing and waiting to get the product. I had a charge on my credit with an empty package. I finally was able to get in touch with shopcelldeals and they were able to give me the pin number for what I needed."
It was supposed to protect the phone. But after  a couple weeks the case broke.  No really strong.
Like it very well.
"Just as described, no defects whatsoever! Will buy from you again!"
I thought I had reviewed this already but I must have failed to press submit. In any event this is a great product. If I can apply this correctly anyone can. I watched the instructional video first. Then I followed the instructions to the letter. The only change I made is that I applied so much of the solution the shield was more than dripping. Once I positioned the screen I waited about 40 minutes for the sides to become sticky. I had to do this because I had overdone the solution. Then I patiently smoothed down the sides. I was very surprised at how good it looked and covered the COMPLETE screen. Then I went for a bicycle ride. I know I was supposed to wait overnight but what the hey? No lift...no problems. After the ride I let the watch dry overnight and the last couple of bubbles dissipated. GREAT product!
"Great product, shipping was really fast"
Very Sturdy.
Good
Outstanding case<br />All leather<br />Only problem is belt loop<br />I had to carry to shoe shop to get more dependable belt loop
Excellent
"Works decently well, my moto 360 has issues charging on it sometimes but it gets the job done."
I recently bought this case without reading that Otterbox does not make an Armor series case for the iPhone 5c. So I gave it to my mom and I've finally switched to the LifeProof brand which is a little more expensive but the same quality and less weight. LifeProof also comes in the color white.
Perfect
Great quality!
"Not what I expected, waste of money"
very pleased with my purchase .Was exactly what I was looking for.
Love the look of the case but it's way to big for my iphone 4! It looks like it should fit an iphone 6! Definitely returning! (I put my iphone 4 case beside the one I received definitely not the right case!)
lousy product breaks easily and cost just as much to get a replacement.  Not worth it.
Love this case!
I'm really bummed about this adapter. I was so exited to get it after reading all the good reviews. I've only been using it for 2 weeks and it's already giving out on me. I've had others that have lasted well over 6 months so am a bit disappointed. Wouldn't recommend this unless mine was just a dud. Maybe that's the case?
great!
"This case was definitely worth the gamble. I bought it hoping it would fit my Droid Turbo Ballistic & it does perfectly. I'm probably going to buy multiple in different colors. This case is slim & not bulky & I'm in love with the texture of it. It's not quite plastic but almost like the nonslip grip. The only thing I did not like about this particular case is the color did not quite match up with the picture shown. I was going for a more seafoam green, but it's more of a mint or an aqua green. Other than that I can't complain."
Husband uses this as a back up amp.  He loves it
"Charges fast from the orange port for my Z3c.<br /><br />I bought it to use the top port to charge my GF's iphone, but I'm not sure if it's too much current.  I emailed the manufacturer and haven't heard a reply yet."
Everything was as promised.  Thanks!
These are my favorite earbuds. The sound quality is good. The earbuds fit nice and snugly and stay in place. They are even comfortable to wear while laying on my side in bed. The remote & mic make pause/play and answering calls very easy.
Nylon braid feels a little odd versus snotty wire but the cable appears to be well-made.
Excellent
Fast shipping and a great price.  This is a bargain if you re not into texting and constant phone use.  I have triple minutes phone so this gives me 1200 minutes .  Which is usually plenty for me.
"Awesome case I like it it makes the phone a little heavier but other than that is great. Looks good, protects the phone well, fits perfectly I do recommend"
no good
the ear piece is excellent
Great length. Came just as described.
Charges the phone very quickly in the car
"Works great for perk t.v, I have bought 5 of this phone and they only crash from time to time, and I have made 20$ in 2 weeks using them for this purpose, that's close to 50$ a month so they will pay for themselves in 2 months."
Really like these covers easy to put on.. Just make sure u get them on right the first time.. They don't do so well if u have to pull them up..but they work very well.
Well constructed cell phone mount with optional ways to use it. Fast delivery by the company. I love it.
Didn't work well. We had to return it.
"This was super easy to apply! I loved it!<br /><br />That being said, after a week of it going from my back pants pocket, to my purse (I keep it in its own pocket so nothing will scrape it), it has at least seven scratches and/or cracks. This glass is incredibly frail. I've never dropped my phone, and the screen protector I had before was plastic (the only reason I replaced it was because it started to curl at one corner). Honestly, I think I'd be better off putting it in an otter box case to keep it safe. I may order this again, or maybe a higher quality because I really adore my glitter waterfall case that's on my iphone. I'm just sad that it looks so beat up so quickly."
Perfect case!
Love and keeping it
Inexpensive but functional
"excellent case, great price"
Fast shippingz. Comes in a premium box. Looks like it'll last.
I bought two of these and couldn't be happier. I plug my phone in and drive 30 minutes to work and it can charge my battery from 10% to nearly 60-70% very rapid charging!
The best purchase ever made online. I would definitely recommend the seller to others.
I love my new case! It's perfect! Love the Pink!!!
Great Bluetooth works good
"The armband is soft and comfortable when worn. The Galaxy Note 5 fits even with the case I have on my phone. The screen is responsive with the plastic cover. I would not recomend using the key holder if the key does not completely slip into the slot, otherwise the key may fall out during your walk or run. Also the openings for the bottom of the phone are not place correctly. The headphone  jack is covered. You can probably put a head set if you stretch the material where the hole is at. If you only use bluetooth headphones then this should not be an issue. Overall, it does the job of holding my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 while I run."
l love it
"Well fitting secure cover.  Fits nice and tight on turbo fiber finish phone. Good solid color and feel, highly recommend after reading about various brands.  The shipping was really quick, glad I ordered this, well worth it."
*NOTE*<br />some of these WILL fit the surface pro 3 kickstand to attach the hinge.<br /><br />Thanks!
"The sound is good, a little muffled for my taste but good enough for training. However, for me personally I found them painful to put on more than an hour. Thus, I took one star out.<br /><br />Other than that the battery life is as described, switching between devices is a breeze, very light you can hardly feel them while training."
Does not hold gps or cell phone and cell phone is a motorola turbo pretty thick phone.
Offers good protection. Not waterproof but very sturdy and long-lasting.
"This is a replacement to an old Belkin 2 usb port charger I had used for years! This is better in that it has 1 quickcharge port kind of to future proof for newer phones that support it and 1 additional port to charge whatever else. Right now I use this to travel, it charges my Nexus 5, Ipad, & Moto 360, so only 1 charger with 3 cables much lighter and organized. Only downside is that it's a bit heavy so it might come loose in the outlet. So just make sure to give enough slack on the cable as to not put additional weight that might pull it out from the outlet."
It works.
"A life saver on our vacation.  With phones and cameras and all, it would have been a logistical nightmare .. .or we'd have had to take multiple chargers.  I might even consider one with four ports for the next trip.  The only downside was that my wife does not like the blue light on when she sleeps.  I threw a shirt over it and ... problem solved ;-)"
By far the best screen protector I've ever used. Very easy to install. No bubbles. All 4 corners are secure. No issues whatsoever.
Fits well and does what its supposed to
Functions very well as an iPhone 5 charger.
good deal and great product
Everything was great
This is an exact OEM part to update my 2014 Ford F-150 Nav. system. It has the most up-to-date information available from Ford at this time for the in-dash map.  Simple & easy to change out the old SD card & replace it with the new SD card at less than half the price of the dealer price.
"This is it. Stop looking I read all the reviews and bought about 10 diffrent kind. When I clicked yes I accidentally hit the wrong size. The seller corrected my mistake no problem! These are perfect allot of the rubber cases attract hair and dust, these have a great finish. Allot of watch cases don't fit the buttons the right way or block the crown, these line up perfectly. Bonus is the charger cable holder! This deal is amazing!"
"I can't say much because they're not installed in my car. nonetheless, they look really great and I've tested them using my home theater system. they sound great and I think I'll buy another subwoofer from them soon. the one thing that kind of disappointed me was that it did not come with speaker wires or wire clips. what you see is what you get. 9/10. would highly recommend for budget and decent sound quality.<br /><br />UPDATE: The speakers work beautifully in my 2012 VW GTI. I'm very impressed by the sound and quality of these subs. I also bought a pair of spacers to tag onto the speakers."
Excellent
Amazing
"it broke so easily, on my first week the glass cracked  across<br />with my first phone drop"
"2 amp output has been helpful for charging USB battery packs while hiking in remote areas. It draws power even on slightly cloudy days, but you should charge a battery pack, not an iPhone directly. The iPhone will cut out as soon as the tiniest cloud crosses in front of the sun, and it will not resume charging until it is unplugged and reconnected. Charging directly to USB battery pack (Anker E5) resumes as soon as the sunlight returns without having to reconnect the wire."
I love it went to the beach and swim under water with it recorded video
Great case.  Great price
"I will never buy anything else again, these are phenomenal, Im hoping they make these for my tablet!"
Excellent
Great USB hub.  Charges all of my tablets at once....and quickly!
I used the screen for 4 months and it's great. The only thing sometimes the left bottom corner doesn't respond properly.<br />I broke my phone again so I will order another one again.
Product is okay.<br />Amazon.com service ¡VERY BAD!
"A little bulky, but good value."
Super
Very nice i iwll buy it again.
"I am happy with it. You get what you pay for. It does the job, is small enough for travel. I had to Send my original back after almost one year, it just stopped charging. Verizon honored the warranty without any hassle and got a brand new one. I also own a Galaxy Note, works just as good for MY needs. I use both of them."
This works great for my phone and hubby's!  Wish I had bought more!
works well
Great fit and comfortable
This product appliEd without a problem and looks great
"I was hesitant to buy a new phone battery from Amazon after hearing how many people were disappointed with their purchases.  This thing works great so far, though - my old battery was dying halfway through the day with almost no usage, and now it's still at 40-60% at the end of the day.  I've had it for a week and so far so good.<br /><br />I have the S5 active, which I think it says not to use with this battery because the back cover doesn't seal as tightly as it should with this slightly thicker battery.  I couldn't notice a difference, it still seems to click into place all the way around, but I'm definitely not going to dunk it on purpose so I couldn't really say whether this compromises the waterproofing."
"On the positive:  light weight, comfortable, loads GPS quickly and accurate, battery life as advertised; easy to add aps; syncs well with iPhone.  On the negative:  the screen is dark, so far unable to control the lap times, cannot toggle to watch mode while also in running mode.  Still learning."
"Feels incredibly durable, I got this to keep my phone protected and well I am very certain that no harm will ever happen with it in this case. The only problem I have is the latch that covers the headphone port it's a little inconvenient when you have headphones in while it's in your pocket. But honestly you can take it off so I don't really care. Great case very satisfied."
The case is actually to big for the LG G4 phone.
LOVE IT!
It doesn't charge as the original is a cheap one
"Great and excellent product, protect excellent the iPhone Screen."
Does the job the bass knob works. I am driving one sub so just buy an amp that's overrated for your sub and you'll be good
good
"Edit: 21-DEC-15 They thanked me for changing the review to four stars and then retracted the offer to the free stainless version. This time I'll be keeping the one star rating until I receive a product that does not rust. It was advertised as water sports. Kevin and Marty, No need to email me again and waste my time.   Edit: 20-DEC-15 I am editing my review to receive the new stainless version. This one should not rust. Hopefully.  Original: Used once on a one day boat trip. Rinsed with all my other gear and towel dried/ air dried. This is the only thing that rusted. Contacted their customer support and didn't hear anything back."
My 7 year old loves them and can use them with no problems. No more Tangles here.
Great quality.  Very solid construction and a rubberized texture.  The volume is loud enough to use on conference calls etc.  The battery life is great also; about three days if I leave it on accidentally.  I almost dropped $100 on a Jawbone but glad I took a chance on this one.  I don't know if the Jawbone is louder etc. but this performs to the level I need it so I am happy.
Love love love love this case. I truly think this is the best case ever. Highly recommend
Camera hole is too small and the volume buttons were off.
nice
Love the case feels great looks great pretty pink color takes drops well
"Great case, easy to put on and take off. Nice that is flat so level app is quite accurate. It is nice having the clear back so you can see the phone itself"
Seriously the best glass screen protector out there. I highly recommend it and would choose this every time. Their cases are great as well.
Great adapter.
"[[VIDEOID:5698b5f7fbc30e7ecc9a7aee3ccda268]] We were not sure what to expect when received this product for review.  We have tested a few waterproof cases and pushes so we were ready to take this on a trip to Mexico for the beach and pool. The case did not disappoint . As we show in the video, you are able to actually submerge the case and whatever is inside without water damage.  We were able to fit a Galaxy 6 in a normal case (non Otterbox type) easily with some credit cards, ID and cash.  Using the strap for my arm was not needed, but tests with it were successful. Most people will either hand carry it or use the lanyard I imagine.  The lanyard worked fine and was long enough to wrap around my neck for the walk.<br /><br />One benefit I didn't see another review discuss, which we show in the video, is your ability to actually interact with the touchscreen on your phone while it is in the Wizen bag.  I demo how we were able to unlock, open the camera, move screens around and more.  This is a great added benefit of being able to not only protect it but use the camera.  The back of the bag has the built in slot where you should place the camera area so we knew there had to e a reason.<br /><br />The locks on the top of the box are sturdy but if you break one of those then the case pretty much becomes useless since it holds the seal. Make sure to take care of those when opening and closing the bag up.<br /><br />Overall we are happy and impressed with this and it goes on our travels that involve the pool and water now."
Is easy to broke
"My new phone has a sealed battery.  Before, I would carry a few spare batteries with me throughout the day so I could keep using the phone all day long.  I decided to invest in a portable battery charger and since I've had good success with Anker products, I decided to give the Astro E1 a shot.<br /><br />The E1 charges faster than I expected, taking my phone from 30% to 90% in about 30 minutes.  Plus, it does have enough power to charge a couple of times before needing to be recharged.  On the downside, it is a little heavier and larger than anticipated.  Still, give me something a little bigger and heavier that works great than something that's too small and can't get the job done.<br /><br />This is a must purchase for any iPhone & Galaxy S6 user to prevent being chained to an outlet."
Wrong size and it'll cost more to send it back then it did to buy it. I'm gunna sell it on ebay. Lol
"Excellent product.  Attached easily, fit perfectly, works better than the phone surface itself.  Excellent addition to a great phone (Samsung S4)."
Be aware that if you do not use the device for 60 days your data expires... what i thought it never expired.... not true you have to use the device and your data otherwise it expires.... generally slow connection and had to make regular calls to customer service to keep it working. i am currently test driving Karma to see if it is a  real alternative.
Works very well and easy to install.
"I just got the Edge phone a week ago and was adament on having a case to protect it.  I purchased this one and while it would fit width wise, there is no way humanly possible that this will fit length wise!!!  It is about a half inch to inch too short for the phone!  TOTAL waste of time and money"
Very impressed with this case. It was exactly what I wanted without any of the added bulk other cases seem to have. It went on easy and fits the phone snug. It was exactly what I wanted!
OE and works as intended.
Arrived on time with Sunday Prime.  The installation was as easy as any other iPhone model using YouTube examples for the tricks (the cables are lightly glued in three places and the prox sensor filter needs to be transferred on black phones...very helpful tips).  It's working great so far.
Would not hold the phone firmly in the case. Allowed it to come out breaking the screen. Had to purchase a new phone.
"Application was flawless, however the edges chipped and left a shard of glass in my thumb. Would not recommend to anyone."
Do not buy. These head phones broke after 3 days after i bought them.
Good!
Great product thanks very well build quality
"Awesome window control for any Viper alarm.  You don't need to have a DEI branded alarm to utilize it, but I believe most of the alarms sold in the US is probably from them.<br /><br />The installation was easy, assuming you know exactly what to do, and what each wire function does.  I purchased 2 of these to control 4 windows in my Infiniti I30.<br /><br />The only negative thing about this unit is the programming of the window venting.  I needed to vent the front windows more than normal to get them to vent the right amount.  When I initially programmed both units, the front windows barely vented, but the rear windows vented perfectly.  I initially thought there was a problem with the front windows (not venting at all).  Luckily the programming of the windows is not difficult at all.<br /><br />Last alarm I installed was a Clifford Avantgard 5, with the Smart Windows.  To program the venting, you use a laptop with Cliffnet Wizard.<br /><br />*****Update March 30, 2016*****<br />I am providing an update.  I have been using this alarm system (5704) and two of these window control units.  At times, when trying to vent the windows, one or more of these units will fail to vent the windows.  Once, it only vented one of 2 windows that it's connected to.  I am unsure what is going on, but my connections are solid."
"I've had this for a while now and I'm very happy with my perchace, I had looked into many different power banks but I know I needed it to be very big, I decided to get this one and have been very surprised with the size, I'll charge my iPod and phone and many friends and families devices including iPads and other tablets and it felt like I had to try to kill the battery! It is large, that wasn't a problem for me because I just wanted a lot of power but it could be a problem. The only other concern is there's been 2 times (out of probably 30 or 40) times when I plugged it in and I wasnt able to get it to start charging, id try again later and it worked fine but it may be a concern but I'm very glad I perchaced this and if your looking for a big power bank id recomend it!!"
It was just what I wanted they fit perfectly the quality also was great
Great price & great charger...
👍🏻
case does not fit well
I only gave it four stars because I got it for a friend he said it was great he tried two other batteries from some were else one lasted a week and the other started to expand in a day or two and these one has been going strong for six weeks and no problems so far great battery
Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Nicely made.
Perfect fit. Love it.
Remember Matthew 7:21
Nice small car charger. Charges pretty fast. not much more to say about it. it is what it is.
"I never do reviews  &#34; never &#34; but I just dropped my phone in Starbucks parking lot came out and noticed my phone on ground , tire marks on case!!! I am using my phone to write review !!! Don't no how it made it honestly but it did"
"I do photo And video with this phone inside of the water<br />It does not shoot clearly ( clear shots , or maybe it was the quality / color of nyc beach ) underneath the water but ask for it being<br />waterproof and being able to be in the water with it it is amazing!! I am so pleasantly pleased after skeptism.... worth every penny.... I got good photography"
Feels comfortable in my hand which is always a plus
Selfie stick is an AWESOME product. Highly recommended
"bad quality,cannot cover the screen,easily dirty."
Love it
"Terrible, cannot hold charge.  After a full night of charging, my phone was at the same charge (no apps running, on wifi).  Do not recommend at all, look at the Encased USB wall charger instead."
Number 1
Best thing ever
Sent it bsck
This is my first portable charger. So far it's good.<br />Bought since the Anker products are great.
"Beautiful cases with vibrant colors and a textured feel.  They are definitely for look, though, and not protection."
"Awesome cables, great price"
LG protective case works as advertised.
This could never be found via Bluetooth
Last for over a year
fits almost ant were like it
Works great
"I don't normally leave feedback, but this deserves one. I LOVE my case. Those color it's so pretty, the ridges on the back provide a nice grip, cut outs are precise, not cheap feeling, provides great protection. I've dropped my phone twice and it's in tip top shape!"
Charges fast.  Minimal heating.
amazing. fits perfect
Received and good
"Amazing, at first I was a bit skeptical about this case seeing as I would use it with my iPhone 5s but I have no regrets. It worked perfectly, I followed the instructions on the manual and tested it with a piece of paper (it was a success) after the initial test I decided it was trust worthy enough to place my phone inside. It worked just fine in the pool.<br /><br />I'm some of the reviews I noticed that lots of people had a problem with the cable thing that allows you to place it around your neck. Simple solution to that, just use a key chain instead of the flimsy part on the neck tie (tie the key chain to the main part of the neck tie and not to the detachable part) this will stop it from breaking and even if it does break the keychain will hold it up.<br /><br />Highly recommended product!"
"Plastic is very cheap on thin. The rubber outside comes off very easily and isn't tight. I definitely think that if I dropped it, the iPad wouldn't be protected. The kickstand works, but it's hard to pull it out. I don't know how many times you use it before it breaks off. To use it, you pull it out and 2 tiny metal rods hold it in the guide. Spend the more money and buy some protection. I don't recommend this to anyone, I just brought it to see if it was a diamond in the rough. But it's not."
Upscale quality.  Excellent value.  No worries on this purchase!!
"The IPhone is great with some wear in the backside, but working as new"
"I used this glass screen protector to protect my new LG G3.  So far, it has kept my screen scratch, dust, and crack free.  Admittedly, I haven't dropped my phone, but I've heard the glass screen protectors act as a sacrificial screen should it drop and it will crack before your screen does.<br /><br />I paired this protector with a slim case and together, they look stock on the phone but I feel protected.

"I make and sell greeting cards to benefit our local library, and this Cottage Cutz two-piece mini frog die looks cute on my favorite anniversary card.  It would also work well on children's birthday cards.<br /><br />I used 80 lb. card stock to cut this die on my Sizzix Grand Calibur machine,<br /><br />Please see customer image for an example of an A7 (5&#34; x 7&#34;) anniversary card that I made with this die.  The castle die is made by Quick Kutz and the cat tails are cut from another Cottage Cutz die, &#34;Mallard Ducks w/ Cats-tail.&#34;"
Very nice case - exceptional value
I love this cable. It's exactly what I needed for my desk at work!
Functions as advertised.
broke a couple weeks after installing.
Works just fine. Well made. Great value.
The best budget lightning cable. No era message.  I orderd 4 more😊
Piece of crap! Mine never worked.  What a waste of money. I followed the direction and it never worked at all.
"The band was OK, but way to large for my small wrist so I had to return. A description of sizing would have been helpful. If you have a small wrist, I doubt this will work for you."
"I like the concept, to have a full cover and a small space for your money and a few cards.  This only took a few days to arrive.  I was a little bit disappointed in the quality, it;s good, but not great...but for the price, it's not a bad deal."
"Serves its function well enough, doubles as a light weight wallet for my wife."
"I really was in need of a longer charger and this one seemed perfect. I absolutely love the length, for this price it seems like its worth it. But don't be fooled, the first couple days it was awesome and worked excellent. I started to notice that the lightning symbol in the top right hand corner was on meaning it was charging but the percentage was going down while i was using my phone. I figured i maybe needed to put it down for a little and use one of my older chargers, however it would work on and off. Sometimes it charged while i was on my phone and sometimes it didn't, it was working fine when my phone was off. Then it got bad, my phone was on a low percentage the night before maybe like 20%. I plugged my phone in thinking it was charging. The next morning, I woke up late because my alarm hadn't gone off and my phone was dead. My phone had not been dead the night before so this seems strange to me. That day i tested the charger out on someone elses phone thinking its maybe a problem with my phone but the phone i tested it on had a percentage of 71 and i played on the phone for a few minutes and checked and saw the percentage was at 69. I turned off the phone and left it alone and it was now at 68%. Im so confused as to why the percentage is going down, i can see why it would go down while I'm playing on it because perhaps its just not charging. It was so strange to me that when i turned it off the percentage still went down. Maybe its just the charger i got or maybe its the brand... i don't really know what to do because my older charger is being funny as well. Did this charger ruin my phone battery?"
Holds the iPhone 6 plus perfectly.  It would work with many different cases too.  Worth every penny!
Didn't stick to my smooth plastic dash like advertised. Might stick to windshield but that's not why I bought it. Very dissatisfied.
I bought this case straight from Griffin and I love it and the camo color. I have had Griffin Survivor cases since the IPhone 4 and they just keep improving. No more camera flap on this case. The screen protector on this case is awesome too. It doesn't sacrifice typing like the Otterbein where there is a pocket of air in between the case and the protector so you have to press hard. No air pocket in this case. Just buy it yet u won't be disappointed!
I like this phone it is more that I was expecting .Amazing image resolution.
"Easy to apply, saved screen."
"So far they have been wonderful.  Over time it will be tested.  I walk normally everyday and use them, will try to repost after 6 month"
"I was happy to see this product available for review opportunity to give my unbiased opinion.<br /><br />I've seen these selfie sticks all over the place and the use has intrigued me.  This particular Maxpro stick is great.  It is so easy to use.  I thought I would have to have even the teeniest bit of tecno savvy, but no.  The handle is very good, no slip, hard rubber.  It has a telescope that allows you to extend the camera about three feet.  There is also a rubber holder that takes my iphone perfectly, but I think it holds any smart phone.  We've had a great time using it at a recent family gathering that we could easily shoot group shots and immediately post them; it looked like we had someone else taking the picture.  It was a kick for those who couldn't make it.  You can't tell that you were the one that just took that picture.  You can get creative with angles and get very interesting shots.  Of course, there is a button on the handle that allows you to take the shot.  I'm going to be using this at my office to make business quick videos.  It is great.  I couldn't be happier.  You can actually see a picture of yourself from a distance, just setup your camera to show reverse, in case you ever get lonely for yourself.  You probably want to charge it up before using for about 3 hours; I did."
Great
"I'm an elephant collector, I may be a bit biased but I love this case! I can keep my ID inside it, the phone fits perfectly!! I would love to get another one in a different color."
it wasn´t the original item
"These radios worked very well, the few times I needed them. Paired with a &#34;Secret Service&#34; earbud, they worked perfect for wedding videographers indoors. I never had a problem with range, because I didn't try to use them like they were a cell phone.<br /><br />I would buy these again."
"I sadly did not receive my package the first time, but I definitely do not blame that on the seller. They communicated with me just fine and I'm so glad that they sent it once more.<br />This is just as I expected. It's super lovely and just adorable.<br />My only complaints are that it's smaller than I expected and it also has many scratches on it.<br />They scratches are not that visible though, so everything is just fine!<br />5/5 Would buy again"
Works great!
Love this design!
Good protection on this case. Love the color combo!
"The case provides excellent shock protection for the enclosed phone. But it's nearly impossible to reopen the case without breaking off the latches in order to access the SIM. While prying to reopen the case, the phone was in danger of being scratched which defeats the whole purpose of using the protective case."
"Broken, better selfie sticks on the market."
"I have a lifeproof case for our iPad and I was excited to get one for my new phone. I water tested the unit as the instructions stated and it passed perfectly. I installed the case on my phone. I was disappointed when the Touch ID did not work, but I felt that was not a deal breaker. So I made my first call to see how the speaker and microphone worked. The speaker sounded slightly muffled, but not too bad. The microphone however was horrible. The called said I sounded like I was in a cave, very muffled, garbled and barely understandable. I was crushed. Guess I need to look for a new case..."
Very minimalist but very durable.
He picture was cool but the phone case looked nothing like the picture. It was screen printed on there and all stretched out like there was no effort involved putting it together. Don't waste your money.
Good cover and light weight. Better than the o box
"The product I Thought at first was petty good. It started with me getting a chip on the corner of the glass. I figured, I paid a premium for this just in case this happened.... Right?.... WRONG!. Contacted them via email. Was told to go through their website. Long story short, my Amazon order number was not recognized. Emailed again, was referred back to the website.... Same thing. Emailed again.... Nothing. 2 weeks later, still nothing. I contacted Amazon about this issue. Amazon gave me a full refund.... They stated they cannot make a merchant honor their warranties. If your outside of 30 days and your wanting your &#34;lifetime warranty&#34;. Good luck! 6% seem to get the same treatment. This should be illegal. Can't claim something to get the money, then totally ignore what YOU promised. Thank God for Amazon, otherwise I would have just been held up for 15 bucks! Plus the iAnder one works for privacy way better at shorter angles and a lot darker without having to darken the brightness on your screen."
The product arrived broken
"This niftyty little Pouch which secures with a snap closure provides everything I need, I wanted a hands-free means of carrying my phone when I'm walking my dog with the leash in one hand and various other items in my other hand  this certainly meets my requirements. It arrived quickly which is always appreciated, it has a separate little area for cash or credit cards and most importantly to me, an adjustable shoulder strap . a separate wrist strap was enclosed as well. Great gadget.  It's light weight I do have a mini droid and this case weighs a little less than the phone. There is more than enough room for my phone this would hold a larger phone Also"
"I am a serious opponent of texting or even chatting on the phone while driving, just TOO DANGEROUS! But I do use my phone for Google Maps, and being an older version human, I don't entirely trust that ethereal voice coming from the phone. I want to actually see where I am going next, and that involves looking away from the road and down at the phone. I bought this nifty gadget to rectifiy that issue and I love it. Again, being that older version human, I need to have the dang thing a bit closer than the windshield in order to read it. The A/C vent option is the perfect position. This product clips on to the horizontal vent slats and has a collapsing stabilizing leg that allows it to fit onto a multitude of surfaces. The phone grasps are very easy to operate and have both side and bottom lips which are sturdy and secure the device well. The platform is adjustable and once you find the angle right for you, it is secured tightly in place with a simple twisting lock mechanism. I also like that the bottom lip has ample space to allow the charger to be in place. I like that insertion and removal of the device are extremely easy, which allows you to remove it and store it out of sight when not in use. I did read one question regarding the possibility of obstruction of airflow from the A/C, and I do not agree that it has no effect. I live in Florida and it is now August and this is of keen interest to me. However, while I did find it obstructed the airflow quite a bit, I resolved that by moving it to the farthest position of the two vents. That took care of it, at least for the driver side, and once the car cools off, I doubt it would matter much anyway. All in all, I think it was one of the best purchases I made recently on Amazon."
Broke within two days and got stuck in my phone
Brushed metal part of case began pulling away from the rubber part of the case 2 days after it was put on my phone. Not worth the money.
Ot is good
The sound quality is amazing and the price is very low compared to the quality!
"Protects phone very well, looks great!"
"Phone keeps over heating and shutting off, even when not in use.  I know it was a refurbished phone but it obviously wasn't checked before sending out."
"This was just what I needed for a recent road trip. Everyone was able to charge their phone and the product worked well. Charged rapidly and didn't overheat. Liked the labeling on the product which shows the charge number for phone or tablet. Overall, I'm pleased with this product."
"I like the holder / mount, it is small, flexible and  doesn't take up much space and looks nice over the dashboard of the car. the problem is that I'm afraid that for the long term the sticky gel pad will wear off or collect dust, the other problem is that it can only hold the phone horizontally which means that I have to keep my screen rotation option on which uses more battery on my phone."
perfect for my s5
Good looking and easy to install.
Doesn't stay in place on the Fitbit Charge
"I have owned a Boostcase before and loved it until the case broke, I reordered the new one and it worked fine for about 2 weeks until it started to fry my batteries. I could charge batteries without Boostcase on,but the minute I put on Boostcase it would kill the battery. So not only out of the cost of the new Boostcase but the two new Samsung batteries I just bought. So not happy at all with the purchase at all seriously DEFECTIVE!!<br />HOPE TO HEAR FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SEE IF THEY BACK THERE PRODUCT - WILL LET YOU KNOW........"
I love this case.  The color is exactly what I expected.  It appears as if I purchased a new phone. The grip is nice and it provides protection for my phone.
The case is cheap very cheap
It's great if you tend to drop your phone alot like me. It's very durable and it does glow in the dark somewhat.
"These guys work great! Beware of the GSM restrictions, though. It's in the manual, but no one reads it. Using certain channels and powers will get you in trouble with the FCC without a license! These are perfect and compact for our work events we had during August. Our buildings proved a little much with interference, but considering we weren't the Secret Service, they got the job done alright."
The phone case came in bent on the side.<br />It never went back to the previous shape and it got dirty quickly.<br />I would not recommend this to anyone.
Great connections!
great
Works great...
love the case and it was perfect fit on my phone
Works just as good as the other higher priced cases
"really like the case, good protection without being too bulky"
Cheap Case Just A Sticker Printed On Nothing Like A Sole Very Upset Waited 3 Weeks For This Garbage
Loved it soo much I bought another one when my other one broke. Looks great with the gold iPhone. Lots of compliments
"Packaged great. These folks obviously sell these for a living. Good directions, pieces and parts included.<br /><br />If you are going to do this yourself, it's not a piece of cake but it's not space shuttle technology either.<br /><br />Here's an old wives tale. Once you set these protectors that's it. It better be right or you're sunk. That is BS.<br /><br />Keep the plastic backer that you removed from the sticky side. Place a piece of the backer across one corner of the phone face covering maybe a half inch of the corner. Set the protector. Should the protector fail to land squarely on the phone or other issues signal a fail like dust on the surface creating pimples, use the backer to lift the protector away from the phone with a gentle and even pull until enough is free that you can handle the protector with your fingers on the edges only. Realign and retry or, if the protector gets a dust particle stuck to the sticky side use the sticky tape that came with the protector for dabbing on the prone face to do the dabbing to the dust particle. Hey, what is the worst that can happen? You were going to junk it and buy another anyway so if these hints help it's a win win, if not no big deal.<br /><br />For the faint of heart, take your phone and this protector to your mobile providers storefront and they will do it for you."
Good
"These speakers are tremendous sounding in my Chevy sonic. Built an enclosure just slightly bigger than what they spec out at and... Wow. They hit harder than the 12&#34; subs that I had before. The amp is good. Probably a bit to powerful for these subs but it can be turned down. This amp gets hot! It needs to be in a well ventated area and probably should have some sort of fan on it. Otherwise, awesome"
Malfunctioned after 2 uses
This phone mount is clean and looks like it belongs in the car. Not some ugly piece of plastic that serve no purpose. My only complaint is the suction cup. The mount tends to fall from the windshield often. This is can be frustrating when you're using your GPS
Perfect
Grest product. Thanks!
"QUALITY: tested and it works DELIVERY: slow boat from China (expected): PRICE: low - minimal risk.<br />If you kept floppy discs and want to transfer to other media this unit has done the job. Looks like it will have limited life but if I get through my floppies, I will never need it (nor the floppies) again. Owning costs less than third party conversion for half a dozen floppies.<br />BARGAIN"
"Unlike some cases I've had in the past, it seems to not get dirty very easily and does not seem to trap a lot of unwanted dust. It is rather hard to get it on and off sometimes for cleaning."
I love the color! Very light and sleek. Not bulky like a lot of cases.
I love my Anker PowerCore mini.  I carry this in my purse or when I travel.  It holds it's charge for months and I use it when I travel and need to power up my phone.
Charges my phone almost all the way.
"Very cheap copy of the apple adapter.  Lasted less than a month.  When I got around to trying to return it, it was too late."
Did not work. Took a month to get refunded after returning it.
Love it 😍😍😍😍
Just want I needed for the head unit.
"Good product, but I had to throw mine and my husband's in the trash. I followed all the instrucions on the video exactly as it was told, but the corners and sides do not stick, I tried everything."
"I've never owned a selfie stick honestly, so this is the first one actually but I will say this much, the photobomb selfie stick is really convienant for me to use, there's no extra wires attached to get in the way. And the photobomb selfie stick completely supports my iphone when in place so in not worried about my phone falling and getting damaged because it's securely held into place using padding to so now scratches occur while placing it into the selfie stick. I totally love the photobomb selfie stick and will be using this everyday. I also highly reccomend purchasing one if you haven't already, not only is this a great item I got it for an unbeatable price with the exchange of a review and last but not least the shipping was super fast. Thanks"
It fits very comfortable and I wear it for 8 hours a day and it does not bug me
Don't like it.
"Rugged case and comfortable to hold. For the price, you may not find anything better. Its well put together and feels sturdy."
"Initially, this would have received a 5 star rating.  But, as it no longer functions (after ~1 year or light use), I recommend it with warning.<br />This was plugged in permanently on my desk at work, removed only during occasional work-travel.  This week it stopped working as a wireless charger; does not power on.  The battery does still charge and discharge though, so it's not a total loss."
Quick service excellent product
Great charger.  I easily get 3+ charges on a Samsung Galaxy 3.  Works perfectly for camping trips or long days on the boat.
poor quality
Fits perfect and super cute!
Not what I expected at all.  Online description misleading.  Gave it away for my son to play with  don't waste your money
Love this case... fast service...
"Shopping experience: excellent, products arrived quickly, at expected times.<br /><br />Product: Plantronics M60 is good, works fine, and is perfectly adequate for non-noisy environments.  Sound quality is not as good as 5 other corded ear sets I've tried in noisy environments (e.g., in my car).  For example, Jabra EarWave Corded is superior.  However, note that all corded ear sets I've tried (including Plantronics M60) give superior sound quality to any of the 5-6 Bluetooth (non-corded) ear sets I've tried."
"I like this phone. My wife, my mom, and I each have one and they suit our needs."
"So far so good! Just received it, super fast shipping, and quality packaging. Currently testing it out with my 1st gen ipad mini and so far so good!"
"This is super cute, but the tail falls off. We attached a large cardboard to the inner side so it wouldn't slip out as easily."
Excellent quality case.  Exactly what I was looking for...a clear case to protect entire phone from scratches but without adding to the size of the phone.  Just make sure you put the case on perfect because any areas that do not completely adhere to the phone will cause problems once dirt gets under it.  Would definitely buy again!
"Look real good , works as advertised , happy"
It didn't fit the prevail as I bought it for my daughters boost mobile prevail.  She was soooo disappointed.
Perfect!
Worst phone ive ever bought.straight out of the box the headphone jack never worked. after a few months of owning it the cheap battery's life span is less than half as good as it was out of the box. I ordered the wrong version with our knowing so it always has connectivity issues on tmobiles prepaid network and always drops calls and texts never gets through. Now when i barely touch the screen the picture on the screen warps and discolors out of nowhere!!!! If your looking for a cheap phone thats really good try the asus zenphone and avoid this terrible unsupportivte company at all costs.
Phone was delivered  on July 17th and worked fine and the phone screen started going black 08-30-15 and is continuing to go black and the last day to return the phone was 08-17-15 so now I'm stuck with it.
It does not stick to your car.
best holder I have ever owned.
"I followed the directions precisely. Cleaned the case with the alcohol pad provided and let it dry thoroughly. Peeled the liner from the adhesive and pressed the adapter to the case and held it with constant pressure for 30 seconds, flipped it over and held it for another 30 seconds, then let it dry for more than 24 hours before using. Then the first time I used the belt clip the adhesive let loose and my phone went clattering to the floor. I called lifeproof and they are going to send me a replacement adapter. If the first adhesive didn't hold then why should I trust the replacement?"
love it!! nice & durable to protect my phone without being too bulky.
"The headset has the most awesome sound and, it takes 10- 15 to charge it for 5 hours. Comfortable to wear, sound is great. I love it. Well worth the amount I paid."
"Phone case was ok, plastic is not very strong. The clip holder assembly was completely worthless, the phone would get stuck inside the holder and not come out. I will not buy this product."
"So let me start off by saying these Bluetooth headphones are amazing. I have been using them for a couple of days now and they meet all my expectations. I can barley tell there even there and they are very comfortable. My big thing is that I needed a headphone set that would not fall out my ears and this fit perfect. The sound quality is amazing, it hits the lows, highs, and mids all really well. The only reason I did not give five stars is because sometimes the music cuts out it is not very often though so I can't complain. Overall great product!!"
"Is what it is. Does what it is supposed to do. Like it says, doesn't include hardware but I didn't need it in this case."
"Very,very,happy,a love,this wallet for my z30 blackberry."
It didn't work
sound quality was not up to par in addition to radio and USB functionality were faulty at best. back up camera and navigation we okay.
As advertised. Fast shipping. Slim case with good protection. Clear color is sophisticated looking.
Great cord.
Works great
This was cute but I returned it because it was not what I thought it was. The item was okay with no problems but I cannot say more than that because I did not use it.
"It crack less than two days, it fit so tight it was very hard to take off."
"I bought this case for my niece. She loves it. It fits good and looks cute too. It is what it says it would be, a hard case.With a great price!"
"1) My Galaxy S4 does NOT fit the product.  My phone is too small, and falls out.  This seems like it was designed for an S5 to be honest.  So either I got the wrong model, or this thing is poorly designed.<br /><br />2) The way the main holder connects to the mount makes it wiggle and shake when pressing the touchscreen on the phone.  The entire thing wiggles a few cm each time.<br /><br />3) The coiled cord may SEEM nice... but it really is just in the way most of the time.  I would rather have a long straight cord I could route properly around the top of the windshield and around to where the cable plugs in."
Cheepest piece of crap ever total waist of money  !
It works fine
The sound is clear and it performs as well as any other name brand device.
great price and works great
Best low priced bluetooth on the market.
I used this all over Asia and the key for me was peace of mind. I don't want to investigate or count on the item I'm using switching voltage. This made it all worry free. It comes in a small box and has a slight hum which I could only hear when I stood near it. It's very well made and definitely worth the price.
"Great sound for the money, fast delivery."
"Great deal. Didn't realize this came with 3 screens when I got it, which was a nice surprise. The screen was nearly fool-proof for applying cleanly and perfectly aligned with all the hand tools included. There's a link to the video instructions to make the application easy to understand. Recommend this product"
I love this case! The two piece cover fit perfectly and are super durable. Such cute colors and design. Will definitely order more cases from this company.
"I bought this for my new phone, and love it.  It's very pretty, and looks just like the picture."
poor quality.Never buy it again!
Charges our Samsung S6 pretty well.  It is a little touchy as to where the phone needs to be placed to charge it.
Good tough case just scratches easily
"This case is very well made and designed fitting the phone beautifully. This case offers a very high level of protection for both phone and screen from water as well as dust, dirt or accidental damage. The case is both easy to fit and remove. When fitted you are still able to utilize all buttons and ports- afterwards just ensure to properly fit the protective seals so that the case remains waterproof.Overall this is a very well made and designed case which is both easy to fit and remove. The case provides a very high level of protection from water as well as dust, dirt and accidental damage. Highly recommend."
"The ubiquitous mobile phones have become an indispensable tool of modern living. They are expensive and fragile, and therefore they need to be protected from the vagaries of the environment and accidental impacts. This has led to the development of a variety of protective cases, of different brands, price and quality. The most expensive are not necessarily the best.<br /><br />The iSelector Waterproof case is one of the best overall such cases on the market today. It is exactly as depicted in the photos and described in the sales promo. It is sturdy, made of TPU, molded hard PC plastic and Tempered Glass Screen Protector that  works flawlessly with iPhone 6's Touch ID. The case weighs 2.51 oz/ 11.5 grams and is 0.5&#34;/13mm thick. The granular surface is slip-proof and the reinforced corrugated corners absorb most impacts. All ports, buttons and controls align perfectly and are accessible. Package contains the case, a tiny flathead screwdriver, a lanyard and user manual. Set up is easy and intuitive.<br /><br />I tested the case by placing tissue paper inside it then buried it in dirt, tried to scratch it with finger nails, dropped it from a third floor balcony on concrete and finally, fully immersed it overnight in a sink full of water. The results confirmed that the iSelector case is indeed waterproof, weatherproof, dust/dirt proof and shock proof - no scratch, no leaks, no cracks, no dirt - nothing, nada!<br />Headphone port only fits the original Apple jack and does not require an extension (contrary to most cases on the market).<br />With the phone inside the case, sound quality is excellent. No damping or muffling.<br /><br />I took my iPhone 6 (inside the case) with me on a boat ride this week-end and, for the first time, did not need to put it in a cumbersome plastic locking &#34;waterproof &#34; through which one cannot dial, answer a call or take a picture - all of which I was able to do easily with the iSelector Waterproof case.<br />I really like it and shall keep my phone well protected inside this case.<br /><br />I received a coupon to purchase this item, but with no obligation to write a review.

"Was under the impression that this product filters OUT blue light (i.e. it is red-colored). This is not the case. Rather, it does the exact opposite, it is blue-colored, filtering out red light. This is useless to me. Ordered this product for use on a 2DS in nightime, as there is no equivalent of https://justgetflux.com/ or https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&hl=en for the 3DS family of systems."
felt cheap plastic
Works just as I needed. Great adapter.
Nice and good work..
"Bad fit, wish otter made case for maxx."
Bought this case and loved it at first until it broke a week later! Definitely cheaply made. Not worth buying again.
Case is too big for my phone. Case covers up part of flash and phone slides around  inside case a little. Major disappointment.
Best iem's I've ever had.
very good product
I Love this case.
It worked. I was able to connect the iPod adapter cable in my car to my Android phone.  Any audio from my phone is transmitted through my car's stereo system.
"I wanted these headphones for workouts.  I only used them for weightlifting (no high intensity cardio, etc.) and I could not keep them in.  They were a pain and I was constantly messing with them.  They may be great to watch a movie or to listen to music while stationary, but NOT while working out.  The sound was great, but they did not meet the needs of what I wanted."
This product DOES NOT fit the Samsung Galaxy 5 as indicated! I didn't even use the case for 2 seconds and it's already damaged my phone!<br /><br />CHARGING AREA; Samsung has a water resistant cover for their charging port. The Empire MPERO IMPACT opening is not long enough to allow the samsung charging port cover to open which has caused mine to snap off and break!<br />OUTER BUTTONS; The volume and power buttons do not align properly from case to phone so none of your functions will work.<br />TOO BIG; The entire case is just too big in areas and too small in others...terrible design!
Good case very thin. I only didn't like how when my phone  was in my jeans I took it out and the edges are turning blue and it won't come off. Overall good case.
"Orzly protective case for your smartphone<br />A smart, black, modern, light weight case, neatly packaged in a well designed box which visibly highlights the  benefits and suitability of the product.  Easy to open, no extra wasted packaging, simple and well thought through.<br />The box was accessorised with a small booklet containing Orzly products and other bits of interesting information.<br />The Orzly protective case has no buttons or zips but can be opened by simply lifting a magnetic tag, great for those without great manual dexterity!!<br />The inside case houses two pockets, great for credit cards or important bits of information without the need to carry extra wallets or purses around.  The smart phone can easily be slotted into the allocated pocket on the opposite side.<br />An ideal product for those who want a no messing, light weight product, an attractive elegant accessory for the smartphone!!"
Great!
Best price and good quality
Good movie. A lot of true facts came out.
"This watch did not match the expectations I had for a smart watch. The display looks not as clear as shown in the pic here. The rubber cover for the USB is of very poor quality. It can rip off after few months or weeks. When synched with my iPhone 5S, the watch freezes. Calls can be made through it. Quality of call is ok. Photos and Messages can't be accessed it requires another application to be installed."
Good qualities and a great seller.
"It’s make more easy to charge your phone beside it’s help me to keep more organize my desk, the only think I see if u own a IPhone  (5, 5s & 6) the audio jack it on the bottom so u probably will not be available to charge you phone and listen music"
Wish it would pick up iPhone
It was so easy the replace came with tool and all
Great deal! Love the length and definitely charges quickly!
Don't buy this item!  Had less than a week and the elastic pouch expansion has already ripped half way thru.  Don't waste your $$$$!!
"Used this on a trip to Mexico.  We even took it on our way swimming in the ocean to the hidden beach in Puerto Vallarta.  It did not get wet.  While we tried to hold the phone out of the water as much as we could, it still was submerged for long periods of time.  I highly suggest this cheap but effective case.  It isn't pretty, but it works.  To sample it, I filled the case with toilet paper and then closed it and submerged it i my sink for some time.  When the TP was not wet, I know it was safe to put my iphone 6 in it and take it to the ocean!"
"It's already cracked within the first few months. I've never had a screen crack with or without a protector, and my phone hasn't gone through any more damage than usual. I think this protector might be a little too rigid and that may be why, but I wouldn't order this again."
In the description of the item it states that it has a protective cover so that it could be waterproof it does not come with a protective cover so that cannot make the item waterproof
Nice phone for the price.
"detector works very well, and looks like a premium model."
O.K.
Did not meet my expectations. Was expecting something totally different. Case already had several scratches when I received it.
Seller is fantastic; cable shipped is quite good quality and works absolutely fine. I recommend to others.
this one works perfectly where others have failed.<br />worth the extra cost.<br />good job monster cable for keeping the old tape decks usable.
They fit great. Very adjustable. Very light.<br />I returned them.<br />ALL TREBLE. NO BASS.<br />Unbelievable.
EXCELENTE
Good case
Does everything it is s supposed to.  No issues.
Good
"Wonderful quality, much better than I expected for the price.  Very pleased with my case!!!"
"Works fine, no problems."
stopped working after one use.
"Very nice straightforward chargerss. I wanted something small and handy to use for plugging in my extra electronics for charging. I keep running out of wall outlets for usb plugs.This 2 pack Wall Charger set was perfect so I can carry both with me when traveling as well. I am always looking for an extra plug to charge my phone. They work for mobile phones, tablets, and the other smaller devices. They look really sleek and shiny and the plastic is by no means thin and it can handle a little tossing around just fine. I can charge my Samsung Galaxy S6 and my external battery pack without any issues at all. These wall chargers are way better than the original wall chargers that came with the products, and they charge both products faster than the original plugs. I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest."
Product is exactly as described. It fits the watch perfectly and looks great.
"I have always bought Spigen cases and so far the case has been great! It is thinner than the Tough Armor case.  It seems that it will protect my phone if it's dropped.  I see some of the issues that other people could have about the plastic breaking.  I don't take my case on and off often, so I hope I don't have the breakage problem.  Not bad for the price. The only complaint is that the color I chose was a bit darker than I expected."
Exactly what I was looking for. Prompt delivery and service. Intend to buy another for back up.
Great three in one charger.
They are not so good!
It charges fairly quick. I like that it can charge my Kindle and my phone at the same time. The only downside is that it is big and sort of heavy. But you need that for all of the power it produces.
love it...
Excellent product
"Lightweight, sturdy, and easy to hold. Perfect for general protection."
Great product.  Fast shipper
Excellent.
Great sound quality and comfy.  Also has a good battery life. I would Def recommend to anyone.
No issues
"very good case, it works wonderfully."
Great!
Used this on my daughter's ALREADY cracked screen.  It did seem to stop the crack from getting worse.  She got no further damage to her phone while she used this screen protector.  Wished she had this to start with.  Make sure you have a clear work space when attaching the cover.
Didnt even work
"Best thin case there is. (4.5 stars)<br />I'm testing a few other cases and wraps for the Note 5 and this is truly a thin fit.  I'm not a case guy, I feel like you take away the beauty of a modern phone when you try to gussy it up, but also the slim slide and fit into your pocket is lost on most cases.  I'm looking at these because the Note 5 glass back is a finger oil magnet!<br />My feedback with percentages to ‘weigh’ the values of each:<br />Pros:<br />-Ultra thin and light, this plus glass protector, all I need if I'm doing a case (80%)<br />-Buttons don't have covers, this is fantastic.  Many cases have good ways to get access but they always loose some level of tactile native use.  Bravo (20%)<br />Cons:<br />-Not really a good 'bumper' case, as they've got split corners instead of re-enforced.  While this helps with my thin case desire, I don't think any common corner drops will help.  Time will tell (70%)<br />-The back is slightly greasy fingerprint prone.  Wish they would or will make a textured ultra-thin back (carbon fiber!) (25%)<br />-Spigen puts &#34;Auto Focus&#34; on the back of many/all cases.  I don't get it.  If they wanted a standard decorating companion to their logo, they could find much better I’m not marketing guy but contact me and we'll come up with a jazzy slogan like &#34;Just shoot it&#34; or &#34;Peep hole&#34; (5%)<br />I purposely didn't buff up the case to show the fingerprints, so this is why they lost half a star, but we all buff our phones a few times a day anyway, just wanted to show you.<br />I've bought 3 cases so far this is the one I'm using as primary.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
"I've bought 3 of these and love them.  I plug a lot of usb devices into the one by my bed (iPhone, iPad, Bluetooth headset, Pebble watch, and often to recharge portable batteries).  So the fact that they handle various needs is wonderful.  However, one failed (apparently heat related,  if I unplugged it for an hour, it would work again, for a while, before it stopped working).  I contacted their customer service by email and included my Amazon invoice showing that it was only 6 months old, and they sent me a replacement that arrived in 2 days.  Jaimee of Photive was super helpful and I definitely would buy another Photive product.  Also, the one that failed was a 50 watt unit and the replacement was 60 watts -- apparently it's been upgraded and they sent the newer product.  Well done, Photive!<br /><br />By the way, the third unit is kept in our family room on an end table, and I keep extra charging cables in a drawer under it,  this way visitors and family can easily put their phones on charge while visiting,  and when the power goes out, I pull out a fully charged UPS, lug in the photive, and we keep our phones charged easily,  no more unplugging someone else's charging phone so MINE can get charged,"
Excellent charge cable nice and thick can't beat the price.
works great
official samsung product CONFIRMED.<br /><br />charges my phone in less than 2 hours O_O ... this thing has the good original speed. It's probably best to buy this cord from the seller named &#34;samsung&#34; because other sellers might indeed have a knock-off copy.
Not a bad idea to a spare!! Great product.
"If you are purchasing this phone thinking a person with limited tech ability and/or limited physical function can use it, DON'T!!  I couldn't be more disappointed in it.  The instructions are worthless.  They don't tell you there is not voice mail capability.  The ringer randomly rings.  The speed dial will not accept a number.  I have tried calling the customer service line several times and have sent e-mail questions, with no response!<br />When we get a replacement phone, we are going to celebrate by smashing this with a hammer!!  Anyone not wishing to waste their money should not purchase!"
These are soo cute and easy to use got here fast
1*
Very accommodating
String broke off and case is not sturdy at all
meets my needs
"Very easy to put on , works really  good"
Had everything I needed
broke the first time I used it
Great Price!
Wife loves it.
Love the look!
Very good
Stopped working one month after purchase
It was steal and more sturdy than I thought too bad I got turquoise instead of black
"Looks great on my Samsung Galaxy 6 Edge Plus, light weight matces the color of the phone great and does not take away from the beauty of the phone."
Easy install and NO BUBBLES!
It worked great
"This portable battery charges my phone faster than the actual cable! The only negativity I have towards this product is that it takes a bit of time to charge BUT that was stated in the manual. The size is fine in my opinion, it is bigger than average battery packs but it charges my phone within reasonable time. My sole intention for this purchase was to use during vacation and in school.<br />A unique feature of this battery pack is the flashlight that is activated when you press down the power button.<br />The functionality of this battery is simple and it doesn't require to much time to grasp the concept of this battery."
"First, your phone will be safe, and if it works, the pics will be fine.<br />That being said, here are all the problems I've had with this selfie stick:<br />1. Sometimes it doesn't connect to my phone. After turning the bluetooth and the selfie stick on and off various times, it might connect after at least five minutes. I've had other people use it, and on some phones it works okay, but other phones have the same problem. All phones tested were iPhones.<br />2. The &#34;stick&#34; doesn't slide well when I open/close it. There's too much friction, and even putting some WD 40, it's not smooth, or it won't open all the way.<br />3. The rubber part on the handle isn't even attached to the stick, so it keeps turning/moving and the button for you to take the picture gets misaligned with the rubber cover.<br />Overall, it's just terrible. I would have paid $5 more for a better quality one.<br />UPDATE:<br />4. I opened the selfie stick again, and it just came apart. Look at the picture.<br />UPDATE 2:<br />Nexcon has contacted me and offered a new product or a full refund."
looks and feels nice. Phone has survived some minor drops so far
"Great product, very durable. The only issue I have is that it is not easy to take off and put back on. Still worth it though for the money."
Haven't had a chance to use it yet. But it arrived ok and is fully charged and ready to go.
pretty and fits.
The feel of the material is very cheap. Gonna have to look for something better quality.
Excellent
I thought this battery would be like a new battery however it has not performed as one.  I followed the instructions on charging and have found within the weeks I have used it that the charge does not hold any longer than the prior battery.  If I would have known this I would have kept the battery I was previously using.  Very disappointed.
I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.i love this case on my phone .. it snaps on easy and holster onto my hips with ease.. very sturdy and phone wont be able to fall or isnt loose..
This is a perfect phone to buy if your on a budget or not.
I've used this a few times already since purchasing it. It keeps the phone dry and I don't even notice it's on my arm while running. Thanks!
Great case for the price... I used it for about 6 months and have now purchased other designs... I like to accessorize and this was nice! CUTE and worked great for protection. I only changed because of style... I think this case would last more than a year.
"Bought these expecting them to last me at least a few months (couldn't argue with the price) but they lasted one day, with just using them at home.  The left headphone has already stopped working with under an hour of use.  Very unhappy with my purchase, I would not advise anyone to order these.  They seem to be built good and they appear to be durable, but no it is in fact the exact opposite."
I like the product and the service.
Very pleased
"I mean, they are pretty cheaply made- you can tell that right away. However, the sound isn't bad and they get pretty loud. I've had them for about a week now and haven't had any noticeable trouble. I'm most likely going to return them at the first sign of any issue because there are more credible headphones at a similar price. But franky, for the price I paid, they're not as bad as everyone is saying."
"My button is hard to press. Can't get the led to turn on.<br />Sent an email, hopefully they'll respond.<br />I may have received a defective product."
On and off key can't be operative after using this cover.
"Good looking product. Too thin to protect from drops, but good enough for basic scratch protector. Very thin product. Port covers off great feature."
"The worst purchase I ever made. These things skip all the time, even if I'm standing and my phone is at my hip. I tried endlessly experimenting with the combination of the different sized ear buds and the pieces that fit around them that were provided but no luck. Huge waste of money. They fall out all the time much less with the slightest amount of sweat. Seriously junk."
Second hand and dirty
Excellent product and great customer service!!!  I will order nothing but these from now on!
Love it works great
"I love it, protects my phone really well"
I love the look and feel of the Soga Bling cases.
"Pretty and not bad for the price. I'm basically happy with it, but be aware it won't close if you have more than a couple credit cards in its pockets."
The closing part is already wearing out but I do love the case
Have received nothing but compliments on the color.  It has protected my phone several times when it was dropped.
The picture clearly shows the protector fitting the entire screen. However it barely covers half. And it looked like poor quality too. I returned mine.
Good
i hav e a i phone 5 s and use a lifeproof nuude i dropped my phone in johnsons pond in coventry ri .it dropped it in 8 feet of fresh water for about 3.0 hours until we found it. we face timed it because the water was black and it was dark out . we found it and it works perfectly.also had it replaced for free 2 times because i sat on it and the edges had gotten distorted and they replaced it for free.t<br />  thank you life proof you are worth every penny.my neighbors are getting them now that they saw it works<br />philip casacalenda<br />coventry ri
Good seller and product
Stopped working after 3 weeks. not worth it!
I like this product but i think that the cable are a little thin for a dash board camera
"Great portable battery pack, and at an excellent price. It is a must have for anyone with multiple portable devices. I ordered this before taking a trip to Reno. It was more for my son since we let him use the iPad so that he could have something to do while we were on our way(by car) to Reno. This battery pack provides the extra juice necessary for the iPad and my iPhone.<br /><br />The LED light also comes in handy, but there is a negative. The light isn't straight, and points downward. Other then that, this thing is great!"
It's GREAT.
Husband loves it -  Has it on his golf cart.
Poor quality only lasted three weeks
They do what they are supposed to and last.
Dropped my phone 4-5 times on accident after putting the case on. Still not one scratch on my phone.
Excelente
"Looks classy and great on my blue iPhone C, seems to be a very sturdy protective case, light up feature is awesome the front lights up as well. Lovee it my new favorite phone case!!!😀 and it also came very quick in the mail. Gotta love Amazon right !! Had all my friends amazed with the light up part and it's very sleek on the phone with good  buttons that are actually easier to press then the phone without the case."
"delivered on time,great condition,works wonderful easy to set up, I love it"
"Best earbuds I have ever bought, and I have owned some Beats and other name brands. Fits comfortably and really does knock out outside noise; I usually wear earbuds mowing the lawn, and often had to crank other buds up to overcome the lawnmower sound. With these, I can play at a normal level, which I suspect is better for my hearing, and mower is just a light buzz, at the most. Also have a Symphonized Bluetooth speaker, and would (wood?) definitely buy more of their products."
"It's kind of hard to get off without damaging it, but overall I like it. There was a little condensation over the camera lens, so I'm not sure if moisture got in or was already there."
Bought this to take on our trip to Alaska.  Thought it might be fun to use.  Hoping to get pics of ourselves with the beautiful scenery in the background.  Worked great.  It was light and convenient to carry around in a back pack or pocket. It was pretty simply to use once I got the hang of it.
Works great and looks great!
"Very well built case that hardly adds any bulk to the MotoX. Almost feels like it isn't there, and it has also protected the phone from a few small falls."
Just what I expected.
fits my phone perfectly and it got delivered so quickly!
"Satisfied with the product, it was up to my satisfaction."
"I have very skinny arms, but I measured before I bought it. My arm is about 9&#34; around, so this did fit it (just barely). I like the open face of it and the strength of the silicone. It's not as bulky as other brands."
Perfect for taking on trips cause u don't need a wallet.<br />There's room for cash and a credit card..it's a.nice sturdy case. .
"I got this phone about 2 weeks ago and it works great so far.  The phone has some minor damage in the corner however the screen has no scratches or chips.  Before getting this phone,  I got one from eBay at a slightly lower price but I ended up returning that one because it was not working -  was not connecting to the Internet.  With this one, I had  no issues  so far,  and I hope it will keep working well."
"I grabbed these based on the price and some reviews. However, I had fairly low expectations based on past purchases of several brands of stylus.<br />What a great surprise- these styli are solid, a nice length, and write nicely. Despite being a little thinner than I expected, they have a decent heft.<br />They stylus end seems a little flimsy but works just fine. Personally, I prefer this design (stylus on one end, pen on the other) to the 'penpoint-through-the-stylus' style. All in all, a very satisfactory product and deal."
The battery didn't work. It wasn't even charged all the way!!
"I ordered three of these, on the theory that Id get at least a couple of good ones.  The gold one, would not pair, no matter what.  the Black one the power switch was not connected to the circuit board, the black and red, worked alright, though if I had phone, and media connected to my Note 4, the answer button, or hangup button, would not work.  Since I mostly used it for listening to music, I felt I could deal with that.  Now, less than 6 months later, the only semi-corking one, has decided that it will no longer charge, and is dead.  Ill order from a reputable vendor, and give al these copies a pass from now on."
"Excellent cellphone for people who uses the phone for WhatsApp, facebook and call and send messages."
"This is my first time buying a portable phone charger. I bought this based off of the reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />I haven't had any troubles with this device. I received it the next day after wording (something that has never happened...maybe two days later, but never the NEXT day). It came in a neat little box, complete with the device, a small cord, a dust jacket, and the instructions. I will say that the instructions are crap, hence the 4 stars (I would give it 4.5 stars). I love pictures as much as the next person, but it gave me the bare minimum on how to operate the charger. To save anyone the same confusion, here is what I know:<br /><br />- Charge the device before you officially use it in public. You hook the smaller end of the cord into the device and the larger, USB side into your iPhone wall charger. You will see an orange glow from the device - that means it's charging. The glow will disappear once charging is complete.<br />- If you do not have an android, the provided cord will not work for your iPhone. Use your phone charger cord to connect the device to your phone. Once connected, press the small button (where you originally saw the orange light) to begin charging your phone. It will turn green.<br /><br />Ok, that is out of the way. The charger itself has some weight to it, but it's still light enough to carry around. It fully charges my phone with no issues. I've recently taken it with me on a plane in my personal bag. It fits in my book bag and small purse. Overall, it is a nice, sleek, and useful little gadget."
"Works great, seems like all the parts are well constructed. And the cords are thick."
"Worst case ever! I was using my selfie stick with the case on. I thought it wouldn't break so I was like whatever. So when it fell of my selfie stick and I saw it cracked, I was in tears!!"
I love how light the pen is and the color.  Works well with my Surface.  My only complaint would be the size of the tip.  It is a bit large and makes some site mobility irritating.
Great.
Lost my iPhone to water. 2 days after getting this phone it was filming my daughter in the pool underwater. Operating systems are so similar I barely noticed the difference. Many compliments on how sharp and clear the pictures are. Overall  satisfaction with this phone is 5 stars..
"The watch works as is promised, but the casing and strap is PoS.  I only had the watch for a month before the strap broke.  Samsung refuse to refund me and 2 days later the casing that hold the straps broke too. It's a shame because the watch it's self is good but now I wasted $ on a pocket watch."
"I love it just as good as the OtterBox defender , which cost so much.....I got the generic one so cheap⭐️"
wife loves it
"I was given this as a gift for Christmas about a year and a half ago.  i have to admit it was pretty cool and worked well for about the first 6 months.  Then the case on the phone started to fall apart and before long the rubber casing wasn't staying on.  So i just decided to deal with it for a while as i never really removed the case unless i needed to gte to the battery or card in the phone. Eventually, the rubber outline on the case was just too flimsy to use, so i came the Amazon and got a replacement case a few months ago and i was happy again.  However, the base would no longer charge the phone.  That was annoying enough, but now, if i plug in a cord charger to the case, that will no longer charge the phone either. Needless to say, i am moving on.  Good Luck!"
Completely satisfied so far. I tested one of the cases in my sink by putting a tissue in it and completely submerging the case in the sink. It worked great. My galaxy s5 fits inside the case very nicely. My brother was able to squeeze his galaxy note 4 inside one of the cases as well.
"I was foolish enough to purchase this phone to replace my moto g,man what a mistake.The memory is awful ,but the quality of the phone itself is the worst.I have had this phone for just 8 months never dropped it or had it get wet and out of thin air I now have lines running across the screen.It started with 1 line right after I used the camera,after that every few days a new line would appear.Now I have about 20 lines running across the top half of the screen and thats after more just popped up while writing this review.I contacted Posh support when the 1st line popped up and they were quick to claim physical damage and suggested I send them the phone for them to analyze to determine if it was damaged meaning I would have to pay to send it back to China probably. No way was I going to do that,so I just let them know how defective their products are and that I will never buy another Posh anything again.It comes with a ton of bloatware it has no notification light even for charging,the USB is at the top of the phone.You can't even turn camera shutter sound off ,the battery life is terrible (a phone from 1995 probably got better battery life).the processor is junk Facebook stalls a lot especially if another app is running.The WiFi is awful,I step on my front porch and lose signal.My moto g I could walk 2 full blocks before I lost my WiFi signal from my home router.The sound quality is the worst of any phone on the planet,the front camera is garbage too.To anyone out there that thought about any posh phone do yourself a favor and just scroll to another brand .Please by all means spend not 1 dime on their phones.AVOID POSH PHONES AT ALL COST!Don't even buy it for a child."
I did not buy this
It's great
These work.  Fit is fine.  My three kids used one to plug three headphones into one iPod shuffle on a recent car trip.    update: July 2016 they still work fine.  No change.
I love it
good quality
very fast shipping..excellent quality
"Update 9/19/2015: I received another power supply sent by Anker's customer support. It has been working great for more than a week now. They are concerned about keeping their customers happy.<br /><br />Update 9/3/15: Company has contact me to get faulty unit swapped out - will post updates...<br /><br />Original review: Started out fine, did great duty on my trip to Kenya in December. A few weeks after returning to the U.S., a port died, leaving the connected device with a dead battery. Now, two more ports have died, leaving only two working. Not worth the effort to return, just to get another that will die the same way (read other reviews). Ports die, do not buy"
Worked perfectly! Had it on my phone in 10 minutes!
impeccable quality and design.. Thanks.
This was for my wife (who goes through cables like water). It's still working! She seems to be happy.
"It fits my Apple Sports watch so much! I actually like the look of this more than the original Apple Watch Space Grey with the Steel Band and that costs $1200 after tax! This band is really well made , very comfortable and looks so much nicer . I love the stitching detail."
Good battery but slightly on heavier side.
Works great shipped fast
A+
"Great screen protector.  Using this Tempered Glass Screen Protector is way better than the plastic ones I've been using.  No finger print smudge or scratches so far.  If you do get finger print smudge on the screen, you can just  use your sleeve or a cloth and it is easily removed.  All in all, I would recommend any Galaxy S6 user to get this screen protector."
Well made
Very nice
Great product bought on Amazon!!
Got these as a temporary replacement for my charger. They worked for what I needed. But then the daggum end of the cable broke off into my phone and I had to try to manage to get it out. Worth it? Yeah I guess. Will I get them again? Nah.
Does it's job perfectly on my iPad
Works like advertised. No issues using it with my Note 3
"I love this phone case it's been weeks and it hasn't started fading at all. It came with a screan protector, the case, and a stylus pen. I was pleasently supprised since I thought it would only be the case! I get compliments every day with this case and I consider it an absolute nessity"
Works just as well or better than the one that came with our life proof case (& we lost!) Great follow up customer service as well!<br />Recommend.
It keeps falling out of my vent.  Not happy with it
I think it's been a month already and this USB cable is still intact and working well. Seems like it's a really good quality charger.
Works great.
"Cute, fits well.  Slippery in hands, though.  I've dropped my phone several times with it."
"Great value for email, web, Facebook, Uber, etc.  First time with Android - easy.  Paired with H2O on arrival in U.S. from Asia.  Working in about 15 minutes following charge.  Prefer the slightly smaller screen / overall size."
"Its hard to get on and my screen protector is bubbling up,and it's hard to get on...worst case ever I have to buy a new case and screen protector."
"It works line-of-sight only and therefore is not very useful if you're driving and want to control the head unit. It's just as easy to reach over and adjust the head unit manually as to aim this remote at the front of the unit. Also, it's larger than I would like."
It worked
GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT
i bought this a while back....didnt use it much because everyone said it sounded tiny .......i used the mic on a baofeng and a wouxun
"Don't waste your time or money. Purchased through Amazon, the original and the replacement one never worked. Even went to my local Best Buy and tried to buy one there, the Geek Squad couldn't get it or another one they opened from the shelf to work."
"I do like this case, but something I noticed was that the back of the case is really hard and made of a strange feeling material. The rubber inside is also not as malleable or flexible as I would expect it to be, but it did fit my phone well. I'm just not sure of how well it would protect my phone damage if I were to drop it. I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review"
"a good phone with affordable price,it works well in my area."
"Best $10 ever spent! I initially had issues with pairing it with my older iPhone, but thanks to some reviews on Amazon and great response from customer service I had the headphone on paired with all devices! :) I used it 9-5 every day and it is awesome! Couldn't be happier - perfect for long calls or Skype!"
The RavPower USB charger is very good & works as advertised and I am very satisfied with it.<br />Venkatesh
spot where cards go ripped after 2 weeks.
just wanted an extra one
excellent product!
This is such a fun little device. It fits my giant LG G4 with a pretty bulky case easily and with room to spare. I love the design of the stick. It folds down to about 5.3 inches so it's portable enough to toss in my purse or keep in the car for those unexpected photo ops.<br />The stainless steel arm extends easily and had no problem supporting the weight of my phone. It feels strong and durable and seems like it will last a long time.
"Excellent, perfect time.fast delivery"
Working great !
Good screen protection
Bought this part for my friend who has an issue with his camera. He was able to fix it and works better than his original camera.
Works great does exactly what it is intended for.
"Thin, sleek case that will fit in a small pocket. As pictured & described. Thank you!"
Good but its need more speed
Im happy with it and love the price. It came very quickly
Great will do business again
Great product
very satisfied. thank you.
Just got the case and it's great so far... Love the color and material; it has good grip.
I love the sound. Smooth integration with my iPhone and ipad. Everything works as it should be. love it.
"Nothing new in this watch, same as the other watches.."
"It came on time and it came with the case ,screen protector , pen everything! . it fits perfectly ! And looks really nice and i cant wait to use it next month :)"
Easy to install works as described with my iphone 6 don't have to take the phone out of its protective case either.  Easy to mount.  No complaints here!
I contacted Samsung customer service and I had bought the had I adapter 4.0 and they said I need the 3.0 and that didn't work with the Samsung tablet 4!!!! POS!!!
crap. broke after a week
"It is very safe and easy to install, comes with a clear instruction, plus all the elements to make a good installation; I did not like it a bit smaller than the monitor, and it was difficult to correct if you put evil.It is seen to be very strong, and will prevent scratches and falls."
It was an excellent charger until both USB ports came apart and are so loose it won't hold a USB plug to even charge. I might take it apart to see what's wrong since my return period is over. I popped the case open to find 18650 batteries inside. I only did one corner but judging the size of say there's maybe 6-8 of the puppies in there. It may not work at a phone charger anymore but hey. Free flashlight batteries. I'll keep updating this till I fix it or junk it. UPDATE: I have taken it apart to find 8 18650 batteries. I also found why it wasn't charging. Weak soldering that broke and only connected when I held it a certain way that connected the USB port to the mother board. I will update when I get home again and try to resolder the ports.
"It's pretty bulky, but I lived with that.  The kickstand is pretty flimsy and broke after a few months.  It did it's job, for the price it's not bad but I ordered a different one as a replacement."
"Looks nice and fit perfect.  Everything is as expected.  This may not protect iPhone especially when it's dropped, however, I know it before I purchased this item, so not complaining.  The color turned from clear to darker shade after a few months of use, but with darker shade, it still looks good to me."
Perfect
didnt work much better than my old battery.... should have just got a new phone
"Really cute case and it fits my phone perfectly.  Probably not the most protective case I could have bought, but it has stood up to a few minor drops."
Wish they came in different colors but I love it!
Don't like it not what I expected
"This is an unbiased review of the Maxboost slim case. When I received the product I looked over the overall quality of the product. It is very nice and has all the right cutouts.<br /><br />I tried putting on the case and it was a little hard, snapping it on was an issue for me. After putting on the case I saw the protection wasn't that great but it's a sacrifice for a slim case. If you buy this case it mostly like getting the Apple cases, without a bigger lip to protect from damage to the front of the device.<br /><br />The case is very slim, I have a glass screen protector and I recommend if you buy the case your get the Maxboost glass screen protector as well. It's also slim and you won't get a thick protector. Incase you drop your device this is something great to have."
Great item to allow you to connect your wireless blue tooth headphone to hook up to your tv
"Put this on my phone as soon as it arrived.  8/29, I accidentally dropped my phone on the pavement.  Landed frontside down, the protector cracked but there was NO DAMAGE to my phone.  I have reordered."
"This is a great case. It's sturdy and fits well around the phone.  These cases, it doesn't matter if you purchase it from Amazon or the apple store, does change colors. All clear cases do. I've had clear cases for years from different brands and they all do the same thing.  Highly recommend."
"Yes, this adapter was exactly what I needed to connect my microphone to my Iphone 6 Plus for excellent audio."
Super cheap cracked in two weeks
Sux that this took like a month to come in and it doesn't fit
Fits nice. The swivel is kind of funky.
So far so good - love the heavy duty nature and old school feel of this cable....  update:  I bought a second one - I love this so much..... retro and cool.
"Time is an essential thing bc people have places to be at certain times. But what if you also had a reliable smart watch at your side? The opportunities could be limitless, you could call people through the watch on your wrist, late to go meet someone? Call them through your watch and tell them you'll be late. It'll all be possible if you own this watch, which in my opinion is an amazing product that can help anybody."
Absolutely Ridiculous!!! I wish I had paid attention to the reviews before I got this &#34;case&#34;. I don't know what it is for but it is NOT for the samsung note 4!!!!!! Learn from my mistake and don't waste your time or money!!
"This unit is awful. It is extremely cheaply produced, the walls are thin plastic and fragile, as it arrived all cracked. The unit connects to my bluetooth, but continually pauses the music or begins to make random horrendous white noises over the music. All together, it is just a terrible unit. Don't waste your money!"
"Sturdy, super cute"
I LOVE this case. It shows of my beautiful white Note 5 while still providing some protection. I'll be back if I need another one!
This is my second Otter Box I really like the way they hold up.
"Super fast shipping and it fits my phone perfectly. It was kind of tricky putting it on (it has the rubber case part and the single hard cover piece fits over the back of it and covers the side pieces a little) but after i managed to get it placed properly, it fit great."
"This is by far one of the better case I've purchased for the Nexus 5. I've tried a handful of other ones. Simple enough to not be bulky, and protective enough that it won't scratch up the base and has a bit of extra length over the screen that it protect the screen also if you lay it screen down."
A solid performer as an everyday belt clip with the added bonus of heavy duty protection. I recommend b
"&#34;Really simple device -<br />Fisheye lens and macro lens.<br />+ The macro lens is amazing - I was able to zoom in to text on the say the back of a crisp packet or look at the fine detail of the skin - my iPhone camera would not allow me to do this without the use of the lens. This is going to be really good for photography invertebrates and sections of plants as I go through the summer - brilliant.<br />+ I didn’t think too much of the fisheye lens - but it did do as designed - so depends on your needs<br />+CPL lens-:Eliminate reflections or enhance saturation, and is great for removing unwanted reflections from non-metallic surfaces such as glass or water.<br />These are really good and I can highly recommend - it’s amazing how cheaply you can improve your photography experience<br />&#34;"
Cable shorted out after using only a month
It was excellent that what I wanted
It is just what we wanted. Arrived on time with no damage.
It fit my phone it came right away it has chargers  and stuff
They just sound flat. Replace 7 years old stock JBL 6x9s in my boat and the old JBL's sounded better.  Purchased based on strong reviews but I can't recommend. Thinking about pulling them back out and trying something different. Disappointed.  Glad everyone else likes them.
Love it
no good
"I'm very pleased with my purchase of this product, the phone holder attaches easily to my air vent in the car and I have no issues so far. And suction cup to window or dash works also perfectly.  Would highly recommended."
"Perfect fit, looks amazing. Doesn't pull the hair as per other reviews and as I had thought it would, May be because I have adjusted the band size for a proper fit and not loose. Easy to remove the pins for size adjustment."
I get soooo many compliments on this cover! Love it :)
"All fine, easy to apply, i did in couple of minutes."
Works great looks good love eliminating blue light while charging love the Extra length of the court as well overall satisfaction this is a great product!
This is a nice stand for the apple watch making it very easy to slip it on to charge at night. The bamboo wood is a nice light pine style color. I'd use it more for my phone but there is no way to attach the lightning end of the charger cable so you have to fish for it each time which just feels a little awkward for a stand. If they could include a simple way to fix the cable in the right position to push the phone into it would get 5 stars.
Works great!
Nice as describe also good shipping
"I have installed many screen protectors and this one was unlike others. The halo effect around the edges is a total shame. I'd like a replacement or something. This isn't just a consumer made issue, it's happening to almost everyone"
This product is pretty nice. Feels great in the hands.
Great case nice bulky and protects my screen and camera well.
"[[ASIN:B00Y9WQM6G Mpow Streambot Trapezoid 3.5mm In-car FM Transmitter Radio Adapter for iPhone 6 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 5G 4S 4 3GS 3G Galaxsy S6 S6 Edge S5 S4 S3 Note 4 3 2,HTC One M8 / M7 / Mini]]<br />It reproduces mono sound that seems comming from distance. I'll have to get a different product of better quality.It's not worth for most of us who are used to now of stereo sound."
"Let me start off by saying I was sent this case to review it by the amazing folks at Anker. Now let me tell you why they're amazing. I've bought and used the Mophie and UNU charging cases for my iPhone 6, all of whom say I'll get 125% battery for the size of the case, & yes they do give you that charge more or less. I travel a lot for work and do not have the convenience of having a wall outlet. Nor do I want to lug battery packs around in my purse (but often I do, with two iPhones, a Mac and an iPad sometimes it's needed). Anyway let's get back on track, this case gives me the 125% charge and a little more. It's quite easy on the eyes. Which the Mophies do compare. The UNU cases tend to be much more shiny and as a result often slipped when nuzzled between your shoulder and ear. This case however, stays in place! It's extremely light and if you're someone with small pockets and purses, this case is not nearly as long as the UNU & Mophie (even a hair makes a difference when it comes to handbags and pockets!) lastly this case is secure. Instead of the traditional slide the upper half into the lower half design that both the other manufacturers use, Anker designed a case that snaps in place much like the old Speck cases or standard 2 piece cases that most manufacturers use! I prefer that design as it isn't as likely to come apart or have charging issues! Oh and the price is on point most of the other cases are priced higher than this one... Had this have been on the market when I purchased my other cases, well I wouldn't have a graveyard of battery cases rendered useless due to design and technical flaws. Finally, this isn't the first Anker product I've used. This is the first the company has sent me, and I can't say I would have a problem considering them first for my next purchase for an accessory as every product I've used thus far from them has been FANTASTIC."
As advertised
"Works exactly as intended, cheap, and nice looking.  My daughter loves it."
Good product for great price
Disappointed. I chose this one even though it was more expensive than some other options.<br />1. The glass was extremely thin.<br />2. It did not cover the entire watch face<br />3. It was chipped and then cracked by the following morning after applying it. I can't imagine what I bumped into that would have caused enough concern to check it.
ripoff
They really mean that this product is a cracked LCD screen. Somehow I thought this product was to replace a cracked screen.
What are the SPECS?  SCREEN SIZE etc.....
"Fits great and is a moderate protection for the phone, it came with a screen protector but I was accidentally sent a screen protector for an iPhone 4 not for the 6."
"Great wallet and phone case....at first. Phone case deteriorated quickly. The wear on the case showed within a week, but I mostly ignored it. Then about a month in the case started getting cracks with the smallest amount of pressure, even just from taking it out(never dropped it). Maybe I just got a bad one? But the wallet is great! Sometimes it won't clasp with the phone if you have too many coins in the zipper part, but otherwise it's solid."
It's just ok.. seems pretty flimsy.I wont be using it
"good battery life and powerful little speaker. holds to my shower well, will not hold on the tile in my shower but on the glass. another good product from NOOT!"
works perfect
"lightweight, classy, perfect"
Works fine; no issues altho I have not charged any devices. No more dropped USB as with previous hubs.
This is an awesome case. It is not as soft as I thought it might be. The size is perfect.
My Dad liked his gift
Not waterproof.
"Charges 2 5s's at the same time easily. Nice and low profile, was a lot smaller than most others I saw in the store."
"I'm surprised of how easy it was to install it to my phone. No air bubbles at all, I would recommend watching the video first before you install it. I am very pleased of how it looks on my phone as well"
"Used it for three weeks throughout a tour of the British Isles.  Worked great.  Really nice to have the four USB ports what with two cell phones, an iPad and a Kindle along with two Halos.  And friend who forgot his Kindle charger."
I have in iPhone clock base I plug in to at nite. The bottom of this case won't work
Very clear sound with great range.
"The red while charging and green when done works flawlessly. It is very sturdy, my phone responds every time and it is nice and long as a bonus. I plan to purchase a few more."
Great. ! Mickey very adorable cute.
works great
Works well with XMP3 portable player. Although the one pictured is not what they send. I actually like the one they sent me. It's a Delphi remote that's much smaller and thinner.
"This handset is easy to use,  comfortable for holding with your shoulder or hand.  The earpiece of regular phones usually lets you hear yourself, which this doesn't,  but the sound quality is good otherwise."
"Inexpensive, nice unit for daily driver."
No longer works after 4 days.  Tried removing the phone case and even using it with no case at all but all attempts are futile.  Save your money and frustration.
Breaks easy not sturdy
"They came just the way they look in the pictures! I was so excited to get them and the way the stylus' were, just made the expererience even more exciting."
Excellent. Fast charges Note 4
these r junk buy a real cell phone name brand
Great product. Fast shipping.
This digitizer worked perfectly. After trying two others from local online suppliers whom I suspect were recycling parts without testing this one worked and is still working flawlessly. The tool kit and screen cleaning cloth were very helpful.
These work great in my Galaxy Avant.
Good quality at a nice price
"Don't really care for this one, doesn't seem to endure the rigors of my everyday life; don't trust it to protect my phone if dropped or bounced around."
Excellent graphic and very durable
The bottom hatch broke the very first day I got it. Makes pictures cloudy as well.
Held up for approx 4 months but with normal use holster clip snapped and case broke as well.
"The case is so beautiful,  it is stunning! It fits my Galaxy Note 4  very snug, perfect cutouts for all ports, absolutely gorgeous. I have a white Galaxy Note 4, so the case  looks exactly like in the picture....actually better. I think the picture does not do it justice. My phone looks better and more stylish with clear case and a little touch of fuschia. My girlfriend is so in love with this case, she wants one, too...I might order one as a gift for her, also clear and fuschia ( dark pink)  Update: I ordered another case for my friend and she is very happy with it. We both love our clear cases with just a hint of pink."
Very pleased with this case. My phone snaps in perfect and is held in securely. I use the fold out to display my phone on my desk at is works perfectly.
"Would have given this item 5 stars, had great battery life loved magnetic heads!! However, headphones quit working right at 37 day. They no longer charge or power on."
I'm not comfortable with taking over a radio station someone might be listening to but then again at least it works lol
It doesn't hold a charge for more than 4 hours.  Very disappointed.
I have purchased these before. They work great and have saved my phone many times from scratches. Does the job and is easy to apply.
Stopped working in less then a month.  Too late to return to amazon.  Now I have to ship it back to garmin with prepaid postage for them to ship me a new one.  BOO!
Nice case works well not to bulky.
"I bought my Galaxy Fit refurbished from best buy and I love it so much. It does everything I want it to do and some. You've just got to realize it's not the other Samsung smart watch as in you can answer text but only certain phrases that YOU designate. It pauses, skips, and starts music."
Way better then that boring looking Apple watch. Love it!
"I use this on my bike with a Samsung Galaxy S6 with the Otter Box case. The roads in my town are not that great, and when hitting bumps, my phone doesn't even move. The bands fit just perfectly to still plug in my headphones. The bands do fit very snugly, so I hope they don't stretch over time.<br /><br />P.S. Please don't mind the dust on my bike. I was gone for a month."
"I love it works great. It is convenient accessory to have, a travel set. You can keep in your car so you can take it with you and leave your permanent charger at home."
Great quality Ipad Air 2 connector cord for use with the Phantom 3. Perfect length.
"Love it so far, no complaints!!"
Great product!
"(+) Awesome performance as expected.<br />(+) Zen UI very user-friendly and highly customizeable.<br />(+) All bloatware uninstallable<br />(+) Camera flash powerful<br />(+) Good grip for a big phone - Due to the thought behind the design.<br /><br />(-) Removing the back panel for the first time is tough - google-in on how to, there is a method.<br />(-) Power hardware button not responsive - But thank you touch screen double tap on.<br />(-) Camera not great, but ok - SW tries to fix the HW limitations<br />(-) Screen colors are not very bright. - not a major concern as its easy on my eyes<br />(-) No original back panels sold separately - thus far.<br />(-) Fast charge heats the battery. Worried that it will make the overall battery's life span less as its abused by heat - I use my husbands regular Sony charger occasionally.<br />(-) Weak speaker."
"The tracking is great, app is great. It actually does track sleep and recognizes when you are active. The problem is the design is poor. I have had my up since June and lost it at least once a week. The first week I lost it at work. As a nurse I naturally went through all the dirty linen (yep!) on our unit and found it! After thorough sanitation it was back in my wrist where it belonged. Naturally I blamed myself, maybe I didn't have it fitted properly. Nope.  Ya'll this thing falls off all the time. I have found it between my car seats, in my dogs bed, in the bathtub, in my bed, in my pool.... The list goes on.  Well, until yesterday that is. It is most definitely nowhere to be found. So bottom line, you pay that much it needs to be secure. It works great, when you know where it is."
Would've been a 5 star but the Oder when u open the package is TOOOOOO strong 😣 other than that.. I love it!
The cover is a perfect fit .
"Cable worked fine as a lightning cable - used it in that mode for a couple weeks. Needed to charge an android phone, so popped off the lightning end, used the micro usb end, worked fine. Put the cap back on to charge an ipad, it never worked again. So one use of it as a micro usb cable broke it as a lightning cable. Not exactly a good product."
it does not last long at all one day maybe my old battery lasted longer
"Attractive, eye catching design which still allows full view of the apple logo."
Came in before the shipping date. Looks exactly like pictures. Very durable. Love this case
Very good quality for the price.
Exceptionally beautiful and make your cellphone usage with too much ease. highly recommended
"I have only had this for a few days, but I love it.  It was the easiest screen protector to apply that I have had.  The screen is very clear and much easier to clean.  Even though I haven't tested out the protection quality (I haven't dropped my phone) I highly recommend this product!"
"This is a great case for my son who loves anything white and basketball. In fact, it seems meant to be. I recently passed my iPhone 5 down to him and my feminine case wasn't going to do. This case was exactly what he wanted. I love this type of case (flexible) and it is the only kind I use. I believe the rubber absorbs the shock or any fall it may take."
"I used it with my phone LG G4 and I didn't like it at all. It charged very very slow compare it with the original charger from LG.<br />-<br /><br />I changed my rating because of Aukey stuff, they contact me and help me, also offered a full refund.<br />They are really great even that the charger doesn't work well with my phone it works with Iphone.<br /><br />Thanks Aukey ❤."
think it may be why radio only worked 2 weeks
Great replacement part with perfect fit and color match. Repair done by gluing (with LOCA) the replacement glass back onto the LCD results in a strong result that looks and acts like new. Great product.
Worked perfectly
Great
Sturdy wall charger that fit in not only the wall but in an extension cord also.  Lights up when being used so you are reminded to take it out of the outlet when not in use to save energy.<br />I use it for my Amazon Kindle Fire 2012 and it works very well.
"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
"I spent a lot of time searching Amazon and other dealers for a lightweight but effective case for my new Galaxy S5.  This product seemed to fit the bill and was not expensive, so I figured I'd give it a try.  It is indeed lightweight and it seems to protect the phone well.  Be aware that this product is ONLY for the Galaxy S5.  It won't fit any other phone.  It has cutouts for every place for which access is needed.  I did find that it was a bit difficult to open the cover on the USB port, but the case is so easy to remove when using that port.  I didn't find it to be a problem.  When the case is on the phone, it seems secure and protective.  When I didn't want it on, removing it was a cinch.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to test its durability, because I returned the phone.  If I had kept the phone, I'd be using this case now."
Great case!
"This is a great case, stylish, rugged.  It does add a bit of bulk, but less than others with a similar level of protection.  Feels good in the hand.  It makes my HTC One M9 feel like a Moto X, Which I always like the feel of."
I bought this to hold an iPad Air 2 in a Lifeproof case. It works perfectly.
Poor material! broke at folding lines in 2 months.
"Absolutely the best headset for serious business people who need to hear and be heard on a cell phone while in and out of different environments throughout the work day. This is a no frills headset, you can't listen to your music via Bluetooth through it or hear your nav directions through it (which can be good), but if you want to hear clearly and be heard clearly in and out of airports, cars, or while walking the busy streets, there is none better. With the larger filter on the mic I can drive on secondary roads, 45mph, with top off my jeep and hear and be heard with little to no issues. Amazing.  I have had 6 etymotic headsets, tried the wired version and keep one as a backup in case I lose battery power for Bluetooth version. The wired version is bombproof. Only criticism of the Bluetooth version rated here is it is a bit fragile which is why I have purchased a few of these over the years. Despite the fragility, I keep coming back to this product after having tried virtually every other highly rated brand. Nothing comes close to this if you are a professional and need something that absolutely works, period."
"Fast charging on two ports, normal for others. Other than that, great product, use it for travel too."
"Excellent quality, feels a little awkward to wear but not uncomfortable, mute works well, have not used with Skype, noise cancelation is great."
"Phone looks and works great, unfortunately it wasn't NEW.....numbers in the call log and pictures in the phone gallery when received . Very disappointed!"
the concept sounded good and i bought it based on the video review.  i have to say its not ideal for my car as i am constantly trying to adjust the tripod and vent.  i decided to buy another.  driving is more important than to be distracted with this.
would not stick to windshield
Great case well made.  Customer service top notch.  They checked in to make sure I was very satisfied.  Great service.
I used this charger right after it arrived on a trip and I was really impressed with how well it charged my Android phone. My phone went completey dead 2 times and this device fully recarged it both times. I do not know how much was left on the charer. I would recomend this to buy.
Did not work for me. My iPhone kept falling.
This cell phone case is just perfect for the LG Ultimate 2.  The gold backing is good protection and looks elegant on the phone.  The black hard rubber case provides good protection and keeps the phone from slipping out of your hand.  I would buy this case again and highly recommend it.
Exactly what I needed to replace the old one I had.
This is a really good case .durable and fits in the belt clip great I have put a lot of wear and tear on it and it is doing fine.
Good!
"I have never had a non glare screen protector and while it does add better viewing in highly lighted areas and in the sun it does not have the Anti-Fingerprint and bubble free application.  FROM THE DESCRIPTION......Features: Matte, Anti-glare, Anti-fingerprint, anti-scratch, anti-ultraviolet, bubble-free application, ultra-clear transparency, ultra-strength, and improves handwriting recognition.<br />I still have to clean it as much as the ones that are not non glare and myself and someone else tried to put it on several times and althought we got bubble retuction down each time we applied there are still about 4 little and one a little larger bubble.<br />All and all still happy with the product though, better than the last screen protector I had and a great value for the price."
Works well.
"Ive had this charger for over a year, it is very durable. It is starting to get bent by the charger part (from over use), it still works, though!"
I have bought several of you screen protectors and they are the best.
Not well made. None of the joints will stay in position consequently the you have to constantly reposition the device to see the screen. After two days it went into the trash.<br />This is inexpensive but simply doesn't work. Save yourself a lot of hassles and pass on this one
"Doesn't fit into my Galaxy Note 4, at all. Would give zero stars if able."
Very good etem I recommend I like a lot
Works great
my father loves it
it's great
great
this case is absolutely perfect
Good value for the price. Protects the phone o.k. I've already dropped it and it stayed in the case. Easy to access the buttons and the charging cover. I like it.
"Absolutely horrible. This case is WAY too big for my S6. I can't access the volume or sleep buttons at all. On top of that, the ears aren't attached. Both of them fell off in my hand when I out the case on my phone."
"I was one of the first to preorder this product.  As an avid TCDS believer and user, I had been looking for something small and discrete that I can bring to the office and not worry about the million stares I'd get from wearing one of the &#34;other&#34; similar devices.<br /><br />The vibes work great.  As someone else notes, the effects are a bit subtle, but I prefer subtle than the jittery effects I get from the normal stimulants.  I'm the kind of person who gets all weird when I drink too much coffee and folks notice it.  The stimulant effect here is clear in that I'm level headed and can express my thoughts without the fog.<br /><br />The calming vibes I think has pretty much cured my insomnia so that alone makes it worth every penny.<br /><br />Folks who are looking for a &#34;high&#34; or &#34;low&#34; I think is barking up the wrong tree.  The intent I think is to enhance your mood not be so invasive that others notice.  But of course that's my opinion.  Thanks for the great product!"
Great Case for the price!!!
Nice for the money
"Beware! They don't last! Purchased one in 2014. Stopped working afte at few days. Amazon replaced it per their return policy. The second unit lasted a few months past Amazons return date policy. I tried contacting the manufacturer to no avail. Real shame. When the unit worked, it worked very well and sounded great. Probably one of the best sounding earbuds on the market."
Works super good underwater!
"US Cellular prepaid is just a sham.<br />They only activate over the phone or in person at one of their seven stores located in  Buttkeep Minnesota and AssherHat Iowa.<br /><br />They demand a credit check even acknowledging &#34;yepper, its a prepaid but I gotta check it&#34; and even with a 760 FICO score, still want a security deposit.<br /><br />These were brand new sealed phones from Amazon's stock, not &#34;Fulfilled by&#34;  not some toilet dropped wiped off brick from an Amazon Marketplace scammer but true, actual new phones and making them work is a fantasy."
"Fast delivery, works like original!"
This is the only cell phone that I will use. I've tried the smart phone and took it back and said make my old phone work again. The main reason that I bought this one was that I left my old one in my pants and washed it. Rice in a bag didn't bring it back.
ok
Cheap plastic. Tore very easily. Does not stay in place.
Good deal
It's good..
"Military grade supposedly, back of samsung S6 is shattered. No cracks in case or no holes but phone is shattered on back."
"Nice finishing, works OK with my Samsung Galaxy and I need this device as my car does not have a USB plug."
"Never could get it to work, 2 weeks still not working, Instruction sheet SUPER SMALL ,written by someone who has never had to install one"
"&#34;The headphone have a great sound quality when listening to music. I've been told that I am heard clearly when using it during a call. The headphones are really comfortable around my neck, they're flexible and light. They also last me a long time until I have to charge them again.&#34;"
It ceaps on turning off when the bass hits
"Disappointed with this product.  I purchased this to use with my Samsung S4 and was hoping that I could just plug it in and take photos, but no, I had to download the Camera360 app.  Once I downloaded the app, I was able to take photos, but noticed that this stick is tempermental - sometimes a light touch takes a photo, and other times I am repeatedly holding down the button and nothing happens.  Also, after having taken a  few photos, I thought that they would automatically be saved to my phone gallery, not so with the camera360 app. Once you take a photo with this stick you have to actually save it manually to your phone gallery.  I also tried this stick with my S5 and it didn't work, and I didn't want to download the camera app. Overall, would not recommend."
It is what I expected.  I purchased for my sister so she could pictures in the back.  Works like we thought.
I have this paired up with a 100 watt kicker class D amp. In a ford explorer. It will shake the mirrors.
"I LOVE this tiny little speaker! It is so adorable and the sound is incredible for a speaker of its size. I use it in my office and at home when I cook, and you would never guess how small it is. It is so easy to take with me on vacation. Another plus is that it connects very easily through bluetooth to my phone and computer. (It is much easier to connect than other/larger speakers I have had.)"

"Love anchors, so naturally I love this"
This charger is awsome
It works perfectly well and the price was very reasonable. Nothing to nag about!
approved by wife
This case is so cute and it works well. It does what it is supposed to do only problem is the fit is a little too big and there is no hole for a camera so to take a pic you have to take the phone out.
"great quality, fast shipping"
"This is a great little phone ,really good price for Samsung."
loved it
Input broke really quickly.
"This phone is awesome for the price, the camera quality top notch, sound is loud and clear the screen is big and crystal clear. Storage space no problems, internet speed no problems I just love this phone, I shopped around for 2 weeks before I finally made my decision to purchase the Titan Max, so far I have no regrets."
Wrong one for my phone but a nice phone clip
"Bought this as a gift for my daughter that is always losing her phone. Awesome deal. Bluetooth works great, easy to sync. Great for people that's are always working with their hands and she is always busy doing something. She loves it! Very inexpensive and now I'm the coolest mom ever."
Great deal and fast delivery!
Great
"Came super fast (about 3 days) and is exactly what I expected, definitely recommended :)"
Great product. I love it.  It charges my phone quickly and looks great too.
This is a great product. I was searching all the possibilities to unlock my wife phone and after a video on YouTube this did the trick and al the hundreds of pictures were recover from her broken phone.
"Camera works great! I hard wired it into my truck, which I highly recommend. It goes on and off with the ignition, so there's no worries about forgetting to turn it on. I have piece of mind knowing if one of those annoying bicycle riders tries to ride under the front of my truck again, Ill have it &#34;on tape&#34;."
Product comes with really good instructions which I loved! We attached the cover to my son's iPhone 6 it was a little challenging but eventually we got in on the phone. It took about 30 minutes to apply. We did have a few little bubbles that we could not get rid of but after a few times of removing and putting the cover on we were able to leave only a few little ones and after a day they are all gone and now you can't even tell that a cover is on the phone! Which my son loves. We have tried plenty of phone covers this is definitely the best one yet!<br /><br />I received this product in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.
nice
I got this for my husband. So that he would have a place to set the watch when not using it and because he mentioned that he wanted a case for work.<br /><br />I believe he only wore the case once. He says it does its job he just doesn't like the look of any case on it.<br /><br />He likes the stand it holds the charging cord on there better than a previous one he tried.<br /><br />He wasn't fond of the screen protector mainly because it doesn't give the coverage he wishes it would.<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an honest review.
"I love my Mvp pro 3.0 is a very good battery. There is some this to observe:  1 - I've bought this battery as a kit on Amazon 2 times from other seller and never came with the sub g tank so I bought again from this seller on the option with no tank and retuned the previous items.  2 - it's perfect for most of the tanks but you can read on the manual that will not do coils under 0.4 ohm. So pay attention on that!  3 - it's very easy to use, press the button 3 times to turn it on.  4 - always read the manuals online before to buy it or use it, follow the manual from your coils online to see how much voltage they can handle.  5 - never charge this device on the car or with cheap cables, it's not going to charge cause have protection against bad quality charges."
"Put my iPhone in this and took it out on the water in a Kayak. The pictures were perfect, and I could easily make phone calls and receive text messages."
"Love, as these are 10 ft long."
"Really solid, well built case.  Feels extremely well made provides a lot of protection for the device."
"I've gotten two of these, rated at 100,000 ma.  While they will take a charge from the usb cord, they will NOT accept a charge from the solar panel, which is why i bought them to begin with.  Got a refund on both.  Get a regular battery backup, it's cheaper, and actually works as purported"
I've had this for a few months and it still looks brand new.
"Real good cheap replacement for blown speakers. Not loud or powerful though as you can guess, certainly not more than the factory speakers on most cars. However I can hear music and that's what they need to do. Good for a quick fix!"
Beyond my expection
Does what is expected
Nice perfect to use
"I just got this wonderful  case this morning and I love it! It fit my phone amazingly well! The case was made out of strong material, I tried to pull on it to test the strength of the material and it passed with flying colors.  The colors are very bright just as the picture itself.  Of course the reason for getting the case was the Alice in Wonderland Cat on it.  Shipping was great and tracking was available. It was a great purchase and would recommend to everyone!<br /><br />I received this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
could not use has no grip constantly slipping out of my hand
"when you pull it out, it pulls the charging plate exposing the inside of the phone and wiring."
Fast delivery perfect fit
very good and fast shipping
"Me & My wife have matching phones and matching cell phone wallet cases and we love it, works great fast speed, a lot of space on the phone to save and store data."
"Bought this for spouse. She doesn't like smart phones. Works great for her but cannot turn off data like on a smart phone. Had to contact the carrier and have her number blocked from data usage. Overall, good phone."
Need more things to work with Alexa.
Connnected great. Static on every station I tried when playing music and on calls. I drove all over my city and tried several stations. Too bad because it was the perfect size.
"I used to buy and use oem micro usb's often and I would usually get either the 3ft or 6ft because as much as I like the short ones, sometimes you need it to be longer for my portable battery chargers. When my portable chargers are not in use, I usually wrap my cables around it so I don't have tangled mess...for some reason these &quot;oem&quot; cables end up going back. I'm just glad to have that piece of mind of it not breaking, especially when I need it in an emergency. Not only do these look great, they are strong and durable as well! you can tell by just looking at them."
Very nice  headset
"Wonderful people to deal with.<br />I purchased this item and received it. However when I used it, the connector became loose. I wrote a negative review. It was read by the IXCC Customer Support team and they replied to me. They suggest that I return this item and get a replacement. I did just that. The service was great and fast.<br />The new cable appear much better then the first. I believe that I may have received a defective cord in the first order. That happens.<br />Since the service was so great I am giving this FIVE STARS."
Perfect fit and fits like a coin in tha hand!<br />The battery is really nice and it extended my battery life from 1 day to 2-3 days without charging! :)
Excellent!!
Just great.
I research EVERYTHING.  This product seems higher quality than most and has worked fine for me.
Stylish protection for your phone.
"arrived quickly, work well"
I want my money back first it was not even readable and it was fragile
The RoadMate works good.  Trying to update maps can be confusing.
This extra battery give me the extended life I needed for my LG G3 phone.
So compact and sleek with a lot of power!!
"Fits very well, doesn't block any of my phones components."
"Very easy to put on and so far it has worked better than the one i got from verizon which cracked first day and i didn't even hit anything, probably won't even need to use the other 2. Thank you"
Delivery was as promised. Charger has been working great.
Great seler
Really nice battery pack. My phone is around 3000 mAh and it gets 3 full charges so I am going to assume that it is truly a 10000 mAh battery.
Great product....will buy it again
Won't plug into iPod touch 5 while in otter box case
Didn't even fit my iPhone. Really cheap material.
held up to a few drops and scratches. cheaper to replace this then the whole screen.
great buy
"I would give this a zero if I could. None of the cords worked, absolutely awful product."
Excellent product…what you see is what you get…
"great case, quality price and very durable"
THE BEST
Fit perfect and functioned just as the original. Very pleased.
Had them installed for a few months now. rarely get flashed. much brighter and cleaner looking then my old halogen bulbs. and for the price you cant beat them there cheaper then silverstars and have much better visability!
This was purchased for a friend. She loves it.
Works perfectly
very good
Absolutely love this case. The finish on the back is nice a smooth but the edges give it good grip. I love that the design is not on the outer layer on the back so it does not scratch off. Low profile but sticks out enough to protect the screen and wraps completely around bottom rather than leaving it exposed as others do.
Great cases
Love it
"Though the magnet works great, the CD mount version squeaks like a rabid mouse on amphetamines, even on smooth roads.<br />Seems secure in CD socket, but wiggles up and down enough to squeak constantly"
Had the phone for 30 days and it died just one day stopped working... And the top button was broken.. Waste of fifty bucks
"I enjoy the sleep function including the heart rate monitor.  Although I do not fell it is 100%accurate.  I wake up more thru the night than it records.  Being able to see my steps throughout the day is great and makes me consciously make better choices.  For example, taking the stairs vs the elevator. I have not used the function for recording food.  I like being able to see the results on my phone."
Works great
This product was terrible. It didn't have the side mounts for the radio if I would of kept it my radio would of fallen out when I stopped. When I returned it they charged my $7 for shipping even though their product didn't include everything.
"Got it while it was on sale. It does the job well, and I really enjoyed using it."
"Excellent product, very happy with it."
Easy to connect and comfortable to usa.<br />I highly recommend these LotFancy headphones.
"Great device! It's everything I expected- Charges up well, charges my phone a few times on a charge, and although slower, the wireless charging works well, even though any case I've tried; but here's the caveat probably specific to my device, Sony Xperia Z3v: Because of the angle of the charger, my phone slides down to a point that it stops charging, only if it is bare with no case or protector. So for the wireless charging to work on a Sony Xperia Z3v, it must at least have a clear protector on it's back, or a case. I guess the tempered glass is too smooth for the rubber of the charger to grip. For this reason, I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5, because my device was specifically shown in the listing, but will not wireless charge in it's oem form (without a case or protector)."
I can not get it to stream right. It is so annoying. I am shipping mine back. Maybe cheap but doesnt work.
"This air vent mount for my Ford Escape is still the best design.  My vents are curved like in the product photographs so that my Samsung phone remains upright.  The cool air when the AC is on keeps the phone cooled down, but in the winter this may be a different problem.  This design also clamps down on  my SD slot to my PC, where I can mount my phone for USB charging.<br /><br />The clamp expands to fit a wide variety of phones by pulling the arms apart.  My sample looks solidly built in a dark charcoal grey.<br /><br />I received a free sample in exchange for an honest review"
"It didnt work on my Toyota Venza. It has nice design, but if you want to to remove/ attach the phone several time during the day, you should get something that is sturdy and stable."
Works great! Only took my brother 30 minutes to put in! Definitely happy with this product!
It didn't come with the GPS software CD.
"exactly what we needed, received in a timely fashion."
"Very good<br />Only problem is plastic screen scratches kind of<br />easily, but not a big deal.  Dropped phone several times with no damage.  Nice looking case."
Good quality.
Not impressed. Braided part already starting to fray.
Tried all 3 charger wires. One of them never worked! And the other 2 only worked for about 3 days each.
Fits my Galaxy S5 perfectly. Well made and easy to install. Openings for access ports are exactly right. It only takes a little more effort to open the charging port. Having the case on the phone makes it easier for me to hold it.
Charges devices very quickly
"does not hold a charge very long; operates pretty standard; okay for the price. music sound quality good, but mic for phone is horrible. couldn't use as phone headset. stopped working after about 3 months. they still connect but absolutely no sound!!!"
Great product
nice
Awesome!!
Just what I needed to fix my screen. I recommend this product for anyone that has a cracked screen for the Note 3.
These preformed very terribly. Barely covers the screen company responded with responded with asking for photos and saying there was nothing wrong.. That's how the designed them.
"This product is nicer that I was expecting.  And, arrived early!"
"Great buy!  This thing has a lot of juice!  Exactly what I needed and easy to use.  My only issue was if the device is not drawing power it shuts off--you can't force it to stay on.  Does not interfere with charging, but does for a device that use like a light or something.  Not enough of a drawback to lose a star!"
Works as expected. Not much more to say than that!
Great device and the lights are really nice
Great adapters
The original one they sent me did not work well. I had to resync every single time I got in the car. It was annoying but I lived with it. I left a review stating my dissapointed and to my surprise they contacted me and sent me a brand new model. The new model works completely different and ended up being EXACTLY what I was looking for. It syncs automatically when I get in my car after just 2 seconds. The sound quality is unbelievable. I could not be happier!
very good piece of equipment
Very cute graphics.
"Solid item, just as good as in the pictures online. Case has endured 2 falls no problems or scratches"
"Didn't work for me.  The instructions didn't have enough pictures for me as someone who has never done this before. I used a heat gun and thought I was doing it right, easy, but there was some sort of screen behind the glass that popped off with the glass.  That thing cracked and split like crazy when I tried to use the wire to separate it.  I assume that secondary screen was important since there was some sort of important-looking tab connecting it to the phone that disintegrated as I tried to remove the glass.  Ended up having to trash the phone.  There might be better instructions on YouTube or something, but I wouldn't suggest relying on the included instructions or really trying to DIY at all if you don't know what you're doing."
"The price was great, it fit the phone and is still working.  Thanks."
Did not work with my 97' Buick. Not sure if it was due to my car or due to the fact that I got a jip piece. Pretty disappointed
Works well for long trip but a bit heavy
The image was not clear. It was very fuzzy. I don't use the case.
"Purchased for a business phone, liked the case so much that I purchased another for my personal phone."
"Protects very well.  I have repeatedly dropped my telephone with no problems whatsoever with cracks or scrapes.  The coloring is true to the picture.  The only reason it does not have a five star rating,  is because it is very difficult to clean."
"The &#34;power&#34; button on the side wont work with the case on. However, I needed the case asap for vacation and had to use it any how. I tried to fix it in multiple ways but it just wouldn't work.  Super bummed :("
"PHONE only worked two days, then off and more work. REQUIRE REQUEST FOR THE PRODUCT WARRANTY."
After one month does not work
Had this cable for 9 months and it gave me an error message.  Spoke to the seller and they we awesome and are issuing a replacement cable.  I have a few of these and am overall very happy with the product and especially appreciate their customer service follow through.
I prefer this band over the Misfit branded one. The Shine slides in through the back and it's more secure. Versus the Misfit band where the Shine constantly pops out all the time!<br /><br />Only thing that bothers me is that the buckle is silver and not gold like the face ring. The black straps also have a tiny 'M' pattern on it. Overall good quality and I know I won't lose my Shine!
The case I received was broken and won't stay closed onto the phone all the way.
"I did not work. It is the second time trying to buy this item. I just wanna give up, i do not even want a refund. I am just gonna buy less items thru here."
"It stopped accepting a charge after 2 months. When I plug it in to replenish its stored energy, the lights no longer come on and blink as they did when I first got it."
"Brilliant colors, soft case.  I can see it working well."
This mounting system is fast and lightweight. I was nervous our how reliable this product would be. After watching a few youtube videos of actual testing I felt comfortable buying it. Glad I bought it. I used it for an ipod touch and it is supported very well. It just made it across Wisconsin without giving me an issue.
"I was disappointed the package arrive past the 26 day window in which I was informed the package would arrive. When I emailed about my concerns, I felt my concerns were not being addressed. Nonetheless, when the product arrived, the case fit but the buttons along the sides that control things like turning the phone off did not align making the case useless. I am frustrated by the entire situation and would recommend not purchasing this product. Spend a few more dollars for one less headache and a product that works as intended."
"Quick delivery, case looks great.  Everything was exactly as promised."
Everything is good except the headphone jack. I can't plug in an headphones with the case on. It's probably not the most  protective option but it's better than nothing and very cute. Love the pattern.
"I really wanted to like this cable. It looks so cute with the stripes and I thought we could finally prevent the fraying we encounter from all other cables... One night I wanted to move the charger from one room to the next, but it was so hot to touch. My husband suggested it might be the power box and not the cable. So we switched boxes and it still overheated. We used an old cable on both boxes also and it didn't overheat. Maybe ours was the only one defective but we didn't want to chance it and had it returned."
Great phone! I'm a month into using it and am really loving:<br />how it runs on lollypop<br />the camera and light gestures<br />the battery life ( I usually have &#62;50% battery left by the end of a moderate use day)<br />the voice control.
Has to be charged every night but works well
Love the cover for my phone even has place to put cards for shopping.
Terrible quality. Cheaply made. Cheap packaging as well. Case came cracked/bent. Not recommended
"Fell apart the first time I used it. The white part just fell to the floor in pieces leaving the cord silver. Also the neck,  where the cord meets the head, is frail. As of someone started to cut it off! It works though."
"Works great, higher amperage than many. Nice feature that has a  led readout of voltage / charging amperage."
"This is a very solid, durable case. My husband is a nurse and keeps his phone with him at all times and he loves this case. Only complaint is lack of color options for men (who dont want neon)."
"Very easy to put on, and I really like the lifetime warranty"
"Receiver sensitivity not that great.  Audio output has a little hum to it.  Programming is a bit counter intuitive.  But, what can you expect for 28 bucks?  Going to stick it in my go bag for emergencies."
It stopped working after 2 days of use. I returned and received my money back
"using this to take video on my iPhone that requires hands-free or prolonged stability. Pros: Good price, stable relatively large base clamp, stable easy-to-use clamp on the phone end, easy to manipulate the shape of the arm. Cons: when the arm is more fully extended or hangs against gravity far from the clamp, it has a tendency to sway/bounce with minimal disturbance (e.g., wind, vibration)."
I purchased this in March and now it's 6 months later and it does not charge properly. I have used it 2x as I typically charge my phone in my car. I'm not sure if it was a good device from the seller from the beginning or if it was defective device.
Things to note: The Skip/reverse buttons are in opposite locations and when you press the buttons there's an annoying voice that says 'skip foward' or 'play music' I don't like that. All other functions seem to work fine. Battery lasted about one week with normal use (~2 hours a day)
"Base on other reviews I was not sure about the product; yet I am glad to have made the purchase. The case is incredibly resistant, and it also looks well made."
I should have paid more attention to the 1 star reviewers because they were exactly right. The sound from the earphone has so much feedback that is immediately annoying and unbearable to utilize. Outgoing conversations are fair at best even with the extended boom microphone. The supplied earbuds don't seem to stay in my ear either no matter what size I use. The ear hook design has a tendency to pull the headset away from my ear canal thus defeating the noise cancelling feature. It is a no-brainer to return this asap. Trust me on this or you will regret your purchase.
Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
Pleased with product .
Does not work!! I wouldn't buy from them again!
It didn't work with my Samsung Galaxy 3tab!
Received quickly! Really like the case.
I like it and works very well
perfect
Works great
Truly fit my device.  I was afraid that the size may be not right.
"Solar panel doesnt seem to charge efficently, but the design and quality of this charger is very good."
Great
It is to tight when you have the Otter box on your phone.<br />Very hard taking the phone out of the leather case.
Love the lace look it!
Updating my review.  I received the 2nd device from the company and it has been working great.  When charging by the sun it charges fast.  The first one must have been defective.  Thank you for making it right Just what I wanted and expected. Good product for the $$$. Changing review due to company reaching out and sending another to make it right.  I will try it to make sure it doesn't quit after a few month. I do have to give kudos to company and their customer service. Worked great the first couple of months.  Now it won't charge anything.  The little light fell into the box after the 1st week. Was a good idea but cheaply made.
These Radios work good. I ordered 2 sets of radios. One of the radios had a lot of intermittent static. I returned it and the new ones work great.
This is a very cheap product that felt weak the moment I picked it up out of the package. The sides felt like they would break away from the main screen and screen felt less like glass and more like plastic. I ended up removing it and taking my phone into a repair shop to get a new screen put in that has been much better. I would recommend a different product or just paying someone else to replace your screen for you.
"Amazing cellphone and incredible price!! SImple, fast and confortable, the right balance..."
"Love it!  It's not as detailed as the picture online, though.  The owls aren't as pronounced, but I still like it!"
RIGHT BATT-THANKS!
Terrible.  Plugged it in and it doesn't work. Garbage save your money.
"The new watch band fit my 42mm stainless steel Apple watch perfectly, pretty much like it came from Apple itself.  I had to remove four links from band, which I did with the tool provided.  There were no instructions included so I used a video from the web, which was probably more useful than printed instructions anyway.  I was very pleased with the entire transaction and the watch band looks like it came with the watch.  It's also easy to change back to the sport band that did come with the watch.  Impressive quality at a good price."
Pairing was a little tricky but it seems to work very well now. Very important for us here in NH since hands free is the law.
"Seriously, do not buy this. The battery is worse than the one I was trying to replace. Waste of money."
"Don't buy no matter how pretty you think it is. This case is flimsy, the edges don't snap shut like they should to lock it in place. The case is heavy too. I loved my old casemate case for my iphone5 but this case was a big disappointment."
It is working well.
Love the sound and noise cancellation<br />I feel surrounded by the music without outside distractions. They are comfortableto wear for extended period of time and the folding portability is great.
"Expected the case to be of slightly better quality and the graphics on the phone to be more vivid but when I got it, the case looked very cheap and not to my liking. However, you get what you paid for."
The cover is gorgeous but as soon I open the case and put my cards in the materials were coming over ( the seam)<br />and the case to hold the phone is cracking.
Great cheap case. Only bad thing is that the kick stand is low so the viewing angle sucks.but the tech armor glass fits perfect.
This item is nowhere near the quality of it's competitors. I wish I would have just purchased the slightly more expensive [[ASIN:B00HAAJQ2Q Cellet Ultra-Thin (0.3mm) High Transparency 9H Tempered Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy Note 3]]. The cellet was the first screen protector I had purchased and it lasted comparatively longer that this product. This protector scratched almost immediately when it fell out of my pocket while working underneath my truck. The cellet has experienced this multiple times without a scratch.
Crappy waited for this for my work walkie talkie and it dont even work what a waist of my time and my money
Finally a product that looks and functions exactly as it looks in the picture! It was right on time. Couldn't be happier!
"Excellent product. Arrived quickly, setup was extremely easy and quality is clear. Using LG G3."
"This is a very good GPS unit, however it had some navigation issues and caused me headaches in places that had a lot of traffic so I have to give it 2 stars.<br /><br />The GPS took a very, very long time to download the initial update, it was not 8 hours, but it was at least 3-4 hours. You also have to connect it to a computer, it cannot download the updates over wifi. I did not have any trouble with this process at all.<br /><br />Some states you cannot attach this unit or anything to your windshield,, since the device comes with a windshield mount, so you have to be careful if you are driving through a state with this restriction as I am sure it would be an instant ticket from the police.<br /><br />The highway navigation on this GPS unit is very good, it is very precise, and plenty of time is given to make a lane change. This I definitely a feature I appreciate.<br /><br />If you are trying to find anything off a highway then the GPS would excel at this, if your destination is just off a highway or relatively close to one. I took a trip to an area that I do not know too well with the plan on relying on this GPS to get me around safely. Since there is a lot of traffic in this area (and just about every other area that is a major city in the USA) it fails at navigating safely through high traffic residential and commercial neighborhoods. I would expect that a GPS unit would be able to navigate me correctly and safely wherever I go in the USA, but this one kind of fails at that.<br /><br />It does not tell you whether to go right or left out of a parking lot to get to your next destination. If you are shopping or going to an amusement park you have to guess whether you need to go right or left out of the parking lot to get to your next destination.<br /><br />Instead of telling me to go left out of a parking lot of a shopping plaza instead it told me to make a U-turn around a busy intersection, this caused me to get stuck in a snafu of traffic and cause a holdup because the GPS was not working right and it almost got me killed! I am not even sure if it was a legal turn, that could have lead to even more problems. It also sent me in circles down streets that I did not need to go down. Instead it could have just told me to turn left out of the parking lot and I would have reached my next stop much faster without causing a traffic holdup or snafu.<br /><br />It also tried to tell me to make a right turn down a street that clearly was not a street that you could make a right turn on, since there was no possible way to make a right turn on this street. Again, another traffic snafu, if it would have just told me to go down a different street or just to go straight this would not have been a problem.<br /><br />It does show street names and locations which is extremely helpful, the spoken voice is not a problem to understand at all. Showing the street names and location is helpful because sometimes signs are torn down or are unreadable, its also helpful to show the exact location of each street, so you know, in 3 intersections you have to turn here. This prevents going down the wrong street. This is a great feature and its very, very accurate.<br /><br />If you are looking for a museum or amusement park or some place where the entrance may not be too obvious then this GPS might not do that well with it, we missed the entrance to a museum because we didn't really know where it was, and it was not clearly labeled in an easy to find way. It wasn't too bad because we were able to turn around and go back in. The GPS just tells you &#34;arriving at x location&#34; it doesn't show you exactly where the entrance is.<br /><br />I also had to navigate several roundabouts to get to one of my destinations, and this GPS did surprisingly well with this, then again I was in a slightly more rural area and there wasn't a lot of traffic around. But it outlined exactly where to go on the maps so I did not make a wrong turn, without the GPS doing that,I do not think I would have made it to my destination without several wrong turns as the roundabouts were very confusing, and there was at least 5-6 of them.I do not think I would have made it to my destination without several wrong turns as the roundabouts were very confusing, and there was at least 5-6 of them."
Great!
It's great I use it everyday the battery is better then i imagined
perfect
Works great. Super charger
"Great, even sold a few people on buying them.  The only problem was that after I got mine, there was a promotion for $12 off and I would have bought 5 more but it would only deduct the $12 once, so I settled for one (and to order 5X would have cost 5X the shipping."
Not happy to small and not shown like it does in the picture
I think it's very nice but poor quality. After having it only a few weeks and not even putting it in my pocket it's starting to fall apart!!! I'm not to happy about it
"First let me start by saying I’ve purchased many Anker products over the years, however this PowerCore 20100 I am writing about was supplied as a sample for test and evaluation, and I promise that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />I buy Anker products because 1. They work as advertised,  2. They hold up (my first purchase was an Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh External Battery which has made two trips to Disney World, and I continue to use often),  3. Great warranty (18 Months) 4. The only time I needed their customer support it was top rate. (helping me diagnose an issue, sending me replacement, ultimately resolving the issue in a professional and courteous manner.).<br /><br />Now that we are carrying our iPads with us more often, my wife and I were looking for something with higher capacity than our Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh battery.The PowerCore 20100 appeared to be a good candidate, so I appreciate being sent the sample.<br /><br />My first opinions taking it out of the box are that it's smaller than I expected.  I mean based on the 2nd Gen Astro3's size and the PowerCore being almost twice the capacity I expected it to be twice the size.  While it is taller, it's skinnier, isn't any thicker and feels only slightly larger.  While the PowerCore is heavier (per Anker’s web page), it really isn’t that noticeable either.  Its nice if you need to carry it around.<br /><br />Anker's web site claims it can &#34;Charge an iPhone 6 seven times, a Galaxy S6 five times or an iPad mini twice.&#34;  Based on my usage, that is pretty spot on.  I was able to charge my 2013 Moto X about 8 times.  I was able to nearly fully charge both our iPad 2 and iPad Air 2 simultaneously  (which have larger batteries than an iPad Mini so its what I expected.).  The listing on Amazon has a chart reflecting the ability to charge an iPad Air 1.7 Times, so again, that claim reflects what I saw.<br /><br />Due to Anker's Power IQ technology, Voltage Boost, and 4.8A output, the PowerCore puts out the best current and voltage to charge all my devices at full speed, even when two devices are plugged in.  Charging my iPad Air 2 with the PowerCore 20100 (and an Anker Lightning cable) took the same amount of time as using the standard iPad adapter.<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 does accept 2A input to charge it which helps with the recharge time. I can't say exactly how long it takes to fully recharge as I plugged the PowerCore into an Anker 40w 5 port Desktop Charger before going to bed, along with my other devices, and it was fully charged when I woke.  My estimate would be 6-8hrs to fully charge it.  While using the wall wart from my iPad Air 2 to charge the PowerCore overnight, it took a little longer than using the Anker charger (more like 7-9hrs).<br /><br />In the box you’ll find the PowerCore 20100, a 2ft MicroUSB cord, and a form fitting bag to hold them. Just as with the Astro3,  I put the PowerCore into the bag and left it there. I tucked the MicroUSB cable in side when walking around with it. The PowerCore has 4 LED’s to show how much power the battery has left, and two USB ports to plug in those devices you wish to charge.<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 feels good in the hand and is easy to carry.  I used to to charge an iPhone 6, Nexus 6, 2013 Moto X, Samsung Galaxy S5,  iPad 2, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, Moto 360.  Unlike my Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 12800mAh battery, the PowerCore 20100 did not charge my Nikon S8200 camera.<br /><br />If I had to state a “CON” or “draw back” it would be that I miss having the port for a 3rd device (the 2nd Gen Astro3 has 3 USB ports).  It was handy, especially when in Disney for my wife and I to plug our phones and digital camera in all at the same time.  However, since I would mostly use the PowerCore 20100 with higher capacity devices, like my iPads,  having two ports isn’t that bad.<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 builds on the features that made me love my 2nd Gen Astro 3, while  increasing its capacity without adding that much size/weight. It provides higher output current (4.8A),  adds Voltage Boost,  so it charges my more power hungry devices faster and more often which is a major plus!<br /><br />The PowerCore 20100 is a great External Battery for the road warrior who is away from an AC outlet for extended periods, or needs extra power for their higher capacity tablets."
The feel of the screen is just perfect and any grease or mark goes off with ease. The size of the screen is exact but make sure you place it right. Would have liked it if it there were just a little more copies of the tools that you need to stick the screen onto your phone.<br /><br />Caution: Be extremely careful with the alignment!
"Excellent case. I was a bit puzzled at first how to open it, so a little slip of paper saying &#34;push&#34; may have helped! But so far, ii has been great. Tough, good looking and strong!"
Easy to apply. No air bubbles at all.  Edges not quite covered but still should give great protection
Awesome
"as described, fast smooth transaction Thanks"
"Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service..."
"It broke after about 3 months of intermittent use. The plastic flange that held the suction cup to the base snapped off. Also, the head swivels too easily, even when the ring is tightened down."
The battery lasted 8 days.  After the 8th day started getting the message &#34;Invalid Battery&#34;
"I got this to review, and I requested with a friend in mind. I gave it to him and he loves it! He said the only thing he'd change is at the bottom where you charge your phone it's rubber. He said he would have preferred it hard cassed all around.<br /><br />But he was over all happy'"
Came out good
Nice case but not enough protection for someone with my record of drops and flings. The paisleys are very pretty...makes my white phone look Lacey.
Good!
"This thing is hard to put together. I mean, granted, I didn't read the directions, but how hard could it be? unscrew some stuff, clip it on, put the base holding the phone on. 1. it doesn't lock the base on. 2. it moves constantly. 3. once you remove the ball that allows you to adjust the angle, you can't get it back on. Not as great as people made it out to be, but it's a decent purchase and if I had to do it again, I would have liked to know that the thing actually holding your phone doesn't actually lock onto the rest of the apparatus.  Update: 9-21 about a year after purchase It broke clean off where the suction cup is glued to the plastic. How unfortunate. It wasn't a great product to begin with and now because it is not sturdy or long lasting, I've downgraded from 3 stars to 1 star."
"The materials and construction quality are excellent. I am not sure exactly how many times I can completely charge my modern/large screen cell phone with the Jackery at full capacity, but I can confidently say at least three times. I own one (so far) of this particular model and the wife owns two. The price is extremely reasonable and simply fantastic as a Lightning Deal. Highly recommend."
I got it last week and just started using it and so far it works great.
"I love this little speaker! It has better sound than other speakers in this price range, and I like the way it functions better too. I had an older version of this very speaker which went bad on me, and Noria reached out to me after my bad review, and sent out a newer version to me free of charge. This newer version has a gentler &#34;speaker on&#34; sound, and doesn't have a &#34;speaker off&#34; sound, which I'm really glad of."
Hooked it up to a 100 watt per channel output.(with crossover for high output only)<br />And it still damaged 2 of the 4 speakers i purchased.
A must have! Worth the money. Great power reserve.
works great.
"Mounted it to my CD slot in my '98 Buick Regal in a few seconds, and it covers my clock display only a little.  I put both magnets in between my Otterbox Commuter case and my iPhone 6 Plus (fits perfectly, can't even tell the magnets are there) and my phone is very secure on the mount.  Only time it fell was because I had not matched up the mount magnet well at all with the phone magnets when I set the phone on the mount, and even then it still held my phone well until I hit a severe bump.  This mount in combination with the JETech FM transmitter is a godsend, the latter especially for older cars.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*Ridiculously fast and easy installation<br />*Can rotate the phone to landscape without taking the phone off the mount.<br />*Holds my honking big iPhone 6 Plus with Otterbox Commuter case VERY securely (most important factor for me).<br />*SAFETY = improves attention to road (Don't have to fumble for phone, have it sliding around loose, falling, or sitting in your lap).<br />*Can see GPS navigation on the phone, switch songs, watch videos/movies, control phone calls, use earbuds with built-in mic.<br />*Can more easily hear if you get a call, txt, email, etc. especially when listening to music.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Blocks my clock display a little<br /><br />**TLDR: Works PERFECTLY with an iPhone 6 Plus and an Otterbox Commuter case using both included magnets. Fantastic for controlling music, calls, videos and GPS from your phone while enhancing safety."
"This worked great for 3 days. I took it with me to a tennis tournament where I knew my phone usage would be heavy. For the first 3 days, I was able to fully charge my galaxy s5 about 4 times. On the 4th day, I noticed that the device wasn't holding a charge and would only charge my phone for maybe a minute before it automatically shut off. If this worked like it did in the beginning, 5 stars for sure."
"this glass cover is is great, it fits perfect and was a great buy.  mine went on as easy as you could expect.  the dealer got right out super fast.  I recommend this product and the dealer."
Allergic reaction to the metal clasp and the strap cracks as soon as you bend it back to put it through the clasp.
"Returned it would not work with my phone, waiting for credit."
I got this product for free to review it.  I got it when I was supposed to and it's exactly as described.  I got 2 screen protectors and 2 packs of cleaner for them. They seem very durable and fit on my phone.  I recommend!
very useful
great feel and good leather..
the back did not slide out had to pry it open. would like to return
great charger just like the one that comes with a htc phones
"The phone is very well sealed inside this case, so sealed i have issues getting it opened to chsrge my phone. (Charge cord protective piece is hard to take out) .  I like the wristband it really helps with not dropping the phone. I do not like that is not adjustable. Packaging was great i feel  my phone is safe when it comes to water . So im guving 4 stars. Improve the charge ports seal and the wristband . And ill give this a 5 star and he willong to pay more."
Excellent Thank You..
"These are wonderful.  I forget that they are on my neck.  I have misplaced several many pairs of headphones but not these.  I love that they are wireless as far as no attachment to my physical phone.  The volume, on and off and skip buttons are easy to get to.  The clarity is GREAT.  I would definitely purchase again.  Plan on purchasing my son a pair in a few weeks."
"Overall, I really like this case, it completely covers the phone. Although I have not dropped my phone, I am quite confident this case would do its job. The holster provides a tight, secure fit. The &#34;cons&#34; I have are less about the quality of the case, and more about user preferences. For me, the main downside is that this case does add width to the phone. If you have smaller hands, be aware that using the phone with this case often becomes a two-handed affair. The volume and power buttons are flush with the case, making them hard to find by feel alone. I've had this case for about a week and still struggle to find these buttons.<br /><br />As the pictures show, this case covers the charging and headphone ports. Since I use the charging port more than I use the headphone port, I do wonder how long that cover will last. After charging the phone, the port cover takes some time to return to the &#34;covered&#34; position (the port covers do not snap back into place, but the eventually return to a covered position).<br /><br />In short, this case will certainly protect your S6 and the included holster feels of solid quality. The cons I've mentioned might be user-specific, but thought they were worth pointing out. I thought about returning the case but I have not yet found something that is: thin, has a builtin screen cover, and a holster (only used-sporadically)."
It is a great product. My son loves it
Love it
I love it. Looks and feels great. What can you say about a simple phone case other than it looks like the pic came right on time with prime two day shipping and seems durable enough. For the price it is great. Everything lines up like it should. All the slots and buttons line up perfectly and the headphones seat properly. I hate when you get a cover that things are off like that. So very nice. Seems durable but I just got it so can't comment on that yet but will if there is an issue I will update. I don't think there will be it feels like its made of good quality material and design.
Good product.
"I can call anytime I want without using any sort of hand action. i can call whenever I'm in the gym and working out to say hi to my friends and plan a evening feast with them or anything I'd like. Love the part that it looks so badass and I cal always show it off. I did get it as a free sample tho, but the struggle was all worth it"
Anker is a great brand. Love their products. This charge is great for travel. Light and powerful. I bought one more for my wife as well. Great buy.
"I always love new gadgets or accessories for new gadgets. This new apple watch stand is pretty cool. Serves multiple purposes not just docks it and allows to charge but also provides a nice decorative stand. I have a few stands for my other watches as I actively collect watches (Rolex, Breitling, Panerai and many more). The band holder is actually the right size and you could use this to hold any watch but of course with the cable coming in unless you have a smart watch there is no function other then a stand. But as I'm like most people I have so many devices around my computer and bed it is crazy. Also I do like that it has a weight at the bottom of it to keep it upright as a lot of stands for whatever reason don't and they constantly fall over.<br /><br />I did receive this watch stand at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review."
took less than a month to start coming apart
"Over all exactly what I expected, I knew I would be purchasing a knock off life proof and that's exactly what it is. Overall functions just like a normal life proof. Only bad thing is you have to take the case off every time you need to charge your phone."
"I love this case, does it come in other colors?"
"Works great, and paired right up with my Note Edge. What more could you ask for? Not much.<br /><br />Please pay attention to the warnings about this thing not being for the larger phones, such as the Note Series. I originally owned a Galaxy S3, but had an opportunity to upgrade to a Note Edge before it arrived. The Note phones are too big for the spring-loaded holder. That's not this item's fault, so it's not right to deduct for it."
"For the price it has done a lot for me. Its been a year and a half and dropped in water within the first 2 months. Had to put it in rice but has been working ok after. Every once in a while there's a freeze on it, but otherwise I try not to download aps. I've put a virus scan on it though since I use the internet feature here and there. Volume seems like it could be louder than what it is for dual speaker."
Item as described.
Great
"I ordered this when I could not find my old one.  Considered returning it when I found the old one; however, I like this one better.  It &#34;talks&#34; to you, and it has features my other one does not.  Makes calling easier."
"Bought this for my husband.  He loves it. He carries his credit card, license, and some cash in it and carries it on his hip.  Great product because he has lost his wallet twice."
Works great love it very much!
Lasted about a month.  No longer works
I didn't work
"ORIGINAL REVIEW: Great case- low profile and attractive, seems quality so far (I've had it for a month)  UPDATE: I dropped my phone onto the driveway and the screen was badly shattered, requiring an expensive repair. The repair shop told me that this case really does not protect the phone against damage when dropped. I would no longer recommend."
very good performance and noce price
Works great.  Just what I needed and shipping was fast
I need to send back glass screen protectors
"Fixed a galaxy s4 for a friend's daughter.  I took my time watched numerous vids online and did i mention I build circuit boards (thru hole and surface mnt)  for over 15 yrs now.  So I am well versed with electronic repair.  The board fit perfectly.  When I was done I plugged it in and it charged fine, I made a few calls and the mic worked properly.  I ordered this board from &#34;YUE DA TIME&#34;  from Amazon and the one I got worked perfectly.  I would say though if you have never done this work before go slow, and be observant of what you are doing.  Ppl tend to rip and tear and make the situation worse before they even get the new board in.  Be sure to remove the tape because there is adhesive that needs to be secured.  The process is fairly simple if you just take your time and do it right the 1st time.  From my experiences, brute force and electronic repair do not mix well.  Thx again fixed a s4 for under $10.00"
Performs exactly as advertised.
As advertised.
Doesn't transmit audio
"We have lots of devices charged via USB plugs. Keeping them powered is always a challenge. I wanted a portable battery pack like this one for a while and was interested to see how it would work. It is bulkier and a bit heavier than I thought it would be when I got it but looked of high quality. I fully charged it, noting that it showed green lights in sequence to how full it was charged. I was able to fully charge my iPhone 6 from 5% to 100% within a couple hours, and was able to do this 3 times per full charge of the External battery pack. That meets my needs well and I am pleased with this purchase.  I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review."
"Perfect fit! Great case, better than otter box."
Great fit and looks good. The only thing is I wish the plate covered the entire back.
Works beautifully to go from iPad to TV
"I bought this case for my son and he loves it.  The case raises a little from the screen, giving it some more protection."
They were not anti-scratch.
Loved this case so much. Eventually the colors got a little dull and nasty but overall a wonderful case!
I am a fitness instructor and I use this to hold the transmitter for my mic.  I holds it well and I can move it around me as I change exercises.
"the software is horribly un-user friendly.  i dread having to add music/files.  compared to sandisks sansa zipclip, its the pits.  i hate the display, i hate the organization on the ipod...  the whole thing is counter-intuitive to use.<br /><br />  well, the things i do like is that it holds 20 gb and i got it used, cheap.  thats probably the only things that are good about it. i had a zipclip before and loved it, but there is a defect in how they manufacture the batter connection, so they are all destined to fail, and i wouldnt do that again.  at least the ipods construction is good.  useability on this model is miserable, though.<br />  oh, i hate the thumb mechanism to select files.  man, i dont know why they cant make one like the old 8 bit nintendo controllers.  that would be SO much easier."
Great product!
My daughter lives it and she is 6 and it protects it.
"Nice and long, charges quickly"
"I received this product to provide a fair and honest review<br /><br />This wallet case is quite nice as far as how tightly it fits the phone. The texture of the case is also quite nice.<br /><br />The case is great if you are running to the store to pick up a few things and need to carry your ID and debit card with you, but any more than that and it starts to get a bit tricky. You could not fit several credit cards or business cards or more than a few dollar bills before you have fattened the wallet enough to prevent proper closing.<br /><br />I was very happy with the construction of the case as far as materials used, stitching, color, etc. The only drawback for me was the limits in space available."
has no button to take the picture sucks
I loved it
"When i tried to used it, it wont work, it was damaged"
"Great Silicone Case for the tablet.  Does make it a little hot while on, but not too bad that it affects it in anyway."
"Very much out of the way,and you can leave it in."
"This seemed like a good idea at the time...but I have NEVER used it!  I don't know how anyone would actually use this thing.  Oh, it works the way it was designed and is strongly made!  It's just not practical at all!  I've giving it a 5 star because it does what it says it will do.  I just can't see how anyone would put this on the windshield and be able to drive safely without a HUGE blind spot!  Maybe put it in the back for the kids to watch movies or something?"
Great!
One out of the three has already stopped working after a week!<br />Wrote a request and asked if it can be replaced but haven't heard anything back? Think I'm just going to throw the other possible fire hazards away and eat my loss.dont buy
Nice and large.  Makes it easy to hook on and off pots and pans.
This is a great idea. But. Using two cords at once they each do not hold the connection. Ok for one at a tie but that is not what I ordered it for.
"I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest. I love this product, the size is a little bigger than expected but that's ok. Taking it out the package and plugging it in is easy and very simple. This product is perfect for if you want to charger to things at once without having to plug 2 single USB port and taking up room. Although it is a little big it has its perks. I love how it's fast charging port definitely charges my devices faster. There are light indicaters on it, green means fast charging, blue means slow charging/standby. I am overall impressed with this product and would definitely buy it again. 😀 using this at the moment"
thank you nice
Love it!
This puppy has some heft to it. It is solid and easy to find in you bag. We all have lost power in the worst of places. This solves that.
"Perfectly good case. Good grip, good protection. It is just too ugly for words....what's an Amzer?"
I'll probably order more.  I have them everywhere but leave them in the car or someone else's car.  They are just fine.
havent used it yet.  but appears to be well made and durable.
Easy to use and attach. Keeps phone like new
"This is a clear. Great product, works with all devices and is reasonably priced. The grip works as described"
well
Exceeded expectations. Charges just as well as my fast adaptive home charger. Great product!
This product is perfect!!!!! It's exactly what I ordered. The exact same one that came with my phone when I originally bought it!!!!
Perfect replacement thank you
"I was very impressed with the quality, fit and finish of a brand I've never heard of.  Verus makes a nice case!  Everything lines up and fits tight as it should.  All materials are top quality. The case does not add much bulk to the Note 5.<br /><br />The case was easy to install on my Note 5.  I disagree that the case is hard to take off.  I found it very easy to remove by pushing through with my thumb on the back TPU section while pulling back on the front section with my other index fingers, at the corner where the S-pen is located.<br /><br />I think the case would do a good job at protecting my Note 5 if it fell on it's back, sides, but not the front or on a front angle drop.  The case just doesn't have enough material there. A slightly thicker front TPU lip is needed to increase protection.  Some texture on the sides of the molded poly-carb would help to hold the phone  better.<br /><br />The hair line finish on the back looks very good in person.  Finally, I would recommend this case to anyone looking for moderate protection for their Note 5."
This was for my husband's phone and he loves it.  Would order again.
sounds horrible
"I love the flexibility of this device to both charge cars and various electronic devices.<br />I have not needed to use it for my car as yet,<br />but will update as and when this is needed."
Ordered the wrong case and Gambolex sent me the right one for no extra charge. They were so good about it that I wouldn't hesitate to order from them again and again in the future. The new case fits my tablet perfectly and looks great. I highly recommend this product!
It seems to work fine so far. I haven't got way far away from a station yet to see how it works.
"Very good product, easy to place on phone"
Great
Screw stripped out and it fell apart after less than 10 uses. Junk.
"Works just as well as the one at T-Mobile, and they want 35.99 for it"
"One of the best cases I've abused yet. The aluminum alloy bumper gives it a great unique look and is solid impact absorption. I've dropped twice right on the corner, once getting out of the car with it on my lap, another time it was slapped out of my hand into the sidewalk by a drunken friend. Both times the frame bent and warped a little but the phone is still pristine, not even a smudge thanks to the rubber case that goes under the bumper.<br /><br />The rubber case is amazing too, it sticks out a tiny bit on the front, so if you're like me and like to rest your phone face down, it will never touch the screen on an even surface. Backside has a nice pattern and provides solid grip.<br /><br />The charge port and headset port give ample room for non Apple connectors that might not be a petite.<br /><br />Can't go wrong with one!"
broken in a matter of days
Installed these in the front doors of my 2000 Subaru Forester to replace the ones that were distorting. Had to modify the plastic mount but once installed they sounded quite good. I wouldn't say they were fantastic but for the price they were a great replacement for the old factory ones.
"I'm not going to tell you that you should buy this phone, I'll givethe pros and the cons and let you decide for yourself Pros &#34;Durable&#34;    I don't know if Lg of America purposely makes they're phones in America easy to break the screen but this one Right here is a champion. Dropped this on cement, Hard Tile floor, on the sidewalk, and a few Other non carpeted areas. I don't know if it's the construction itself that makes it strong or maybe that LG Of Korea purposely made this phone very strong since it's marketed to teens and younger folks, or maybe it's because every time you dropped the phone instead of it's falling all in one piece and absorbing all the Impact, the back comes off and the battery comes out oftentimes but when you put it back together it works fine. I even had a few front facing dropS so many times I thought oh my God this is it my phone is shattered but I was wrong I am so confident in this phone that I Could do a ear height drop test anytime anywhere and I'm 100 percent sure it won't break and I'm 5ft 10. I don't even have a case on it it's just the screen protector and that's it.  Good Conversation starter (The Eyes)  you have no idea how many conversations have started Because of this.  Me: *Takes my phone out of my pocket to see notifications*  Her: &#34;Omg, does your phone have eyes? Thats sooo cute&#34;  Me:yeah, it's a lil phone from Korea. The Lg aka. check it out it's eye's move too. It even blinks too Her: Thats so adorable, Im ******* by the way.  Continue talking and i ended up getting so many kiks/phone number because of that but i digress. (It's Still Corvette over females doe) A great way to break the ice.  Audio  The Sounds sounds great coming through the speakers no cracking or nothing like that, it's not super loud but if you put it at full volume here and enjoy it even if you're a good distance away. earbuds, it works with every pair of earbuds I have very compatible. Crisp .plus with the LG software their version of the music app you have the option to increase t, the treble, all that. I love that features some songs just don't sound the same without all that bass.let's see what else can I say about the sound? the notifications can be nice and loud. And yeah if you're really into music this is a great phone.  Design   if you are coming from some other company and you're used to the buttons on the sideit'll take a little while but eventually you'll get used to the volume rockers and power button being on the back. and if you don't want to have to deal with that this phone has knock knock you tap on the screen twice to wake it up and then you can enter your password and all that instead of using the little button on the back. and most of the time you can use the littles options At top to adjust the volume but as I said before it's pretty easy To get used to. Plus the phone looks nice, its not ugly.  Call quality The call quality is decent. I thought since this phone was from overseas the call Quality might be off but now it's on point. Texting works normally too .  The speed  if you are used to be mid-range phones, this is quite a little Speedy One.   The Flex factor  lots of people buy Phones As fashion statement, the question is if my  put his galaxy/iPhone/Note/ on the table and you put yo phone next to theirs how would it stack up? I would give this phone a 7. Its pretty nice and if you keep it clean(its easy,every not and again wipe wit a lil rubbing alcohol) you can flex on anyone. Looks like one of them $700 Flagships. If yo guy friends see the eyes however they might clown ya. But that don't matter. The eyes are cool to me and that's all that matter.  Security Lots of options to keep it safe. Bunch of lock options and it has lookout too.at least mine did you might have to install it.  accessories  If you like customization this phone comes with funny lil stickers to put on it. If you older you might not care but i found this cool.  Weight  Its not heavy. I likes this.   OsThe operating system is Kitkat, I personally like KitKat. it gets the job done and it doesn't have too many features that I'll never use thatll just drain my battery.  Memory   16 gigs of internal space . And thats good considering my other phone before this had 8 . Up to 32 gb with a memory card but I used a 64 gb chip and it's worked fine.  Auto focus lazer  Cool feature on the camera very useful. And it can shoot high resolution video  Battery   lasts a while. I can get 6 hours wifi on heavy use but if the brightness is at 100 you lose some up time. And if yiu get a replacement battery you can just switch it out bam.  Cons  Camera isn't highest quality. Kinda grainy.  Not waterproof/Water resistant. Thats how my broke. Not broke but it's messed up pretty bad.   Price. Depending on what color you get this can go up to be 300 dollars, them Amazon vendors tryna rip y'all off this a $200/$250 Phone don't be rash wait till the price go down.  Front facing camera is not that great either but you can see so its not complete trash.  Too much stuff. Too many apps pulling on the ram makes it studder occasionally. Not bad but you'll notice it.   5 inches. I came from 4.7 in, i though well .3 in isn't that big of a jump but I was wrong, sometimes I have difficulty reaching the top of the screen to pull down my notification thing. Not the phone fault my hands just wasn't  for 5 in.   Micro sim. I had a regular sim. But its alright T-Mobile switch it and gave me a new one free.  I lied at the start. You should buy this if you think it's cool"
"The first unit I received had been used.  You could tell because there were smudges on the surface and what looked like bits of plastic on the sides.  I contacted Mogix because I was concerned that it had been a returned product and within a day they had shipped me a new one, no charge and even let me keep the first one!  Customer service could not have been nicer and continued to check that I had received my new unit and was satisfied.  After dealing with under-performing customer service reps before, this was a pleasant surprise.  AND I love my Mogix charger.  It works perfectly."
"loving them , I got the black one also ."
Love this case. Easy to clean. Withstands many falls to the floor.<br />The flip-open option is neat but also needed to use with my accessories.
Not any better than the one l already had and they come with no charge what so ever
does the job - worth it
"Got this case a few months ago, It works great. The kickstand is also a plus!"
"I do not normally review products and I can never seem to be happy with a case but this case is AWESOME! Very thin and minimal but protects well, has the buttons built into the case, and the clear back shows off the phone well. For $10 you can't go wrong."
I am very pleased with my Pyle Rear View camera. I did buy the wireless sending unit which made installing it a lot simpler by not having to fish wires from back to the front of my  a van. Also the camera was easier to adjust. Only one small hole to drill and camera mounted on license plate. works very well.
Fits the Samsung 4S edge perfectly.  Hold the phone really tight.  My daughter doesn't like to carry a bag and this cover has enough space for her cards and cash.  The colors are very classy.
"To  one  who's old enough to remember the absurd cost of overseas plug adaptors and the hefty size and weight of the old converters a few years ago,  this  tiny converter with its array of outlet adapters seems almost miraculous.  The converter is about 2&#34; square and can convert from 100 to 240 volts.  It has &#34;smart technology&#34; so that your devices charge rapidly and don't overcharge.<br /><br />Many people assume that (in this day of easy international travel) electricity would be standardized.  It probably should be, but it isn't.  Outlets in the US, the UK, the European Union, and in Australia all take different plugs.  Without the appropriate plug adapter, you might as well be staying someplace with no electricity.<br /><br />Also, US electronics run on 100-110 volts and outlets in other parts of the world supply 220-240 volts.  You MUST have a converter or you'll fry your phone. This converter has two USB ports.  It will handle phones and other electronics, but won't work for hairdryers, irons, etc.<br /><br />With this set, you simply choose the adapter that fits the outlet and attach it to the converter and plug it in.  The adapters even have nice &#34;pebbled&#34; sides, making them easy to insert and remove. That's a great feature, given the variety of outlet conditions you'll run into. You will probably never be carrying more than two adapters and the bag is roomy, so you can stick your cables in it.<br /><br />****** I was given a free sample of this product.  The seller offered nothing but a sample and asked for nothing but an honest opinion.****  My brother-in-law traveled to Germany this summer and the adapter/converters he used (loaners) were more expensive than this set and heavier, bulkier, and more difficult to use.  These are well-made and well-designed.  At the current price, they are a HUGE bargain.  Allow two weeks for delivery."
good quaility
Great product! My second one !
"Very good protector, awesome dropped it and nothing man not even a scratch and it was dropped on gravel, although the no fingerprint feature isnt the best, its hard to get finger smudges off, but other than that best glass ever."
Don't have options for languages
"I had to upgrade my car mount to fit my iPhone 6. I did some research and came across this and it had about 2000 review with 4 stars. It is not common on Amazon to see that many good reviews for a specific product.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- The suction cup is very good and basically works everywhere on my dashboard. I see that some people had an issue of the suction cup leaving a mark on there dash board but mine didn't even after leaving my car in direct sunlight for some time.<br />- There are many ways you can put it and it allows for adjustments to your liking.<br />-Fits many phones with no problem.<br />-Easy mechanism to attach and remove your phone, which I really like.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Feels cheap but I can't complain to much considering that I have purchased more expensive mounts that broke.<br />-The adjustment knob gets itself loose after a few bumpy rides. This is annoying because I constantly have to adjust it while driving.<br /><br />Over all it's is a great product and I have been using it for quite a few months now with no major issues."
This cover is amazing. It lasted with for about a year and it protected the phone so much. Love it . Great for the price.
"I would never use anything other than Zeiss on my lenses.  I have used other products and they produce and attract lint, smudge more easily, etc.  Zeiss is the best for me."
"Fits perfectly, and the instruction were easy to follow. Got the film on within 5 minutes."
"I've put several screen protectors on cells phones over the years and none have turned out well except these.  So far this screen cover is taking a licking and is protecting my LG screen wonderfully.  The sheet was easy to apply and I had no problems.  With the sheets you also get a lens cloth and scrapper.  The instructions are clear.  For the price you just cannot beat it.  Coupled with the ASHIELD Protective Case and Holster (Gray/Orange), I am confident my phone can withstand the normally brutal handling I typically inflict upon my phones."
"Lightweight, attractive, solid, convenient -- and it works! This is exactly what I was looking for to charge my Moto X."
Good. I like the corner bumpers. Easy to hold. Good protection when dropped.
Has only been a month and a half and product is not working. Very disappointed especially when you're expecting a quality purchase.  UPDATE:  Update. As soon as I left my review I was contacted by Anker. They were very helpful and I received a new iPhone 6 cord to replace the defected one. Customer serve is great and they truly fixed this issue in a hurry
I am now able to charge all devises in one location. Also like the fact that it sits flat on table with a cord to plug in.
This is a very good card and is appropriately priced. I have several games storied in one convent place.
Protects the screen.
Is very high quality and looks exactly like photo!!
it's okay!
"Great Case, I've dropped my phone more times then I can count and this case saves it every time, Very Sturdy and strong case, holds fine except if you start running be aware whenever you do a little run to your car while it's raining etc cause it might slip out of place"
"Works great, fits snug!"
"Wow, now have a phone without contract and it works great."
good charger but the cord is too short
"This is a pretty awesome case.  Wasn't expecting much, but can find anything bad to say about it.  Not only is it a solid case, it's screen protectors aren't bad at all.  The Note 5 is pretty light and feels pretty fragile, but this adds just the right amount of weight to make it feel solid.  Comes with nice little extras.  Two protectors, one for front and one for back.  The one for the back is to stop the rainbow effect because the back is glass.  I also think it would help if any dirt or grit gets behind the case. The case also comes with a little film on the front and back of the case to protect it during shipping.  Again just a little thing to is nice.  Also the dust caps for the charger port and headphone jack fit nice and tight.  If you are looking for a good case, this one is worth well more than they are charging."
Bought for my stepdad. He loves it. Fits great. Great protection.
I love these cases because I can create my own case.  I just insert a design on paper in between my phone and the clear case.  I change this up every now and then when I want something new.
"High end is tinny and distorted, likely a side effect of Bluetooth audio compression.<br />When running better quality audio through the AUX input, the sound quality improves dramatically.<br />However, the speaker just does NOT get loud enough.<br />The rubber texture picks up and holds on to dust and dirt.<br /><br />Got mine on sale at a box store for $40, and returned it the next day. Certainly would NOT pay $100 for it."
I am truly satisfied with my new iPhone case
Wont work for my smartphone. Returned immediately!
"It works well, and I like this. It makes for me to handle easily in the car."
"I love it! It was so easy to apply and you wouldn't even know there's a screen protector on it. I didn't even mess up on the first try (it comes with 3 sheets, so I have the other 2 for a far future). You may see some bubbles when you first apply it, but when you remove the top film (layer #2), the bubbles are gone! You hardly ever get smudges, and if you do, just blow out some of your breath on it, rub it with a soft cloth or your shirt and voila! Very sleek."
"says it has magnetic closure, it does not !  and Gmyle says it does not come with magnetic closure,so if you want the cover to stay closed don't buy this one."
Awesome
Work great.
Love the watch.....
I love it.
"Just received it and love it, it has the feel of an otterbox. So far its getting a five star rating. Will update again after a couple weeks but I believe its gonna hold up to drops, and the style is awesome."
"The case fits over the camera, but it becomes very difficult to use the buttons at the top of the camera. The power button and the the button to open the flash are very hard.  Not taking the buttons into account, the flash was able to open and functioned properly.  On a side note, if you use this case, the camera will fit inside the leather strap case designed for this camera, but that case will not close with this case on the camera.  I ended up not using the case as it was a pain to turn the camera on and off."
My grandson loves it.
"i've only used this cable for a couple of days but so far it works great, no problems"
"Dead after 5 months, barely used. Can't get in touch with anyone about warranty."
Thinner than the original but so comfy and love the color exactly as it looks in picture. Nice soft silicone bought this color and two in green so far.
Three words ... Best case ever. Or these three would work too ... I love it!
I love this watch and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for connectivity on the Android platform.  It is a little bigger than a regular watch but my regular watch doesn't show me emails and texts so it is definitely a fair trade-off.  I would buy this watch again.
"best quality, best service period.  order from them, you will be glad you did!"
Useless. It does not protect your privacy unless you have the screen completely dim making it hard to use.
Very Chic
I love it no problems no complaints.
Great price and works.
"well made, very secure.  S5 mini fits perfectly"
Works perfect! Will buy another 1.
Works great for my Note 4
"This is a great screen protector that is easy to transfer from packaging to phone screen. This protects my phone screen as if it is a 10 on the Moh's scale, but retains its sensitivity."
"Excellent addition to my alcatel one touch pop 7 ,,, case is attractive and we'll made, the keyboard works great with my tablet .. this product brings my tablet to a new level"
"Great ziplock bag, it did what I expected to do, take some underwater video and pics. one of the previous reviews said something about inserting a folded paper towel inside in case water gets inside the bag, it came in handy, after a few hours water leaked in but collected in the paper towel. Make sure when is re used is completely dry. Used an LG phone."
"I love this device. Easy to setup , and always on. When I get into my car , my phone connects to it right away. I have no problem controlling my phone with it either. This is a must have for cars that don't have Bluetooth audio connection in the car."
I love this case! I am easily able to slide my cards in and out.
"I love this case, it is gorgeous. Lightweight, love the grip, and good protection. The case works great against scratches. It worth the every penny, if you treat your phone like a phone, you won't need any other case. Highly recommended.<br />I got this product at discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
perfect
"I'm enjoying the simplicity of not having to plug my phone in to charge it. I wish the directions on hooking up induction device into my Samsung S4 would have been more detailed. I'm a technician and it stumped me for.a while, but, I was able to figure it out. I'm sure some person without my experience would not have been so fortunate.<br />I'm not complaining."
"Thought I'd use this adapter to switch between my iphone 5s and my Oneplus One device. Big problem since first of all this adapter has this little piece of adhesive on it which is not particularly strong. So once I inserted it properly onto the micro-sim tray slot for my Oneplus one, it first of all did not read the sim card at all. When I tried to eject it, the sim card tray ejected with the actual sim card (with a nasty scratch on it), but the sim card adapter was left stuck in the phone. I took it to a repair shop and they told me that my Oneplus device is now inoperable as a phone thanks to the sim card adapter basically shredding all of the sim-card reading pins on the Oneplus mainboard. So now I'm left with a phone that'd be too expensive to repair, an adapter that doesn't work, and needing to get a replacement sim.<br /><br />Lesson learned is, DO NOT use this sim card adapter if you have a Oneplus One phone. And considering the repair shop I took it to said that he's seen this happen many times for other people, I would avoid using adapters at all if you can."
"I had some issues with my original unit but after seeing my old review they sent me a new one at no cost. The new one works great on all my devices. Completely satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it. Below is my old review for the defective product they promtely replaced.<br /><br />&#34;It's Decent but not compatible with everything. It worked okay with my Samsung but not my Sony.<br /><br />Since it uses the USB and it's IQ adaptive system it doesn't work with a lot of phone docks like Sony which charges by a magnetic strip. Since there are no ports that are not part of the IQ system there is no way to get Sony products to work with this using the Magnetic Charger.<br /><br />Second. I haven't owned this that long and all ready I have had some ports malfunction. The top port for example does not always work, You plug something into it and nothing happens no charging at all.&#34;"
"Makes a difference !, I own an iPhone 5s and it fits perfectly, came packaged with care. Well worth the money. I would highly recommend"
The best service and best quality
Great little set up.  Does what it is advertised to do.
Good product
"Perfect for &#34;no pockets&#34; outfits and outdoor activities, really is waterproof!"
Great product! As advertised
loved it
Very Cute case
Life saver was on a cross country flight 3+ hours and forgot to charge my iPhone before take off.  I was able to plug this in a 5% and it brought it to a full charge and kept it charged until we landed. Holds it internal charge for a good time as well my flight was on a Friday and I charged it the Friday before and was still fully charged.<br /><br />Highly recommend this goes on all my trips with me now. Will be picking up a second one to keep in my backpack for work.
Great Case for the price!!!
The stones keep coming off
Didn't fit my phone
The best case ever
I received these in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />They arrived promptly and as described.<br /><br />This charging system arrived in easy to open packaging and was simple to assemble.  My IPhone 6 didn't have a problem connecting and charging with this cable.  They are thicker than some of the less expensive models I've owned in the past.  Love it and would recommend it to anyone.
fits with case on IPhone 6plus
"very loud for its size... I work in a factory plant where its loud ... there is a lot of fork lift traffic so having earphones is very dangerous because you can not hear them coming or honking.... so the fact that you can just hang this on your belt loop, you can keep your ears wide open to hear anything and in the mean while enjoy your music"
Cheap material. Less than 2 weeks it broke
I have used these on my phones for approximately 4 years and I recommend them for protecting your phone screens. They do not affect the touch control.
"I was skeptical about this product at first and spent weeks comparing phone similar stands and I kept coming back to this one.  I was looking for something that would sit on my desk at work, between my monitors, and not obstruct my view.  I wanted my iPhone 6 plus to sit in the landscape/horizontal position so I could have it charging, hook up headphones to listening to music, adjustable viewing angle, and not have it laying down flat on my desk.<br /><br />This stand is very solid and appears to be made of aluminum.  There is silicone padding on the bottom of the stand and as well as where you device rests on.  There are 3 rivets holding this thing together.  One for the swivel and 2 for the tilting portion of the stand.  They are very tight and I haven't had any issues with them so far.<br /><br />I'm very happy with the stand, and for the price, I was willing to take a chance and it paid off.<br /><br />On a side note.  My iPhone doesn't have a case on it so I can't speak to how a particular case would work with this stand.  Also, I haven't tried it with tablets yet.  I'll update this review once/if I do."
good protection
Does the job and charged really fast
Two of the three cables failed to function within one month.  Not recommended.
"Tech Armor<br />Easy to apply, clear, no bubbles, no hassle. Let the protection begin."
"SORRY WRONG PRODUCT. HEEDED MOTO G, CASE."
Very uncomfortable and sub par sound.
"Nice case if you are looking for clear protection for your iPhone, this case does it's job very well and it looks good while giving you more than enough protection for the average user. I have been demo-ing NewTrent cases over the last six months and they never disappoint, great build quality and very little bulk. This case is a steal at this price and it does it's job well, very well!"
Best screen protector for the price. Has saved my phone more than once!
A nice slim cover for the price.  I haven't damaged my iPhone 6plus yet and really don't expect to with this simple and clean phone cover.
Beautiful case..loved it. And arrived on time. Reason I gave it 4 stars is the fact that it's only available for a s6 edge. I ordered this not paying attention....I know my fault but it was so cute. Got to say my galaxy s6 fits in there and doesn't feel lose at all. Only the buttons do not match with the holes but still able to function good. Definitely true to the picture colors and all.
"Amazing amp for the money.  Originally had it hooked up to the shallow 10&#34; pioneer sub, now I'm running a JL 13w6 and it still powers it like a champ.  Haven't had any problems what so ever."
This is a great case!  It's arrived quickly and is made very well...seems solid!
Good screen protector!
very well made and super strong
A+++!!! Epic seller!!!
"Works great on Miata, Acura RDX, and PT Cruiser, with various versions of iPhones.  I use it ever day and it's showing no sign of falling apart."
AWESOME  only need LEDs to show solid connection for each port
"I know styli can go from really cheap to really expensive quickly.  Frankly, these are cheap but they don't have the latency that I've seen in more expensive one.  For that reason and the price, I give them 5 stars.  They outperform more expensive models and if I burn through 18 of these (I bought 2 packs), I'll just buy more."
"The cord is nice and long, the issue is that the micro usb portion does not make a great connection within my products.  Basically the hardware doesn't fit and thus does not charge either my phone or Kindle unless I push down on the cord while it is plugged in.  For me this was a waste of money."
Love it easy to use
This is my second purchase of this product. I bought this for my Samsung Galaxy S4. I accidently dropped my phone face down on concrete and several other times without anything cracking. The first break to this glass cover was a direct hit from the corner of a cement counter top. It hit the top edge and made a chip in the cover. I left it in place because it was minor damage and barely noticeable. This did compromise the integrity of the screen protector and I did get several more cracks in it over the next 3 months from more drops/bangs. I finally decided it had too many cracks and needed replaced so I bought another one. Installation is a breeze and the fit is great. I like how shiny it is. Much cheaper than repairing a phone or replacing the cracked screen. I highly recommend this product.
"It is Ok, but I thought it will be better...the mirror is very, very useful but the stick...the way of open it and close it is not the best one..."
Very easy to put on camera!  Love it!
great one i like it
"I measured my wrist at just under 6&#34; and the small was a little snug when I got it but loosened a little bit after a few weeks. The heart rate monitor built into some of the newer models would be nice, but at prices over $100 I can't afford them. The UP24 is great for my purposes (silent alarm, tracking sleep, counting steps) and at around $40 it's definitely well worth the price.  A tip, I didn't realize for the first 2 or so weeks that I used the UP24 that you can calibrate your band so it better calculates the distance you're walking. I have a fairly long stride for my height so on a 5km walk the app was only registering about 4km travelled. To calibrate your band: 1. Do a walk or run in stopwatch mode - short press once then long press the button on the band until the sun blinks.   It helps to have an alternative app running to map your distance (Map my run, Nike+) or to just calculate it later on Google Maps 2. Long press the button to end the workout 3. Tap the little white band icon in the top right corner of the app 4. Tap the black and white band icon in the top right corner of the open menu (next to YOUR NAME Up24) 5. Choose the calibrate option in the center and follow the on-screen instructions"
Very nice phone case. Great quality and durable without being too bulky.  The reason why I gave it 4/5 is because I have a huge problem with the buttons. Its really hard to take screenshots & control the volume. Really irritating. I honestly don't think I'll be buying another one for this reason.
"Great protective case, cheaper than life proof, have used case for under water photos and just in the shower.  Slight loss of touch screen sensitivity but not enough to complain about"
NICE BUT I THOUGHT i WAS RECEIVING 2 INSTEAD OF ONE
good
"You can never have too many USB cables... and with different lengths this is an awesome pack. We used the longer cable in the car, the rest are used to charge a bunch of tablets and phones."
I love it and everyone that see it wants one.
As advertised.
"I've been using this lightning cable at work for the last week and love it. I sit in a cubicle and am always trying to keep my surface area clean. The design of this flat cable allows me to run the cable up the back wall and easily clip it into place to keep it organized. The cable works perfectly for charging your iphone and ipad. Quality is very good, I highly recommend it."
"only down side is the position of the adjuster button on the backside hits the vent and opens the adjustable arms so that my phone is no longer tightly fitting.  This happens due to the heavy weight of my phone with it's case (samsung note 2).  I just have to keep an eye on it and be aware not to let it rest on the vent so it hits the button, kinda a pain, but other than that it's working great so far"
After receiving the armband I could see automatically that it was not up to my expectations. it was made out of flimsly material. When you put your phone in it and tried to use key pad of your phone it was impossible. The plastic covering that part of the phone once again was junk! Too bad! You get what you pay for! To use the phone you have to take it out of the arm band. PAIN!
Give quick fair review and you can get best deal. happy happy.
Excellent device!
To thick
Works great!  The little vibration instantly reminds me not to slouch.  Love it!! This is going to be my holiday gift for loved ones this year.  Soooooo cool!
Beautifully engineered and does the job very well
Looks and sounds great will try it.
"I was tempted to give this a lower rating simply because of the nauseating smell when first opened, but it is getting better with time. (HOPEFULLY it will disappear altogether!) My phone fits perfectly and the arm band is comfortable. I was at an event this past weekend and didn't want to carry a purse so I used this to hole my phone, ID and some cash and just strapped it to my calf (hidden by capris) There is even a spot to hide a key and this trumped the smell. It doesn't look like it would fit small arms. Overall great product!"
Was as described and shipped quickly
Works as advertised but it does not accomodate very large batteries like the Posh 7&#34; phone has.  Very good deal for the $5 tag.
perfect condition<br />Thank You!
The case fits perfectly on my Son's phone. Thanks for the fast shipment of the order.
There is nothing better to mount an escort/bel detector. Rock solid.
Recived cheap knock off instead of Verizon Oem.
"nice and small,"
Nice they worked great~A+
For the rather unusual reason that a average consumer would purchase a &#34;fake&#34; IPhone is completely on you.  The phone looks and feels the same. As my iPhone 5s. Like many others I have a &#34;little thief&#34; that likes to take my phone. So now I just give them the fake phone and they're amused for hours. 10/10 would possibly recommend
"I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 with Android version 4.4.2. It states the Bluetooth works with Android version 4.2.2 and above and mine works perfectly with it. When I was contacted by the company to receive this item for my honest review the first thing I did was make sure my Android version would work.<br /><br />This is my first selfie stick. First I put on the included USB charger but it was actually already completely charged. It's 7 1/2&#34; long closed and about 30&#34; fully extended. By pressing the Bluetooth button on the end (where the logo &#34;gogogu&#34; is) it paired easily with my phone; it shows up as Z07-5 on my phone and shows the message &#34;bluetooth keyboard connected&#34; when paired.<br /><br />I extended the stick, put my phone in the slot and used the thumb screw to tighten it so it would stay. Then I started taking selfies by pressing the Bluetooth button; it was that easy. I know you don't want to see selfies of me (I don't blame you; I don't either), so I'm posting a couple selfies that Mickey & Minnie took (with a little help from their friend). What a fun device!  :-)"
"Very strong, sturdy and protective! It has the phone completely sealed from any dirt and debris from getting in!"
"Bought two of these, one for each car - I love that I have so many options and that it securely holds my Note 4 with a heavy duty case!  One of the vent clips did break about a week after Amazon's return window was up...contacted the company and received a replacement part in less than a week with no hassle of having to send anything back."
great product and customer service!! will buy from again
great one i like it
we have had someone messing around our back yard. so we got this camera to find out who it was. and it worked perfect. the first night we caught them. they are now in jail.
nice
"Delivery of case was sooner than promised! Case is very sturdy and tough, versatile too."
The company have a good customer service. I revived the item as described.
"Quickly charges 2 iPhone 6 + simultaneously, much faster than 1 iPhone 6 +, which uses the Apple charger.  Would have been even more valuable if it included Euro adapter."
Nice and thin yet protective.
good
"Good deal, bought it for my grand daughter she likes it and so cheap.."

"This is not a very good purchase it took over a month to get here. It makes it so you have a hard time hearing people as well as them hearing you, also we tested it without the phone in it for water proof and of coarse water pours in. Don't buy just a waste of time. Only good thing it was cheap."
My favorite headphones! These earbuds have amazing high and low end and the range of the Bluetooth connection is impressive for their price.
so happy to find something that fits my blu win hd. It matches my phone and the material both the yellow silicone and grey plastic are soft to the touch. I would say that using this case is a pleasant tactile experience.
"This watch is very nice. It is a show off watch, but if you want something fancy do not get it because it is more of the every day type in a fancy restaurant type."
Yes it did thank you
Love it
Makes driving an ease when using GPS which is why I purchased this for my son. He just got his license and I wanted him to be able to see the GPS without looking down at his phone.  He tells me he could really feel the difference from a safety perspective.  Yay for mom!
Pretty much the perfect cell phone mount for the car. My only complaint is that the &#34;jaw&#34; covers the volume and power button on the Z3C (not a knock against the design otherwise).<br /><br />The knob on the back of the swing arm also seems to come loose easily. But for the price paid it is a small concern.
Very good! I bought one for each of my cars.
like the way it is able to be attached vertical or horizontal... handy that the air from the vent keeps the phone cool --
"My original Sony Ericsson Live with Walkman WT19i bought in 2011 was stolen, so I was ecstatic when I found this still on sale in 2014. Even if this one is fake, I'm still very happy that it's available for purchase, because I fall in love with this model back in 2011 and this phone is still quite enough for me even in 2015. The only problem is battery. It charges really fast, unrealistically fast I'd say. But runs down fast as well. Though maybe it's just me and other people might not have the same problem. Maybe it's not even a problem. My brother says that the original phone had this and I simply don't remember that. Anyway, the phone itself is great. Or was great back in his time. Its price justified its quality."
Perfect high quality and beefier cord than the thin wire that comes with apple devices. i would certainly recommend this cord to anyone. it works with iphone5 and ipad air for charging.
love it
Worked as expected.
Very nice for the price. Has good sound and can be very loud.
I'm very happy with this.  I got tired of all the cables laying around.  This cleans up the clutter and they work great.
"Like it, love it!"
Product just as advertised. Great merchant
"Bought two of these maybe a month ago because all the other ones I had bought before them had fallen apart. Figured if I bought two I'd have a backup for when the next one breaks.  I am happy to report that now, one month later, it is still working! Who knows for how much longer though lol"
Do not buy
Absolutely a great product and cost way below product quality. I love it!
"I've only used it once. Seems to work very well. So far, so good."
Nice picture but a flimsy material. Just for looks.
It is a good screen protector but in a week it cracked a little from the corners and the second time I dropped my phone it created a line in the middle.
"Not that same as the knobs that come with the original HDS7, but they work."
My wife loves these on her iPads.  She uses them for all three iPads she has.
Good quality and fits the Galaxy Express perfect. My son loves it.
Is very good it was a gift to my nice she love it ! Thanks
An excellent auxiliary cord that doesn't crackle when moved around. Very pleased with this purchase. Extremely pleased with the price considering I paid about $15 at a retailer for another cord in my wife's car. Highly recommend this product
too cool with this gadget
"Good product ,so far happy"
"Just so happy with this case. I've only ever bought one other case, but it wasn't as great as this one. I drop my phone regularly and it just bounces, unscathed. The kickstand is handy."
"Sound and bass is awesome. Most comfortable headphones hands down. It's doesn't even feel like I have headphones on they not only fit around your ears perfectly but inside too,  they are slanted perfectly to fit inside your ear so the buds don't pop out like other headphones. They also look super nice. Best headphones I ever owned out of the hundreds I had."
This is THE best one I have come across and the built in aux cord is thick and sturdy. Great quality and the buttons to control the tunes are of good quality as well. The sound is no different then sliding in a store bought CD. Puts off the perfect amount of treble and bass.
"After two days, cables seem well made and charge iPhone 5, 6, and iPad mini with no issues"
Excellent product.
"I had never owned a battery case so I was very curious to how I would like it.  When it arrived I was very pleasantly surprised.  It is very easy to install in the case, very easy.  It fit my iPone 6 Plus perfectly. It adds some weight, which I expected, but not so much weight as to make the phone difficult to carry in my front pants pocket. I'm sitting here looking at the battery case, holding it in my hand and I honestly can't find anything wrong with it, it fits my needs perfectly.  The availability of the extra better charge has already come in more handy that I had anticipated. You will like the robust nature of its manufacture (its well made), the ease of use, and the appearance. Well worth the purchase!!"
"This case is perfect.  Very thin, very flexible and soft.  The clear one shows off the Note 5 very well.  Provides secure grip.  The phone is very slippery without a case.  It would probably slip out of my hands without this case.  The S Pen is easy to grab with this case."
Been using this for a while now.  Still works great.  It's small and fits really well.
Fdo
Better than expected!
Exactly what I needed for long days and nights out of the office!
"Very low volume, ear pieces are tiny.  Whole headwrap is small, but so is my headsize - so hard to say. You get what you pay for - this is the cheapest bluetooth headset out there. It works, but it doesn't sound great."
The ear piece receives ok but the other person cannot hear too well due to low volume. I would have to be almost yelling for people to hear me. I would not recommend this for any professionals.
Good product
I've had this headset for a few weeks now and I love it! Great range. So much better than a previous high-end brand I had and returned. Earbuds occasionally fall out but I've found If I just turn them the stay in perfectly.
"Now my band stats in , finally!!!!"
"This little stand is so handy! I look up recipes a lot on my phone and refer to them in the kitchen. I am constantly having to wash my hands and pick up my phone to read/view what to do next. With this little stand, I can sinply attach my phone and put the stand on my counter. I do not worry at all that my phone will fall. The suction is very reliable and strong. The pieces were very easy to assemble and stay together well. I have also found my son using this to put his ipod on while he watches videos. This is a nice little device to have around. I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange of an honest review."
"Didn't pair or work right, took it in to best buy for help no luck  sent it back"
great
"I have had no problems with this case and recommend it highly.  It fits great and protects well enough that falling off a car roof at 25mph and tumbling on the road a bit did not cause any damage to my, er, my friend's phone.  Yeah, that's it.  My friend."
"This is a great item.  I use my phone as a scanner.  It usually goes down very quickly.  I can attach this and it charges the phone back up.  It is remarkable for such a small, inexpensive item."
Works great in fact I'm buying another one.
Everything is fine. I love Amazon
works fine
This phone is a piece of s***. It freezes often making it unusable. I used mine for about a few days now and I was so mad that I threw it against the wall.
Was fine
This case is the best and very durable.
"Fast shipping,  good pricing, and exactly what i needed."
Didn't last. The cheap ones sold at Target for $5.00  last way longer.
Case is slim and provides enough protection
Great my son loves his new case
"Love this case!!  I didn't know the leg of the cup also served as a stand,  I glued it because it seemed weak and my phone is heavy and I did not want it to break. But it is such a cute case! For a great price. 👍"
Seems good only problem so far it is a tight fit and therefore difficult to get off. At least I will not lose it!
bought 3 or 4 the the kids they and i are enjoying
"This is a great phone mount for road bike. I researched many options, and I really appreciate the flexibility of phone size. I have an iPhone 5s in an otter box case. It locks in with no problems."
"Great instructions, easy to install with the alcohol cleaner, dust removal, etc. for two glass screen applications. Thought it's a great product at a great price. Best thing is that the glass doesn't negatively impact the touch sensitivity!"
So far so good.
love the case. The colors are very cute just not as neon as in the pics but still very close. I got them today so if theres any bad reviews in the future I will just let everyone know! :)
Good as otterbox
Great!
"This product is very well quality, it's thin, but durable as well. My case actually arrived a lot sooner than the expected date was (almost 2 or 3 weeks early) and the customer service of this provider is outstanding."
"Cable does everything as intended. Only issue for me is the &#34;TA&#34; logo brushed off within a day of usage, so if you like the Tech Armor logo, I'm sorry."
Good stand...and adjustable too!
This is my 3rd try to find a good case for my Galaxy S5 and it is has met my needs and expectations.  Wow!<br />I really like it.
I love it!
"Good soft/hard case. This case has 2 layers, one semi-hard rubber case and on top of that a hard plastic case. It has a very sleek design and provides good protection.  I received this product in exchange for my honest unbiased review."
They would not charge iphone 6 and iPad 4
This is beyond a great case for your iPhone protection. I got my iPhone less than a month. I left the phone on the roof of my car and drove away at about 55 mph. My phone flew off and landed on the side of the road and this case did an amazing job protecting my phone. There are only scratches around the case corners and nothing happened to my phone. Thank you Spigen.
I was able to put this screen protector on myself. In the past I had the phone company put it on the new phone. This one was so easy and no bubbles. Just clean the phone with the solution and cloth in the package and line it up on the phone.
"First and foremost I received this case at a discount to give an unbiased review on. Upon first look the case is sleek and feels of a fairly good quality. It fits the phone very well and is very comfortable while being worn on the hip. Due to the size of the case it could be caught on something while being worn from the hip so be careful of that, not to say the case is overly large but it does house a large phone. The case feels firmly secured when closed unlike other cases I've used in the past. All in all it is a terrific case especially for the money. I am very pleased with it."
"I have been using this charger for several months. I've set up a charging table where my family of four and guests routinely plug in iPhones. an iPad, androids, and various bluetooth devises and rechargeable speakers. The Anker PowerPort has performed flawlessly whether one or 6 products have been plugged in for charging."
"Definitely a time saver when charging your device, or just needing your phone's micro USB for something else. The only downfall I have had with this, which isn't a fault of the device, is you need to position the device almost perfectly for it to charge. There is a (blue) charging indicator light that goes around the entire front of the device; it changes green when you're at 100%. Very convenient for travel as well."
"Bought this for music in my car.  For the price, I couldn't be more satisified.  My phone connects automatically every time I get in the car and the audio sounds pretty good (for an aftermarket bluetooth adapter).<br /><br />4/5 because the phone feature on this is terrible - I had to stop making calls on it immediately because people complained they could not hear me.<br /><br />If you're buying it for music, I highly recommend."
the cover does not close completely around my telphone.
These seem solid and work well so far.
Connected my entire downstairs to this which in turn is connected to a Sonos Connect.Amp.  Perfect sound through out the entire house.  Enabled me to hook everything up for a moderate cost.  I also love the ability to deselect speakers from the front.  I also didn't notice a difference in sound.  Great product.<br /><br />Super easy to setup.
"Keep Looking Elsewhere, the Kick Stand didnt last but 2 weeks and barely used it before breaking other than that same as most of the other $15 cases on Amazon."
"I had originally given this product a very positive review, after buying it in July 2015.<br />But unfortunately by November 2015 the device simply died. It had always fed the same two Nexus 7 tablets, which are still alive and well, except it doesn't charge them anymore, nor does the blue &#34;On&#34; light turn on, as if some (inaccessible) internal fuse has blown.<br />BTW the plane's voltage is monitored carefully, and even logged for each flight, and it's always around 27.5v.<br />When you click on &#34;warranty info&#34; for this product on the Amazon site, you get a message &#34;see manufacturer's website&#34;, and on that site I have been unable to find any useful warranty service info.<br />So as bottom line, assuming my experience is typical, this device may work for a while and then die a few months later, with no obvious way to get warranty service.<br />Buyer beware!"
Protects my iphone 6 from falls and my toddler! Great product
"Charges my phone to 100% Couldn't do without it! Only issue I'm having is that pin charger will not always connect. Otherwise, when it fully charged the phone, it's great!"
great product
"It's been one year, and it's broken. It no longer holds a charge."
Package arrived on time and product serves it's intended use.
Just perfect!!
Great product...and comes in 6-pak!
Did not work for calls. Wish i had not brought from them
Everything you need to replace the ear speaker and headphone jack on a Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The repair was quick and easy. Thankful for this kit so that I didn't have to buy a new phone! It's well worth the $10!
I had a little feedback on the phones that I ship to members of the family and this phone was very very good they loved it no bad complain Thanks
Very durable and easy to put on! The best part is no bubbles!! I also love that my fingers don't leave smudges on my screen anymore!! Very worth it! And hey you can't beat this low price! I highly recommend this!
"Love it, doesn't add a lot of bulk to the phone compared to other otter box cases. The pink exactly matches the pink iPhone 5c. The grey on it looks great too. Was easy to install"
I love how long this cable is it is way longer than the cable apple provides you with the iphone and ipad and its cheeper but its still a good quality cable. If you need a longer lightning to usb cable I highly recommend this one.
"It works great.  However, it is not the easiest thing to put on.  It takes patience and pretty much a dust-free environment, but once you get it on, it is great for protecting your screen."
good
veryyyyyyyyyy nice case
Very good phone . The best prices and especificaciones.-
"Awful!  Not really iPhone Apple product.  Cheap, light weight and barely work."
I love this phone charger. It works beautifully.  You can attach phone in your bag and in a matter of time your phone is charged.. it was worth the money spent.
Broken before used.
The pizza decal is bubbling and the pink part broke off on day 1.
Very durable products
"I purchased the MAXX Case from iThrough when my husband and I got new phones. Having previously had covers similar to this, I knew we would like them. We also knew we wanted a kickstand because we had one before & loved it. They are so convenient. The case fits very snugly which is GOOD because I had a case that didn't and eventually it would come off and I'd have to put it back on. I like my case. I had never had a white case before and probably won't get one again simply because it go dirty so quickly. I got the blue one for my husband and his doesn't look dirty at all. I solved the problem by simply taking it off and washing it. Since it is removable, that is fine. The second piece is the black part which is where the kickstand is located. They look to be just as durable as the ones we had before and they lasted longer than the phones.<br /><br />Although I am a product tester / reviewer and test several products each week, I purchased this case on my own without a discount. No matter which way I'm buying products, I always pre-test each item and give my honest & unbiased opinion."
Came on time and my last one saved my phone so hoping this one does too :)
lifesaver
sturdy and easy to use.
Works well and a lot cheaper than the original Apple version.  Seems sturdier too.  But bear in mind it's a few inches shorter (36in vs 39in)
This works well in the car and it shipped very quick and was good price! Thanks my husband loves it!
It doesn't  fit  the  phone.
"Product is very slim, which is what I wanted. It doesn't add much to the original size of the phone.  Won't protect the screen much though if damaged."
"low price, high quality"
good
It doesn't protect enough of the phone.
Perfect for a computer desktop or gaming set up. Loud enough to fill a single room but not much larger than that
A great battery for a great phone. Some of us power users need more than the standard and this is perfect. There isn't a bigger battery on the market. A full charge will last you at least three days. It's going to take a couple charging cycles for the phone to recognize the battery fully and you won't have to panic and rush for a charger at one percent either. 1% of a 10000 mah battery is another 5 hrs. Just try not to constantly run the battery down to 0.
Just what I needed.
"I use this everyday in my truck.  It's easy to set up and use.  I had to purchase a ground loop noise isolator to eliminate the buzzing now it's 100% perfect.  No distortion, no loss of sound quality.  It plays from the point it was at when you stopped it which is nice.  It automatically connects to your phone when you turn your car on.  All you have to do is press play.  The phone quality is good as well as the caller on the other end states that they have no problem with hearing me clearly and they do not complain of any loud background road noise.  Hope this helps.  I would definitely purchase another one of these if this one stops working for some reason.  I use it with my Galaxy S5 active by the way."
"Just because there is no option for &#34;zero&#34; stars.<br /><br />Like so many others here, I mistakenly assumed that a product labeled &#34;Perfect For: MP3 Players/Portable DVD Players/Mobile Media Managers&#34; would actually be compatible with those products. Nothing, repeat, NOTHING that I have has a 2.5mm earphone receptacle. Now I'm stuck with this piece of crap, because returning it costs more than the refund."
"Works great, I charge my Android phone, iPad, Bluetooth headset all at once, all at full speed. Very convenient that it only uses one wall plug. Must buy if you have multiple mobile USB devices. Ontop of all that, it is made by anker, who has one of the best warranties and customer service in the industry."
Able to use the same number right away when switching from an old cell to an iPhone by modifying the existing SIM. Skipped the whole porting hassle.
So surprised by how good the sound is.  I was a little worried due to the low price but very happy with it and bought another one for my daughter.
Mine stopped working after a few weeks.  Amazon lost my return so I am out 10 bucks.  Stay away.
its ok
I am extremely pleased with this charger for the ease of use...no special spots to find.  What I love is the price.  This is far less expensive  than the phone store prices...now I can have upstairs/downstairs units.  The price is great for students and retirees.
Arrived faster then expected.  Works great while t the beach and while scuba diving and swimming
Awesome!
"Very good, not cheap material. Better music quality than my previous ones off of amazon."
"Works great for the note 2, havent had any problems so far. Also the phone mount can be used on other tripods, works great on my 5 foot tripod"
"This is such a nice cover, fits well and is secure to hold since has Matt finish.  Love the color, it's striking on the black phone!"
great design. instant performance boost over worn old chargers.  built in tech prevents overcharging damage to devices.  have not experienced any loss of charging with multiple devices connected 2 at a time. stays seated securely in car port without getting loose and holds charging cords good and tight .
Love it! Will buy this product again!
Great case. Easy to hold onto the phone. Attractive case.
"I have had this case for less then 5 months and both the plastic covering over the camera flash and the plastic covering over the main, circle button have torn. The clear plastic they put over those is very thin, almost like a Saran Wrap material, and not durable at all. This basically makes this case worthless when it comes to water protection and for the price I paid for it I expected at least a good year of use out of it."
"Very good and comfortable headphone. Sound quality to me sounds better than the Beats these replaced. Very good price, they don't feel cheap."
"Great product, have droped phone many times, great phone saver!!"
The left side headset stop working replacement
Very nice product did what it said.
This cover was part of a crazy phone covers phase that I had this week. Out of the four that I bought this one is my favorite. It easy to watch YouTube videos with the stand. It also had a futuristic look to it that I just like. I like the design and it protect well. It has hard plastic with a screen protector as well a a softer inner she'll. Recommend product.
Good phone protection. easy to clip on a belt. maybe a little too much velcro but that's an easy duct tape fix. just cover some of the area with a small patch.
Awesome product. i would totally recommend it!! Small speaker but with great sound quality. Radio works just fine.
Great price and just what I wanted. Fas shipping to boot!
"The cover looks used. There are so many scratches on the back of the cover. I am attaching the picture of it to let people know that the product is not the way its being advertised!!!<br />Total waste of my time and money,"
It works.
Does the job well. Great product for the price.
👌🏽
All 3 stopped working in the second week of use save your money.
Good headsets. Work well and hold a charge for a long time.
Excellent cover for the price
My son loves it
Excelente
Good quality and nice finish. Though its little bit heave for its material but good to have such a product. Kids will love to play with it.
Thank you!
Works great but it's really really big. Bigger than other batteries with comparable power stats.
Really good phone case.
Love it!!
Love it! Its amazing. Its heavy and keeps phone super secure!
I love this phone.  I have had it for almost a year and it works fabulously.  There have been no major problems.  Some time the camera loses focus during video.  But it is a great phone for the price.
A really nice looking cable that works great. I got if for my daughter. She loves the color blue. She used it for her Samsung s5. The cable has a nice feeling and a nice bright blue color. It looks like it will last a very long time.<br /><br />The USB cable is reinforce specially where cables tend to break easy. So that's a plus. It also works with the computer it syncs from computer to cellphone without any problem. Very well made it is durable and I know it will be in used for a very long time.<br /><br />I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.
"Looks nice, perfect size, good to have all other extras."
"Good unit at a good price. Multi layering of the rubber clamp inserts makes it adaptable almost ant handlebar diameter. Holds your phone rock solid and the rubber security net is a great addition. Put this on my Harley and have used it several times with no issues whatsoever. Only complaint is that the pinch bolt is WAY too long. I suppose it may be necessary for a wider diameter handlebar but for my application I could use one about 1/2 as long. For the price, an excellent buy."
Item worked perfectly! No problems at all.
"Arrived very quickly, color just as shown."
"I really loved this phone case,  but after 2 months it started falling apart.  The seem on the side split open,  so now I'm shopping for a new one.  I ordered the magenta."
These stopped working just 2 days after I received them. Very displeased.
wow this thing does the job !!!
"Good case, thanks!"
It was the wrong case.
I love it.  It looks professional and very well made.  I dropped my phone several times and watched it bounce with no problems.
"Sound quality is great...as long as you move slowly or your phone is on a flat surface. If you have your phone (I have an iPhone 5) in your pocket or in a holster clipped on your pants or in a purse and walk briskly or run, the sound breaks up. This is the second Bluetooth headset I've tried that has the same problem and the other pair was from a different manufacturer."
great one i like it
Works just as well as the one it replaced. Let's hope it lasts longer.
"Selfie stick works great, all you have to do is plug it into your phone & go. The only issue I had was with the packaging. The box was a little smashed and the only instructions for the device was on the back of the box in extremely small print. Luckily it was easy to figure out on my own. I purchased this product at a discount for my honest review."
"I love wooden cases and this is exactly what I look for. The only thing I would suggest improving is the fitting, maybe a small hook at the lower corners would improve."
Really nice color i order mint<br />Fits perfectly on my iPhone 6<br />Love the strap :)
"I have an old iphone 3gs that i plan to use it permanently as an ipod touch, in my mini cooper conv 2009.That particular<br />cable is the only one that makes my phone appears as an ipod at the central screen.It allows navigation through lists ,albums, artists<br />etc.Of course ,due to limitations of my mini's audio, this is quite an awkward way to explore ipod.<br />All in all, the cable does the job as expected. In comparison , several other adaptors for 3gs or 4, even for 5 or 6 iphones, they just pass the signal to aux ."
Still works after many years of use.  Not a top of the line product but it gets the job done and has provided years of good service (a little over 3 years so far)
"I've had four pair. The sound is excellent, and they fit my ear (few earbuds do). The problem I've had with every one is that despite all my best efforts, they all eventually shorted out. The weakness is in the cord where it leaves the plug. Normal wear and tear bending will ruin it in a few months. I've managed to make them last up to 6-7 months by wrapping that part of the cord in electrical tape, but it looks like crap and eventually fails anyway. After two years and $160+ (I got one store to replace a set without charge), I'm ditching the brand and looking elsewhere. Such great sound and a solid fit, but if they can't manage to engineer a cord that doesn't break, it's an expensive and useless gadget."
This is a great a product with enough power to charge multiple devises at the same time very fast yet using only one outlet. Very happy with my purchase
"I'm using this remote to control a DNX572BH (2015 Kenwood lineup).  Functionality is incredibly lacking compared to an older KVT719DVD (2007 Kenwood lineup) unit and remote that I have.  With my old unit and remote I can press 1 on the remote and it will take me to my radio preset number 1.  The new one, nope...On my old unit, while playing MP3, bluetooth, or any other media type, I can press next on the remote and it will move forward to the next track; my new one?  Nope.  All I can do with this remote is change the volume and scroll through radio stations. Apparently technology has regressed since 2007.  I am pissed off that I bought this remote and I'm wondering what the difference is between this remote that has been discontinued and the much pricier remote with the same model # that is still active."
"these were actually really nice the first week. then one of the rubber pieces fell out rendering the ear bud to hang lifeless because there is nothing holding it to the headset. then one of the speakers was always kinda weak but just stopped working after a few days. for the $25 i spent, I expected a little better product considering they are marketing it as older bluetooth. not used. i'm sadder now because now the other speaker is going out and these aren't a month old yet. ugh"
"These cords do NOT work. The charge light comes on initially, but immediately goes off. very disappointing."
Also got this for my wife. Doesn't feel as protected but it's light.  We'll see what happens haha.
Work great with my Samsung galaxy s6.
Fit just right and protects my screen great. Easy to install.
"I love the way that I can easily dial up a number and call without even using my hands. Device is very well designed and overall i'm pretty happy with it, if we also add the part that I got it for free so I could see if it was actually worth to buy. For me, it's a total must have"
"I work at a factory, operating fork trucks and tuggers, and I needed something to protect my phone in case of a drop. I believe I bought the right case for the job.<br /><br />About a day in using the product, my phone accidentally fell down the stairs in my home landing on the hardwood floor. It must have hit the steps around 3 or 4 times. Upon inspecting the phone, both case and phone were scuff free. What a relief.<br /><br />My only complaint with this case is my phone came with one of the glassy screen protectors, and the film on the case isn't plush with the screen. It makes it so little things can get into the hole where the home button is (like sand or dirt) and you have to be firm with your touch to get to the touch screen. I also would like a white version of the case to match my white phone, but oh well."
"I bought this so I could record quick make up tutorials of how I apply my lipstick etc, and it's perfect. Is so small fits on my vanity perfectly and is so sturdy. I love it so much. The little remote worked perfect and came with a battery already. So happy I ordered this"
Blew in the first month complete crap!
"I carry this stand with me all over the house to watch videos while I fold laundry, cook, apply makeup, etc.  my iphone 6 plus sits perfectly and it's very light and durable.  I absolutely love it!"
"The felt version fits my Cricket Wireless LG Risio very well and can be snapped.  If you are looking for something that is not a clunky cover for this model of LG, this will work.  The fit is snug, so I would go with the felt, not sure how the leather version would work.  To get the phone out, pinch the bottom and it slides out."
"Does not work well if your CD slot has a curved face. Many factory CD players have a curved face and this mount does not stay securely in place because the nGroove blade has a straight edge, so the outer parts of the blade don't fully insert into the drive. Other reviewers indicated this still works on a curved slot, but it fails miserably in my car. Stays in place for about 20 minutes and then wobbles and pops out. Sending this one back for refund unfortunately."
"Did not like. Felt cheap, and the cover was sticky. Could not access any of the side buttons and had to take it off almost everytime i wanted to use my phone"
The Zilu Smart Power external battery is a cheap external battery the works very well if you need to charge your device once. It has a full 2 amp outport USB so it charges your phone faster (if you have a phone the can handle 2Amps if not it will use a lower amount.) This external battery also includes smart technology that will detect if your phone is fully charged. The only major issue that I highly is the way the indicator lights shows the charge. If you have the device up right the indicator lights goes bottom to top. But thats not that big of and issue to cause someone not to buy the external battery. You can also get the external battery in different colors. I would really recommend this external battery if you want a small external battery for traveling.<br /><br />&#34;I was provided with a free copy of this item for testing and my fair and honest evaluation”
The sub is everything it says it is I have it bridged to be 2 ohms and its getting at least 500watts rms the sub can move some serious air but if you want to sustain really low notes make sure your enclosure is rated down that low and you will get great results
"Fits in case ,even with my otter box case on it"
I was very please the Motorola Battery for my cell phone. I would be happy to buy again.
Good charged
This sticker adapter worked great  on my phone (Tmobile Note 4). No issues with snapping back the cover either.
They send me a new one and work good!
great!
Love the colors! However it has chipped pretty quickly.
WORKS FINE AND FITS TIGHTER THAN THE ONE THAT CAME WITH THE PHONE
"Great product it's light and for my iPhone 6 perfectly. I recommend this for anyone looking for a light case, this won't weigh down your iPhone either, get one today!!"
i really like it
The best battery case hands down!
Very good
Worked for my Google Tablet (2013) version.  Guys at best buy wanted $200 to fix the usb port but this pad allowed me to charge the tablet and cost so much less.  Thanks.
Works as described & I like it allot better than one that I had that had a separate remote to take the picture. My only gripe is that the instructions are far from in depth & you need to figure out some stuff on your own.
This item came to me dirty and used and only sometimes works... that is when it feels like working.
This has to be one the best battery packs out there and delivery was unbelievable thank you
Good
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
Very good quality case. I love it!
One of the best<br />But this time I was disappointed in<br />However healthier to buy
"[[VIDEOID:409e7fcf7d98fb627689fd15405aaa77]] I like using my phone and sometimes tablet to follow recipes in the kitchen. The thing is I can make a mess and the phone always seems like it is in the way, or I cant see it well. That's where this guy comes in. This is a basic & small but hefty universal stand. I like that it can be used with a number of devices and adjusted to various angles. It has rubber pads under the stand to protect the surface it rests on and provide a bit of grip. The rubber pads are also in the cradle portion where your device rests and on the back to provide a bit of grip and cushion. Full disclosure this was provided to me by the seller to review. If you have any questions please leave a comment and I am happy to respond.<br /><br />Update 11/16: This little stand is still going strong and is used almost every day in my kitchen:)<br /><br />Amazon Disclosure Statement:<br />-I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review; or<br />-I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.<br />Why the statement? Amazon says I have to. Why did I get the product at a discount? I guess I’m lucky. Either way I hope the review was helpful.

"This is a great deal for anyone who needs a spare phone for emergencies.  Or if you are a spy with not a lot of money, and you need a cheap &#34;burner phone&#34; to make calls without worrying if the NSA can track your location, the LG-305 is an excellent choice.  But, all kidding aside, I purchased this phone because I misplaced my Samsung S5, and since I was leaving for NYC in a couple of days, I didn't have time to look around the house for my cell phone.  The LG-305C is very small and I was able to purchase a small holster style case in Manhattan for $5.00  My only issue I have the phone is that a &#34;voice&#34; repeats every command I use for this phone.  Now if I really was a spy, that would be a dead give-away if I was hiding from my pursuers.  Other than that, the LG-305C is a great little phone and the &#34;Triple Minutes for Life&#34; an added bonus."
Just what I needed....
"This is a great tempered glass screeen.  Installation is straight forward and simple if followed correctly.  I have had no issue with it shipping or cracking and it looks and feels like there is nothing covering my screen.  I highly recommend for anyone with a OnePlus One to get this glass protector, you wont be disappointed."
"I like it, my only gripe is the small opening for the headphone jack. Some of my headphones don't fit, any headphone connector larger than iphone oem headphones won't go all the way in the jack with this case on. It feels nice and looks good otherwise, its the best one  I found price wise."
It worked fine
Purchased two of these cable for our iPhones and they work like a charm.  Very pleased with the purchase.
"These little headphones pack a powerful sound punch. The sound is clear and crisp, just as it should be. These are comfortable in my ears. These headphones are just as described. They feel solid and are made very well! The audio quality is awesome."
Thanks
This is the best phone holder I have seen in a long time!! Fits in cup holder and stays in place. Easy to use and holds phone tight!!
"For every phone I had, I would always get two additional batteries so I could always have charge when I went out. Each battery usually lasted around half a day.<br />When I got the Galaxy S5, suddenly my phone could last three whole day, and instead of getting more batteries, I thought I might as well just get one of these.<br />It was a great choice. I can charge my phone 5-6 times on one charge, or charge others' phones, too. I used it on a week long camping trip. If you have anything you can charge with a USB, it's nice for long trips, too! Depending on the charge, it can take up to a day to completely charge.<br />It won't over charge and keeps its own charge without wasting unnecessary power.<br />It looks nice and you can fit it nicely in a backpack. It's nice to take to events you don't know will have outlets, or if you just want to discretely charge your electronics.<br />I might even buy another in the future! Worth every cent."
Comfortable and nice looking. Phone has been dropped a few times and it has been protected from any damage. The colored corners have cracks in them from the drops but has not compromised the cases overall integrity.  ...would recommend.
This has worked well for over a month charging one device or two at the same time.
Have dropped my iPhone multiple times and have had no cracking or issues. Looks nice on my phone; can still see the gold coloring of the iPhone through the case.
Perfect size for carrying in your pocket.Couldn't be happier with this purchase.I got these on a protmotional offer so I could provide my honest feedback on these
"it didn't fit perfectly, my volume button doesn't work properly. It adjust on its on the volume and when I press on it it dosent work to turn up only to turn down."
"A tiny little device with a big impact!  The Lumo Lift was easy to set up with clear app instructions.  I find that the device works not only when I'm wearing it but also when I'm not--I have become more mindful of my posture at all times.  A healthy neutral posture is about more than just straightening up and performing a &#34;shoulders back,&#34; of course--and the Lumo Lift is designed to bring focus only to your upper body positioning.  However, it's an important place to start and I'm definitely digging the healthy feedback from the Lumo Lift.  You won't be disappointed.  (P.S.  Their customer service is terrific.  I had a question and received a response in ~ 24 hours.  Yay!)"
"My niece is 5 and it seems she bends or breaks the smaller end that goes into the IPad Air. This cable seemed stronger then her and so far she's ok with it. I'm glad Anker sees the importance of quality, wether it be cables or chargers!!"
"Why would i give them five stars?.First, their sound quality is very good. Secondly, they have noise cancelling system which is working perfect. Thirdly, their battery life is as described to their descriptions. I workouts everyday at evening and it supports me better. It's sweat proof. Little wire is so smooth. I feel comfortable to use this headphones. Fourth, bluetooth is working fine from far distance. Fifth, price is reasonable, any one can buy with this range. So, all over i can say that this bluetooth headphones is one of the best headphones ever."
"Thanks, great"
Has a very noticeable hissing noise. Wouldn't recommend.
"Very handy, makes for a much more secure feel"
"I bought one of these for my iPhone 5 and then when I upgraded to my 6+, I got this one.  I love this thing.  I use it mainly for my RFID access card at work.  I gave the iPhone 5 one to a fellow worker and he's completely given up carrying a wallet now.  He loves it too."
love this.  life changing item.  really cool and pretty sturdy.  A+
good
"There is just nothing wrong with this phone case. I bought it because of the cute colors available. I wasn't even gonna try Otterbox because it's known for being bulky but this one I guess is the least bulky of all their cases. Even though it's thin, it still gives you the feel that it's durable and that it's gonna protect your phone from breaking in case you drop it accidentally. Would totally recommend this product."
Did not work on my Galaxy S6
The cover is falling off from the side.
"Both cords out of the box will charge my iPhone6, neither one will charge my iPad Air.  The iPad dings as though it has been plugged in and then it shows the message &#34;not charging&#34;"
really strong material to hold your phone while jogging and working out. I put it in on the sleeve of my shirt and it stays there while I work out.
"These wouldn't stay in while I was running; at one point, the rubber earpiece stayed in my ear while the actually headphone slipped out. Also, the signal would cut out every time I adjusted my backpack which my phone was in.  I really wanted to enjoy these, but I had to send them back."
"Bought this for my child for emergency purposes. I love the all the features, esp the ability to connect via wifi.  Even though it has 3g the connection is just was fast as my 4g phone."
They do a good job  !😀
The colour is perfect and fits into my phone. it also came with a very cute thank you card
Worked well at first. After a month the audio started not sounding as good. Now its ao bad its not worth using 6 months in.
Easy installation. Battery continues to work like the new garmin.
Fast Shipping! Great Case!
"Loving my car charger, so necessary for my iPhone."
Thanks.
"Very Acceptable, works as advertised."
"I own 4 different LG models. They are all good, but this one is amazing. Great sound. GREAT sound."
Doesn't work. Won't play the music out loud (aux cord). Save your money
Simply great.
Good case
"Part of the apple watch experience is wearing it everywhere, all day.  Especially during active times, where often there is a greater chance of smacking it on something.  This product is custom fit to protect it very well.  the face is not the first thing to touch due to the raised edges, although you might want to add a screen protector as well.  The only reason it's docked a star is that I had hoped I'd be able to slip it on and off fairly easily to use it just at times I need that extra protection. However, it's functionality of fitting firmly around the body does mean some effort getting it seated properly around the buttons and parts. It was quite tight, and I found heating it in hot water helped make it more pliable to get into place.  So I won't be swapping it back and forth as much as planned.  I'm very happy to have it on hand for sports where a knock or scratch could be an option though."
Well finally after 3 try's this one works! I've gone without a charger for over a month and it was getting a little tiring because returning and re-buying takes so much time waiting to return and waiting for it to be delivered. But now I think everything will be fine. So far this cable does fit and it does work. Thanks to Amazon customer service rep (Norman?) I think his name was??
Nice product
The pricing on this cord was so much better than any place else.  And I can count on the AmazonBasics quality.
"It doesn't fit my iPhone 4 nearly as well as an Otterbox?  I don't like the Otterbox price, but I guess that's why it was only a few dollars?"
was nice and slim fitting and slid into my pocket easily
Better than lifeproof which muffled my voice.  Liked waterproof of LP. But this works great
"Very, very nice case/protector.  Usually I find myself having something wrong.  This one does NOT seem cheaply made at all.  Thank you"
excelent
aaa
Fits my Nook perfectly and working fine.
Great Product!!!!
"For Samsung T899 T-Mobile , simply does not work. No audio, no cel signal. Returned."
Nice durable  case.  The volume and power on/off button very hard to use.
Love it!
The phone is working just fine thank you.
"These are really cool! I use them on all my devices that have cameras - computer, ipad, phones, etc"
These are well worth the money. I carry the phone in my front pants pocket and this cover does not add any unnecessary bulk and it is easy to put in and take out of the pocket.<br /><br />Fit is perfect and gives me a sense of security feeling as though the phone is protected.
One of the pieces was not working at all. I won't buy them again.
"I bought these for my car as I have a charging port in the armrest console and didn't want a huge cable mess to deal with. I have had no problems with this product, and it's nice to have several color options. I keep a couple of these in my backpack for others to use while at work. Worth the money if you only need a short charging cable."
Does not work with my radio. Gives me call numbers for the radio that the radio does not recognize. Completely useless device!
"This case is adorable! I love the color and the elephant design. It's the perfect size for my iPhone, with no interference of the volume or power buttons or the speaker and charging port. Has 2 card slots which is perfect for my license and debit card. The magnetic closure is nice too. No cumbersome button to deal with. That being said, the only thing that would make this a 5 star product would be another magnet on the back to hold the cover when using the phone. Overall  a great product and the different designs it comes in are beautiful.<br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review"
just as description stated. snug fit around phone. beautiful colors. MUCH cheaper than what I found in local stores.
Very loud.  Will shake the whole car and than some
It didn't charge my Samsung well
I used this to replace the screen on my cracked HD7 Kindle.  It was cheaper than a new kindle and the tools and youtube walk through and it was fixed 30 minutes later.  My kids and my wallet were pleased.
Works well
"I love the design! It's sleek and functional, and my Note 4 fits perfectly. The only flaw is that the exterior looked &#34;dirty&#34;. There was no shine or sheen to the patent-leather look. It had many streaks and looked &#34;cloudy&#34;. I returned it and received a replacement, which looked the same. I used different  cleaning products, but the only thing that worked was rubbing alcohol. It looks beautiful now."
I am not pleased with the s5 galaxy case!
very good item good price too
"I love, love love it."
Good case for the money
Sound quality pretty decent and would have given it a 4 stars but somehow died after 2 months of using.
Its a good case and has done a good job at protecting my phone. However i found over and over again that dirt and other particles can easily get behind the screen protector. I have to take it off and clean it at least twice a week. I work in landscape construction so for me this case isn't working out very well. My phone is either in the work truck or in my pocket. Its never just left laying around. Currently looking for a new case.
It didn't work at all with my nose sound dock
Excellent case! Really helps on battery life for my iPhone.
Didn't work with my Galaxy S5 phone.  Designed for smaller phones with out bulky cases.
It takes forever to charge and it gets hot.
great
Love it
Too complicated!
Protects phone nicely. Only complain is it makes the phone bulky
My wife loves this case!  She couldn't be happier with it because of how sturdy the case and the stand are.  She can drop her phone and not freak out anymore!!!
Perfect for Mumford and Sons Fan
"Amazing watch, great, quick shipping. Wife is amazed at how powerful the watch is and all it does."
Just what I needed.  Works great.  Excellent purchase
Otterbox perfection!
"My daughter is in love with her lil gadgets headset..we purchased the pink ones and had a little technical issues the second day of use, contacted lil gadgets and Jason was excellent in helping resolve the issue and best customer service I've experienced in a long time..unlike other customers the sound is perfect it works off my child's volumn controls..the fit is snug and perfect they can even fit my 8 years old head and go right back being snug on my 3 year old...I would recommend easily to anyone and actually plan on purchasing more for our other 3kids for our upcoming road trip.."
Very pleased with my phone case!
EZ to use
I received these in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />They arrived promptly and as described.<br /><br />These cables arrived in easy to open packaging and was simple to assembly.  My IPhone 6 didn't have a problem connecting and charging with these cables.  They are thicker than some of the less expensive models I've owned in the past.  Love it and would recommend it to anyone.
"At this price point I was not expecting this level of quality and was truly impressed. This is primarily made up of metal and has a nice weight which increases the stability of the stand without adding to much bulk. The hole for the cord in the back is a nice feature that help streamline the setup, and the rubberized base protects your electronics. Unfortunately my wife likes it so much I have to get another since she took mine. I have multiple items from this seller and have always received great service, great items and speedy shipping."
"Daughter couldn't go down the river without her phone, so we had to get a case.  This worked perfectly. Not so big that it was hard to carry, and kept the water out!  She keeps it in the bathroom now and uses it when she takes a bath.  Glad it works!"
"I love it, fits perfectly on the phone and in my hand.  :)"
Saved my iPhone 6 from a disaster. Great warranty service as well. The protector does not have the best coverage.<br /><br />EDIT: Looks like the newer version has a better screen coverage compared to the pre release versions Tech Armor released
great case.  being on a farm i have no worries when it comes to keeping my phone safe.  it is harder to hear when talking to anyone but i just put it on speaker phone and problem solved
Love it
I love this screen protector.  I was afraid I'd drop my new phone and break the screen but now I don't have to worry about it.  The screen arrived in a few days.  It went on very easily and not a single bubble!  It seems like all the other screen protectors I've purchased for my various phones and tablets had at least one bubble somewhere  but not this one!  I love it!
"it is a nice pen for the price, works great with the ipad, and the ink side is nice.  the only thing is the pen is a bit short, but other than that I love it."
"Galaxy S6 Active, if you don't know, is a heavily durable marvel of a phone with a bit of extra coating -- but not so much that it's heavier than any other case.  Unfortunately, this charging station is so ridiculously finnicky that you can have the charger perfectly lined up and have the charging light at a perfect solid green and still have no charge.<br /><br />I've left my phone on this for over a half hour.  I come back to a 5% battery.  No seriously, it was 10% when I put it on there.  Even when you spend five minutes lifting it up and putting it back down over and over to ensure the light is green and the phone actually recognizes it (these are two separate things, by the way -- the light can be green and your phone won't know there's a charger there), you still need to be certain that it's doing anything by monitoring it.  I did both of these, still 5%.  It was plugged directly into an outlet, too, so there was zero interference or loss of power.<br /><br />I was looking forward to this product and had my hopes up.  Unfortunately this is worst product I have ever purchased.  The wired cord that comes with it is significantly more reliable, works every time without the wireless base, so it's definitely the charger itself."
helps keep me on track with daily walking. had to go online to figure out how to work it though
"I'm really happy how the harness turned out. there is 1 issue however. the accessory wire does NOT turn off the stereo. this is an issue on VW's end. simple enough, just rewire the accessory wire to either the fuse panel or the cigarette lighter. personally, I installed it on the fuse panel. (picture for more details). look at the other reviews for tips and advice in the installation of this product."
Phone had a lot of cracks. Also when installing the service to the phone the worker said it was water damaged. Come to find out the speakers became loud static and Bluetooth to a wireless speaker sounds far worse. I would not recommend or order from this user again.
Great cable! It's the perfect size and makes everything sound great! Thank you :}
Love this case!  I work at a phone store so. Wing able to have the second brand as we sell in the store was a big deal for me. It showed up on time and works amazingly with my phone!
As advertised.
Good producto
"To date this has been a good cell phone choice for my wife who favors screen size over portability. The phone is perfect for her, too large to strap onto my arm for a run."
Good
This works great.I did have an issue with the items but their customer service support helped me fix the issue right away. This helps so much getting the kids electronic devices charged for school fast and easy...no more looking for free plug ins or half charging an item so the next one can be charged...this saves my day!!
"I love my Ranboo I use it everyday when I go walking, shopping. It's just the right size for your everyday basic needs. I would highly recommend this to anyone."
Love these cases. The durability is amazing.
This is a great portable charger.  I do wish it was flat instead of square but it is worth the price
Had to return.
It didn't work well with my OnePlus One.
"This item was EXACTLY what I was needing.  I have a Bluetooth speaker (jawbone) attached to my bike frame but it is difficult to access the buttons so I had been attaching my phone to my waist to adjust the volume but this was uncomfortable.  I now keep my phone in my bike bag and can pause, play, control the volume and skip tracks....perfect with this button attached to my handlebars.  For my bike that has a smaller diameter handle bar, I have added some electrical tape to the area where I attach the button.  Item is very responsive, is small and works great."
Came exactly on time and is excellent quality. The sides are rubbery so there's no breakage like with a lot of cases. I really like the feel of the coverings for the volume buttons and hold button. 10/10
was good
Good
Great case for the price. Not as much protected as more expensive cases.
"It was awful, I had to charge my phone 4 times a day."
"Works great.  Very durable cord, seems to be holding up well."
Disappointed because it didn't last two charges
Good
This thing for fun))  I like it)
Rocking phone!
"My phone is older and I could not find a case for it at the mall or the T Mobile store.  I found this case online, and it fits perfectly and I love the little kickstand that allows me to stand my phone on a flat surface to read/watch something online.  The screen saver was not sticky enough to adhere to the phone, though, so I had to throw it out.  Love the case, though."
very useful
"I just got this case.  It's great looking, fits my phone perfectly and has a solid grip.  This is the nicest phone case I've ever had."
Cant wait for my phone case to come
"This bluetooth performs exceptionally well in all respects.<br />1.  Fit and comfort. Exceeds my expectations in both categories.  Bluetooth comes with three ear buds (small, medium & large).  It takes a few minutes to get the hang of putting the buds on and taking them off the bluetooth but you can then experiment with all three to find the right fit.  At first I tried to wedge it in because it did not seem reasonable to expect it to stay in unless it was wedged in.  This product is designed to sit in your ear.  You do not need to put it in like a cork.  For me it fits perfectly with the bud facing back and slightly down.  Very comfortable, I can literally leave it in all day with no discomfort.  Buds are very soft and pliable<br />2.  Range-excellent.  I can leave my phone plugged in and walk outdoors<br />3.  Sound quality. Very good. Can be used to listen to books or music but good buds or headset would be preferable for music.<br />4.  Battery and recharge.  Very easy to recharge with the charging station.  Recharge lasts the full 6 hours and only takes 90 minutes.<br />5.  Bells & Whistles.  As with other plantronics this one works with voice commands and announces callers by name from contacts<br />Highly recommended, does not fall out of your ear and does not need to sit outside of your ear."
"Great screen protector! The fit is perfect, although it does take extra effort to align correctly with the phone &#34;Close All&#34; and &#34;Return&#34; icons at the bottom. It covers the entire screen perfectly. I did see some reviewer state that it did not. I don't know if there are variant versions of this screen protector; mine did cover the entire screen. This complete coverage can be a plus or a minus when using some phone cases. For example, there are no issues with the screen protector edges raising when using the Samsung Galaxy S6 Case, Rock Touch Series - Ultra Thin Premium Leather Flip Case. However, there are issues when using another case, such as the Galaxy S6 OBLIQ [Slim Metal] Thin Bumper Fit Armor Scratch Resist Metallic Finish Dual Layered Heavy Duty Hard Protection Hybrid. Most cases that ride on the topmost part of the chamfered edges may cause the screen protector to raise up."
Did not fit well
You may want to try ringke but this one is also ok
works well with my iphomes
Phone case is beautiful but the paint keeps falling off and it just doesn't look good anymore I'm very upset with this. DO NOT BUY
It does what it is supposed to do with no problems.
Flimsy product
great
I purchased it for a 200W Coleman quick air pump.  A few months later I took it out of the package for a camping trip. It first kept beeping at me then did not work at all.  Amazon will not let me return because beyond the 30 days.
"Really good case with a strong magnet. Good feel. The slot on the inside is glued shut and you have to carefully use a sharp knife edge to open the glue joint holding its edge shut. Warning, the slot puts a portion of what ever card you have in it on top of a strong magnet and that will wipe out a magnetic stripe so I suggest not using the slot at all with any card that has a mag stripe ;)"
Works great
"Great product. Works exactly as it's supposed to. Even comes with a warranty, which is nice. No complaints!"
"Love this case, but the cord to charge, are you kidding me ? Way too short, need some length !!"
Convenient and easy to use.
"Charges an IPhone 6 Plus wirelessly.  Easy to install into the Phone, I have mine on the outside of my case!  Does take slightly longer to charge than being plugged in."
"easy to install and feels like it will work. unfortunately that was not the case for me. I have the tempered glass screen protector in combination with a hybrid case that has a built in plastic screen protector. I dropped my phone from my locker (maybe 2 feet from the ground) and noticed a crack. crossed my fingers that it was the screen protector doing its job and not my phone screen that broke, but it didn't look to be that way. turns out my screen cracked and the protector did not. 1 star for this. ordered a new one from another company."
This was billed as an unlocked tablet and its not. Its a T-Mobile tablet.
Seems poorly made. Slips out of the holster too easily. Case/holster is too slick... it slides around way too much. Not rubberized at all. This unit also doesn't stand in the landscape orientation too well without falling over all the time.
this charger is so cute only down side is that its poorly made the ports either come off or it just stops working. Either way my clients love it I would buy again for the 4th time!
"High quality cord, thick and durable. Recommended purchase."
Did not fit
"When reading reviews on this band, one stuck out &#34;not a want, a NEED!&#34;  I decided to take a chance, and I won!! LOVE this band, ridiculous fit, form fit to the watch, and quality material. It looks and feels expensive, a perfect partner to the watch. If you are even kind of thinking about buying this, GET IT.<br />Only thing, the pin remover that comes with it for removing band pieces is a little cheap. I bent the pin once or twice while trying to remove a link. No biggie, used a screw driver and pliers to straighten it out."
cheap junk
Has a hard time connecting with anything I try to connect to it.  I had to cut power to it and re-connect power to get it to reset/work at all.  Super frustrating.  Sending it back for refund
I have brought this phone from Amazon because my wife told me the site is trust worthy however on my arrival to barbados when I went to my local provider and did the necessary documents put the SIM card into the phone it have not work since I am so upset I have no clue what to do not good at all
Damaged product
"Beautiful packaging and wonderful directions that went with it! I usually have bad luck with putting on screen protectors rather crooked or tones of bubbles but with the tools they give you along the clear and easy to follow directions, it was a peace of cake and I don't mean to brag but mine is on there pretty perfect! The clarity is like nothing is on my screen no  cloudiness what so ever also the cover feels like the apple glass so going from no cover to this was seamless!"
"i like it, but i thought that the case would connect to the phone like the expensive phone cases. oh well"
Rugged and stylish. Perfect case that lasted for a long time.
"Love this amp...thought I damaged  it, ordered another only to find the amp protected itself.  Now I have two.  About to up grade so I can use both"
"LOVE this wallet. Yeah, it got stolen due to my lack of attention, but when I had it it was great. It is a little bulkey, but personally, I like that. :D"
"Screws fall out if not tightened every other day, rubber is cheap, and absolutely huge and impractical."
"I am very sad abut this, but I am extremely dissatisfied about this Up24 from Jawbone.<br />After having worked perfectly during almost a year, Two weeks ago the band just stopped working and it would take any charge anymore.<br /><br />I was expecting this to work for at least a couple of years."
Just as described.
On time Delivery and the product is as described. Happy customer
It's nice to have a built in screen protector and it fits in my pocket well. Only criticism is that to charge the phone you have to take the case apart because the connection doesn't fit well into the phone through the case opening
this was a bad purchase
It just sticks to stuff.....great product!
Fall apart and break on the micro usb side. Do not buy this brand.
"Hello out there! This review is credulous and fortunate for me; this item took 35 min to charge, 15 sec to pair one phone and turn it off,<br />15 sec to pair second phone and turn it off, turn the main phone (default phone) on first pair in 8 sec, turn second phone on and it pair in<br />10 sec. It plays music right away or you push on/off to stop. If you want the music to continue just do nothing until a call comes in. Also I left my phone on the table and walk outdoor about 25 yards away &#34;the music continue and another time I received a call while out at the mail box &#34;it was clear and the caller could hear clearly too. YES I SAY TO YOU BUY IT"
Great protection for my phone and really easy to clean. Seriously best phone case ever.
my wife loves her case
"Excellent.  It keeps all my electronics charged at all times.  I don't have to keep looking for AC outlets at the airport.  Furthermore, I heard that some public phone charging outlets may be stealing people's data when they plug in to charge."
"didnt fit, I blame nobody except amazon"
EXCELLENT SERVICE GREAT
Excellent product
"center metal screen rusted out quickly, not very pleased with this product."
Love the blue collar that makes our male Weimaraner stylish and quiet!
Very high quality. The price is higher than the cheapest but the quality is unmistakeable. The cord is heavier and the connectors are more robust. I like the extra length.
Convenient. Does its job.
It's OK ... larger than I'd like.  Belt clip falls off occasionally ... haven't tried the armband.  When it stops working I'll buy something different.
It's excellent. Just wish it came with a clip
love idea of thicker cord but my phone rejects it
"I love this phone case. Very stylish, holds phone in snug, closes shut with magnetic clasp. Would highly recommend!"
good
Perfect to take on a road trip
Much better than Mpow Streambot Oval FM Transmitter Wireless which I brought earlier....!!

"This works really well as a dual amp charger. It charges my iPod Touch faster than a regular charger. I have had this for quite a while and it has helped me wonderful. However I have started noticing that when I am plugged in with this the screen on my iPod  starts to malfunction slightly (Not respond correctly). I liked this charger but I read online that third party chargers could have something to do with that. I'll probably get a better one, but for other purposes this will work fine"
Fast shipping!! Loved it
"With two 2A ports this charger will do two tablets at once or speed charge your smart phone. The unit has folding prongs so it travels without damaging your stuff or itself. The best part about it is when I plugged my old iPhone up suddenly the lights went dim in the house and BAM! just like that it converted it into an iPad! Wow! I was wanting a new iPad! SO feeling lucky I plugged in my MP3 player and BAM!, yes BAM!  it turned into a stereo with surround sound and the works!  This thing makes me wish I could plug my car into it.. bet It'd go Ferrari on me.. Hey this charger is the best and I'll likely get another.  I never seem to have enough ports where I want them and with two 2A outputs my wife and I can charge simultaneously. Make the choice for RAVPower and your gear will charge like never before.. heck it might even upgrade itself!"
Effects the car battery
"This thing is awesome! Its small and quickly charges my phone and tablet. I bought it when it went on sale for 10$, which is a great price to pay for this product. This product doesn't come with a wall charger but it comes with a USB to micro USB. Since I had an old wall charger from a phone, I was able to use that. If you have a Samsung Galaxy, the USB charging cord that comes with it can be used to charge your phone. The cord that comes with it is not super long, which I like while charging my phone because it doesn't get in the way.<br /><br />Pros: Small, charges quickly, holds good charge easy to use, indication of external battery charge with LED<br /><br />Cons: Sometimes if its charging something for a while it gets hot, doesn't come with a wall charger (wasn't a big deal to me)"
Great. can add pics from camera to computer.
"Don't think it is the correct one, I have to take it off to charge my phone."
was not for the iphone 5s either
"Works great, I use it for my Microsoft Surface 3  2 phones and a Samsung 12.2 pro tablet  . Non of the plugs even get slightly warm. thank you Anker for making a great product that doesn't cost an arm and a leg."
"Too difficult to sync. I had to return mine, Which is something rare for me."
"This 6-port USB power outlet solved our dilema of too many devices; not enough outlets.  Perfect for the family room.  We have had four phones and two tablets plugged in at once, and the charger performed flawlessly."
The cables seem very sturdy. Shipping was quick. An awesome product at a great price.
This broke instantly after fitting it to my phone. Terrible quality.
"Bought for my kid - works great, but not sure what the plastic back is supposed to do...it barely stuck to the back of the phone..."
works fine
"Nice clean eazy to read, able to hear, good clear volume."
"I owned many headphones and earbuds cheap and expensive, these earbuds for some reason stand out as the best earbuds I have ever owned. I bought 5 at once so I have them for a long time. It fits the ear well, also comes with two other replacement smaller and larger.  I used them initially with blackberry and that's how I got the fist pair, but then they worked excellent with my iPhones since I made the switch few years ago. Mine started falling apart because they were the only earbuds I can use reliably. Very good quality and delivers excellent sound as well as excellent clarity and reliability to use with the phone. Compared to much more expensive earbuds, these are &#34;Highly&#34; recommended."
Great product! Just as described.
I am giving these a 4 star rating because all of my other wireless Bluetooth headphones never stay in my ears when I'm working out but these do! I love the color too! My only complaint is that my particular headphones are in Japanese or Chinese (sorry I'm not sure which one). I also received an instruction manual for a different version of the PECHAM Bluetooth headphones. See pic.
"Durability is bad. My screen spider webbed 2 days after having it. Do not remember ever hitting it on anything. So it was lightly tapped or had pressure on it. I contacted the seller. they said they would fix screen for 30$. While nice they offered to fix, 30$ every 2 days is not my cup of tea. But, while it did work, well after the bt notification setup with no instruction. Looked at youtube video. I did like the watch. Liked that my wrist vibrated and I could see who is calling. My phone does not come out of my pocket easy so I loved this. could respond to txt also. really liked it. I would use this and support it if it did not break so easy. BTW if it spider webs. you can no longer use it, touch screen does not work. had to take battery out to shut it off.<br />so my 2 stars is solely on durability, well and screen size was a little bulky. but that is a touch screen, could get used to that. I personally would like a smaller, not much, just a litter smaller screen, just to see who is calling, texting and such. thats just my preference"
It works as its supposed to but will disconnect randomly.  update : the company saw my review and sent me a new one for free. new product does not have any issues.
I love this Galaxy S6 Edge slim case. I like how it snaps on the back easily. It fits great and is lightweight and not bulky. I like the burgundy color I picked out and they way it looks and fees is great. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.
"I was in between many iPhone 6 armbands and I chose this one because it seems like it is more likely to fit my iPhone 6 WITH its case in it. And GREAT news...IT DID! I was so thankful that I didn't have to take my phone out of the case and put it in the armband. My only complaint is that the material is bit flimsy compared to all my previous iPhone 4, 5, iPod Touch, etc. armbands I bought in the past. I'm not sure how long it will last, but hopefully until the next iPhone comes out!"
Fast shipping... I'm satisfied overall with it and it works good.. Signal is the same... Great look
Nice product.
Working very good.
"This ReGear iCharger is a 30 pin charger for the car. It works fine to recharge my daughter's iPhone 4S. She is happy, so I am happy. We've not had any issues with this charger. Since it is for the car only, it's getting only light use. I received this at a discount in exchange for a fair review, which I have provided."
"Works great with iPhone 6. Does get a little loose when I'm trying to type while leaving phone on stand but, other than that, this product works perfect!"
Cheap quality! Started leaking on second day of usage!
After looking for a good small portable speaker I decided on this one. All the reviews sounded great.  The speaker surpassed my expectation on both sound and battery life great product!
"WOW!  This is a spectacular high capacity portable charger.  It's an amazing 20,000 mAh and can charge your phone, ipad, kindle, computer or any other electronic device!  It has two dual charging capacities:  1 amp and 2 amp.  It can charge multiple devices without running out of juice.  I have used 8,000 mAh's before and it can charge my phone probably twice.  But I love that I can charge two devices at the same time and it is just as quick.  It does only come with one usb cord, but that's okay as I have plenty of usb cords and ac jacks.<br /><br />It is small enough to fit inside your briefcase or purse.  It is a bit heavier (almost one pound) and larger than my other chargers, but I gladly exchange the capacity of this one with my other smaller, less capacity portable chargers, despite its weight.  Taking this portable charger on my overseas trips will be an immeasurable benefit.  Even my other higher capacity chargers run out of juice if I am taking photos all day long with my phone with no opportunity to recharge.  There is also a neat little flashlight on the end of the battery pack.  You can use this flashlight to help plug in your electronic device in the dark - which helps immensely.  I highly recommend this charger for your portable needs!"
Got this case as a gift...it arrived in a timely manner and the person loved it! Glad the Star of Life Defender case was finally made available for iPhone 6!!
"Working as advertised, great buy"
Great it works perfect
I bought Two of the TUDIA Ultra Slim Full Matte Cases a Black & a Blue the Blue is tuff Looking But if You have a Screen Protector it will push agents it and make bubble on the edges they are  Great Cases well made.
Great price for a good dependable phone:)
Great÷
Works perfectly.
Terrible product. I was initially impressed as it worked as it should but it quickly stopped working and I had to purchase another product from another vendor.<br /><br />Stopped working in less than 4 months.
it covers my phone neat
Good
A great phone holder
It's ok; a very good product.
This case fits my HTC One M8 perfectly! It said it was going to take a long time to get here but it actually came like a full two weeks sooner. It's just as beautiful as the picture. I don't know why but it took me a little wiggling to get the charm to fit into the aux space but now that it's in it looks super cute! It looks very good and has an awesome price to match. And if it ends up falling apart in a few months then I can just easily replace it.
great
Like this cellphone!
It's so cute & came way earlier then any of my other cases & I ordered them 2-3 weeks before .<br />I had the pink one before the purple one . I think the pink one actually looks better I just can't seem to find it .<br />& it doesn't stink or nothing . YES !!
Excellent device. Bit my phone like a dream and makes my phone look very cool. Thank you very much.  I would recommend this item to anyone that asked.
I am on my second Linear Bluetooth Neck Loop. I used my first Linear neck loop for over a year before it quit. I find the bluetooth version much easier to use and much less of a hassle than wired neck loops. I strongly recommend it.
"Top poo art broke after two weeks. I taped it and added padding,  they still work.  Cheap made. Covers over the speaker come off too easy.  Elecronic parts are great, but the build quality is poor.  Amazon basics for $14. Are far better.  I just got them and was shocked.  Cord on this is rubber feeling . Goos.  Overall do not buy.  Better ones for under $20."
Great for working on computers.
Works exactly as described!  Perfect for my new charging station!
perfectly fits my iphone 6 with otterbox
"22ctech, USB CHARGER, 6 Port USB Charger, 60 Watt, POWERFUL, PORTABLE Charger, Rapid, Travel Charger, with Auto Detect Technology, Desktop Charger  FOR REVIEW<br />EXCELLENT  desk top charger,this is a great addition to anyone's charging  station or just take it with you; this thing is all around one of the best and most powerful combined. the auto detect feature is the bomb, truly glade i got this in my book it is top of the line"
"DON'T BUY THIS!! It is very cheap for a reason. It only lasted about a week before part of it broke off on the side, and now a week later a lot more on the side has broken off. It's very thin. Cheap made. Sometimes you do get what you pay for..."
Arrived on time and works great!
"It seems to work as expected.  A bit bulkier than I expected, but manageable."
the swirl did not met my expectations.  The ability to extend the stylus was difficult in that it came out and the part that is to fit into my 6Iphone is too narrow to fit snugly and therefore they fell off  often .
very good!
"Ordered 3, 1 worked."
"Excellent idea to add in different lenses to your iPhone 6. The frame is easy to connect (although the case needs to be removed for ours), and the lenses go on quickly and easy. This could really increase your enjoyment of the iPhone's superb camera features."
For the price of this bluetooth earpiece it's very comfortable and worth the money doesn't have all the features of my Jabra Stone but it's still well worth it. Very comfortable to wear and secure in my ear.
"It was not what I thought it would be .  Did not fit the phone, waste of money"
great buy
"Screen cracked within days of application. I contacted Sir Lancelot's Armor through Amazon four different times about the defective product and getting it replaced under warranty. They have completely ignored me and I guess I was ripped off. I thought they were legit, but obviously a lot of other people are upset with the poor performance of the product and agree Sir Lancelot Armor Company does not stand behind the advertised warranty."
"Device holder is awesome, holds my phone securely with no shaking.  Thanks a lot guys.  Great product :)"
"Had the case for two days now and so far so good, it fits nice and snug on my S4 and though it may not be as sturdy as my OtterBox it is less bulky."
yes
"I love the case, however, it was supposed to be blue but what I received was a bright pink!"
The case was printed and looked nothing like the Tory burch logo. It was blurry and rough and I was very unsatisfied!
This case is an excellent value. I find I like it better than the Pelican case I am replacing it with.
So far the quality has been great. I've had it less than a month so we will have to see what
"When I first got it and saw all the instructions and steps I thought it was overkill.  When I was done (after following said instructions) I was really glad because I had a fingerprint, lint, dirt and bubble free cover for my phone face.  It looks great and the helpful stickers are reusable."
Very impressed with this phone case!
I have no problems excellent product same charging speed as the white 3.0 charger +100
"I bought this phone from &#34;232Tech&#34;, they get 4 stars because I order a &#34;Black&#34; model and instead, I got the &#34;White&#34; model.<br /><br />So far, the product meets the expectation... a simple Android-based to keep Grandma in touch via Skype and WhatsApp."
"These headphones are great. It easily syncs with your computer, phone, (or car if it has bluetooth capabilities). It comes with directions that are fairly straight forward and also comes with a charging cord, 3 sizes of ear rubbers (they come with the medium size on) and three sizes of ear rubbers so you can customize the headphones to best fit your ear. As for the bluetooth headphone quality, it is excellent. The sound is crisp and clear. However, the farther from the source you get, the worse the quality gets (as expected) so make sure to stay in the general area in order to have the best results.<br /><br />I attached a picture of what how the earphones go in because I felt like that part was confusing in the instructions. The rubber part that you see in the picture that is standing up goes in a crevasse in your outer ear. This rubber support helps keep the earphone in place and, since it is rubber, is not very noticeable.<br /><br />Overall, these are great headphones. I use them when I'm cleaning and they have been awesome. Very secure with the rubber support :)! Definitely would recommend these!<br /><br />*I received this product complimentary to test and give my honest review*"
good so far
The product arrived shortly after ordered and this one actually works unlike the other charger I ordered.
The person I got it for loved it.  Thank you once again for great service.
"It fit perfectly -- Looks good too. But after 3 months the edge just cracks off, in each corner in big chunks. Customer service was non-responsive."
Worked just fine.
Nice product
Prefect
"Works flawlessly.  Original battery had reach end of life, you would need to charge the phone once, sometimes twice during the day.  Now with this battery based on my usage i go all day and sometimes til the next morning before charging.  Also the NFC chip works just like the original.  Some other batteries on Amazon got bad ratings due to lack of the NFC function.  This battery is definitely worth it."
"Works great, protects well. Great design to help keep hold of it. Only downside is the top and bottom are loose but not a major issue. Easy to remove and clean."
The first Nexus 6 I got had a cracked display.  The replacement I have had for two weeks and a couple rows in the display are &#34;dead&#34;.  Very distracting... doesn't got away with reboot.<br /><br />Has this fabrication issue been fixed?  Not sure if I should return or replace...
had to return it because you cant get the app on ITunes any more.
Very good for tablets and phones.
"Glass shattered after 2 weeks, been trying to get a replacement for 6 weeks."
Great product really makes the phone look nice and it protects it
"the product came with two lenses rather than three but I could have lived with the two if the lenses worked at all, they don't. The fish eye does indeed distort the image but the increased field of view is limited and the macro lens was useless. I wasn't expecting a great deal from the optics for 5.99 but this kit is useless. The lenses were to used for a kids science project, the kit was useless so I ended up cannibalizing an LED flashlight lens which worked fine. Save your money , don't buy this kit."
"I have used this for a week. Comfortable, warm and has good quality sound. Slept through a neighbor's party."
"I upgraded from a 4S to a gold iPhone 6, and I wanted a case that was protective, slender and still allow me to admire the beauty of the iPhone 6. I was skeptical at first because I usually go for an Otter Commuter case. I provided a total of 6 photos from all angles of the case. I love the ease and smooth feel of using the up/down volume buttons and on/off/hold button on the opposite side. All the other port openings are perfectly sized. I also like the thickness of the clear bumpers around the edges of the phone. There is a lip around the bumper of the phone so face of the phone is not flush with a surface when the phone is put face down. I have a tempered glass screen protector and it will not touch the surface when put face down. There is also a smaller lip on the back around the bumper. I love the clear back and how it shows off the phone. I may buy a second one in another color to change it up the look."
"This case for the GoPro is perfect for two cameras and accessories. It will protect your gear very well without weighing you down, especially if you are traveling."
A very good case.  It works great.
"I ordered one to try about a week ago and loved it. Not only is it constructed very well but those clips top and bottom are definitely not going anywhere when you clip them. It is very flexible and there is no stopping it when it comes to the position of viewing. The possibilities are endless. Hehe. Great viewing experience with either, my iPhone or Samsung Galaxy. No more achy hands and arms holding up cellphone for 2 hours. I clip anywhere and watch. My favorite is clipping it to edge of futon and voila, I just lay back comfortable and enjoy a good movie. I fell in love with this product that I went ahead and ordered a few days ago 2 more for my son and a friend. I highly recommend this product and for the price, you simply cannot beat it."
Works great
Just beautiful and I love it.
I got this for a Co worker and she loves it
"Bought it and stuck it in the car port, but did not use it for months.  Then discovered that it will not power up an iPad or iPhone.  Too late to return.  Oh, well, live and learn."
As described. Came in on time! Snugs well. Designed to hold maybe 3 cards but will be hard to pull them out. Over all... its a good buy!
Didn't like it at all
bought this so i can use my phone in the shower. and it works. every single morning. speakerphone even works fine. will purchase more for travel and work. very satisfied.
husband loves it
It was just what I wanted!  Very well made!  Thank you so much.  Pam Fink
Awesome. My son loved it
Really like the look. I have received many compliments
This cover fits nicely but it also retains heat. Even with no activity my phone was always hot.
"I am always looking for a new case for my phone that will let it be more useful, enter the Card Slot Slim Armor case by Spigen. It features a solid case with the added benefit of having a slot for 2 credit cards. I used to use a Bulldog case and it added a little bulk but not much, this case by spigen ups the bulk a tiny bit but then again it function as a wallet as well and that is worth the bulk. The case has a rubber lib that covers the front of the screen to keep it raised so if you lay the phone face down (or drop it) the phone screen will be protected. The back is a hard plastic but has that removable slot for your cards to go into it. It only holds 2 cards, don't try to load more than that in it otherwise it will bulge and the slide/door could break. It works really well for what it is and I have no complaints over it other than this one, it makes the phone a tad slippery and because of that I am removing a star. Other than that this case really does a great job protecting the phone and adding more functionality at the same time.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above at a discount or for free in the hope that I would write a review about it. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: &#34;Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.&#34;"
awesome product at a competitive price!
"Great Product at a great price.  Works as promised and provides secure placement for your iPhone and is comfortable to boot.  I would recommend this to runners and walkers everywhere.<br /><br />I find the Iphone 6 itself too big to enjoy wearing in the gym, but that is due to the Iphone and not this product.  This will work for the gym if you don't mind the size of the Iphone itself."
"Does a great job of covering the front and back of your phone. If you pair this with a sturdy screen protector, you're phone would be indestructible."
"I had a blu phone before but this one is exceptional phone, it weighs more than what I had before, I like it and the price is so convenient"
I am addicted to these!
works great
excellent!
Using it to hold a cell phone for an elderly person. Works great!
I am highly impressed with it and can recommend for anyone as a great alternative for a power bank.
Love the bumpers and the color choices. The back is clear with the color along the sides of the phone. I hate bulky cases and a bumper is the perfect choice for me.
Awesome
"Excellent holster for such a low price. When my wife lost her holster I expected a Blackberry-branded replacement to cost much more. This one is just fine--sturdy and serviceable. Highly recommended for a name brand, sturdy functional replacement holster."
"I love this case; and now that I store my wallet's contents in the same place as my iPhone, I have renamed the App &#34;Find my iPhone&#34; to &#34;find my wallet!&#34;"
Great band but slow delivery!
Best case ever. I get so many compliments on it!
i like that they cover the entire screen.
Is very good quality  lovely :) i loved
"This case is attractive, the color is true to what I ordered, and it fits as described.  The only complaint is that it is a bit thick and bulky.  Not terribly so, but thicker than I'd have liked. Overall, a very good case and protection."
Needed them and they arrived fast
great camera just try it
I couldn't get mine to work
"Even though it's rubber and flexible, it fits like a glove and protects the iPod!"
Great!
"Nice cover, fits perfectly."
fits great
I love this case- the design and the coverage of the phone.
Love the case and at a great price.
"This is a great case, it has a good snug fit on my phone without limiting access to anything  on the phone. All of the buttons are still functioning and the case doesn't block my camera. It was very easy to install on my device, it also came with instructions to help you out. It hasn't blocked any reception, I still hear crystal clear on my phone. I ordered a clear grey phone case because I like to keep things simple, but there is alot of other color choices to choose from. This Phone Case by COLLEN is a quality phone case.<br /><br />(I purchased this phone case at a discounted price in exchange for my fair, honest & unbiased review of the phone case after using it.)"
works perfectly!
great
Love it.  This is the third one I have purchased.
This product worked for a total of three days.  I used the headphones two days at the gym and they worked fine and easily paired. On the third day they would not pair.  The battery was fully charged and I could hear the &#34;power on&#34; and  &#34;power off&#34; feedback but they were undiscoverable and would not pair.
love it! great look
This is well made. Well designed and can charge either or both an iPad and iPhone. My guess is it has enough juice to charge an iPhone at least 3 times before needing a re-charge. Would I ever use the flashlight? Perhaps it would come in handy when traveling or when light is unavailable.
"I'm unable to get this thing to charge any of my phones.  Since I made the mistake of throwing away the packaging, I'm stuck with this POS.  I got curious and opened it up.  If the coils are placed directly against the back of a phone, it will charge, but assembled normally, it won't charge.  The fatal flaw of this thing is that it's really bad at detecting when a Qi device is near either of the coils.  With the unit disassembled and the coil directly against the back of a phone, the charging rate is comparable to other Qi chargers... but this is of no use when the unit can't detect a Qi enabled phone in normal operation."
"Charges intermittently after 95% charge. Charging stops-starts again-stops again. Very annoying and distracting when the phone screen lights up, dims and goes off only to repeat the cycle all over again. Takes a very long time to reach 100%."
Screen protector was easy to apply and is cut perfectly for this hard to fit screen. Once applied it's virtually unnoticeable (except for the cutouts for the cameras / mic which are absolutely necessary). Buying another right now.
"Durable. Have not had any issues. Dropped my phone in this case and no cracks, breaks or anything. Would recommend it. Like the sleek professional look of it as well."
Exactly as described
"I really like this camera the screens is nice and big compared to other dash cams. It comes with everything you need to use it. A suction cup and bracket to hook it to the windshield, a plug to charge it, I suggest you leave it plugged in all the time because it kind of dies quickly. It does not come with the micro sd card so it needs one. There are tons of settings, on it you can record for 2, 5 or 10 minutes at a time or whatever you like. After it records so many times it will record over the old recordings and does it again and again and again. What I really like about this is that I can aim it in any direction or angle I want it's very versatile on the bracket that holds it."
"For the price it is a bargain. Minus one star for the back clip slightly short and it would sometimes fall off the vent. I suppose it depends how your vent is shaped. Regardless, it does the job and good value."
I love it! It makes your phone more comfortable to hold. And keep it safe.
Item didn't fit very well and it was very difficult to push the buttons
Super cute case. I've gotten. Lots of compliments on it. It's thin and comfortable. Not sure it protects much but still worth the buy.
this phone cover was for my neighbor girl. she likes it. the color is nice. and fits good.
"I received my iPhone 5C Case, MagicMobile® Cute Ultra Slim Protective [Hybrid Impact] Hard Durable Thin TPU Cover for Apple iPhone 5C Armor Shell [ Black - Red ]Case with Clear Screen Protector by MagicMobile and all I can say is quality. This was a great case for the price. if you are looking for a great case that offers great protection look no further.<br /><br />Five star product for sure. I received this product in exchange for an honest review."
Works Well.
"Great product.  Just check the size before you buy.  Others might see this a bit big and weighty but the capacity is great.<br />Also, there is no instruction for the flashlight feature.  You have to press the power button about 3 seconds, then it will light up.  Same thing when you turn it off."
I really like this product. I feel more secure handling phone.
Woks well
"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
Awesome
These are pretty awesome for how little they cost. They sound decent enough and the battery lasts quite a while. Totally worth it.
"great headphones for the price! I bought them because my similarly priced Sony's were wearing out, and those don't cancel noise half as well. I think the black looks nicer on second thought, but the white ones give me no problems"
I ordered this case for my 6 but didnt realize that i actually ordered for a 6plus. Its a great quality case which si why i will reorder it BUT the right size this time.
This works brilliantly. Well made. Great length for easy carry and does not get tangled up like longer cords.
"A little too small in width for galaxy Note 4 with UAG case, but it can fit in and the velcro is secure."
No real difference for me between the desktop model and this one. Didn't broadcast the signal out of my room.
"[[VIDEOID:95879b2fb18a0f936c31fdf7711179ba]]I have seen several type of these cases that have the kick out so you can stand up your iPhone 6 either horizontal or vertical but this one by Collen is far superior then others out there. The material and the construction are great quality and vibrant colors. The fit is perfect. The instructions did not state if you kept the two pieces together or not. We found it easier to separate the \\""gray\\"" hard backing from the silicone \\""green\\"" piece. As you can see in the video it is easy to install on your iPhone 6. All of the phone buttons work perfectly with the case on and it is very stylish. It does come in several different colors but I choose the green/gray since that is one of my husbands favorite colors. He drives a Jeep and there is a perfect spot to place his iPhone 6 with the kick stand horizontal so he can use his GPS in his Jeep it sits perfectly. He too is very impressed with the quality of this iPhone 6 case and he has used at least 10 different cases. I received this product for a discounted price for my unbiased and honest opinion."
These are a must for power users. I have 3 total!
Very good.
Worked just like it should. As expected
Mic did not work.
Works as advertised. Wish the older mounts matched this one so I didn't have to repair boat top rail
"I just got this in the mail today so far I love it, it holds my cell phone up perfectly for viewing for GPS in my car or a movie on my night stand.  Will probably be buying another or maybe a couple more."
Easy transaction with quick delivery. 2 of the 3 were excellent. There was a quick resolve to the one that did not fit. Replacement was very good. Thank you.
It charges my phone perfectly
Robust and so far effective. Excellent guide how to apply it.
I am looking forward to purchasing more ideas for amazon. I love my Galaxy s6 edge case
"Broke within one week, was replaced by Amazon and has been working since (about 3 weeks). Does not seem to be the same quality as Apple, though."
Very dependable case
"Good case and served me well, however, it has essentially fallen apart after 11 months of use.<br /><br />not at all clear how to activate the &#34;lifetime&#34; warranty from amazon."
Love it!
Worked as promissed
It works. Period.
Good durable phone cases and in a timely manner
Works OK but bad closing flap. Doesn't close all the way
Great phone especially for the price.
Does it's job. Nothing special. I use it every day.
Great price on these cables; seems we always need one.
Love this product. Adds all the functionality of Bluetooth enabled car. Only downside is the very loud voice informing me Bluetooth is connected or not. I can see that on my phone and the voice is super loud over my stereo.
"The Xperia Z3 Compact is a flagship level Android smartphone. Build materials are top-notch, and the device is visually elegant. Applications operate with virtually no lag. The camera performs well, although I would have preferred optical image stabilization over digital image stabilization. The battery lasts for about 2 days with WiFi and Bluetooth turned on, and I have managed to go 3 days without charging on some occasions. I use the Sony magnetic charging dock to avoid having to open the micro-usb port cover every time I charge the phone.<br /><br />The first Z3C that I received was a Central American model which unfortunately was defective since the nano-sim slot cover would not stay closed. The second Z3C that I received was a European model. It has been functioning well for 2 months now."
"This was a great buy, have one shorter cable and one longer cable, gives me me more uses."
Best 10 foot Data/Charging cable I have purchased
Love being able to add some fashion to my fitbit.
"for the price, fantastic! only the car charger is a little slow charger not like the original wall charger."
"i bought this when traveling Europe , it performed with excellance ."
"Decent enough, it has come up a bit in one corner and has a scratch on it. Saved my phone from getting that scratch."
This product does not work with the IPhone 5s. Would not recommend anyone buying this product. Amazon's abbreviated return policy does not allow me to return this product even though I am a prime member.
Good quality. I have had two other chargers that got really hot when they charged items. So far I am pleased with it's performance. It does not overheat and I now can plug all my items in at one location.
:)
Love it.. I have it for a month no.. And 100% okay
"Great product overall, I loved everything about the kit with the exception that it cam with a dead pixel. Not super noticeable but none-the-less its still a bummer"
Battery died after one charge only.Useless phone.
"[[ASIN:B00VH8L1U2 Anker [Apple MFi Certified] PowerDrive Lightning 12W iPhone Car Charger with 3ft Lightning Cable for iPhone 6s / 6 / 6 Plus / 5s / 5, iPad Air 2 and more - Retail Packaging - Black]] So far, it works well. But having been stung a few times by car chargers that fail after a few months' use, I am going to wait for at least six months before waxing eloquent about this product."
"I was skeptical at first because of all the generally negative reviews about this mount.  People say it rattles around a lot while riding and they are worried that it might fall off their bike.  All I can say is that it hasn't happened to me yet.  I have the mount stuck to the back of my Lifeproof'd iPhone 6 plus which is basically like riding around with an iPad on your handle bar!  It seems to be working just fine.  After you lock your device into the mount it holds it pretty good,  there is a little slop but it's nothing major.  I ride 12-15 miles per day on paved bike trails, off road single track stuff, gravel roads etc... Point being I ride without a worry that my phone is going to fall off.  Follow the instructions about applying the adhesive and it will work like it's supposed to.  The mount itself hasn't moved from its original mounting position after about 140 miles of use.  I gave it 4 stars just because it is a little sloppy after its locked into place but like I said before it's not enough for me to be concerned.  Overall I am pretty happy with my purchase and I would recommend this mounting system to a friend."
"If you have a motorcycle then this is the one you want.  Before this one I bought an el cheapo plastic one that I didn't even get installed before it broke.  Before I bought it, I noticed one reviewer complained that the rubber grips came off.  I thought that I could just put glue on it if I saw this being a problem.  Well when it arrived, the instructions said to super glue them on if you plan on using the device on a motorcycle or in rough conditions.  I have been riding at 70mph all night and my Samsung Galaxy S5 has not moved an inch.  I have a Galaxy S1 that I will use with it as well.  Will probably buy another one."
"I was using a 2-slot one of these that plugged directly into the wall. Annoying since I have an iPhone, Fitbit and Garmin Fitness Bands. So constantly leaning over to unplug/plug in something. Received one of these and wow! It's very heavy, quality made and comes with a CORD so no leaning over to use it! Works awesome! I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone-, who has just ONE or two items to plug in at a time?!"
meets my needs
"Plastic. Leaves much of the phone exposed. Did not work for me. The ad said rubberized material, I assumed something soft. It feels like hard plastic."
did not receive the tool kit with it just led touch screen should get some money back for the incompetence thank you frank
"Phone case is very thin. It also is very smooth which makes it hard to not drop it every time I pick it up. It is a very cute phone case with a really nice design, but if you're going for something that is both cute and durable, I wouldn't recommend this."
fits great easy to grip. best of all finally a case that covers the stupid apple on back of phone.<br />hate having a window there.
works great and the price is right
Not as I think
"Larger than I thought, but to be able to power items up to a laptop is a fantastic deal here."
Just finished using it while on a trip. Loved being able to keep my tablet operating while in flight.  It also indicates how much power is left.  No guessing game here.  Automatically turns off after using.
"it was a perfect ,great."
looks good. I love it.
Update: died and unfroze and still very impressive.  This is is really cool for the price but cheap. I have had it for three days and not it has froze. I'm gonna return if it doesn't work once it dies.
It feels great in the hand. It protects the phone and screen well while being really slim.
"I was really surprised how much better the tempered glass protector felt over a plastic protector. Since applying this product to my screen, my phone did take a spill and got a hairline crack in the middle, but the phone's screen is fine. The glass is much easier to apply as well than a plastic one and you don't have to worry about dust particles (you still want a clean surface of course) like you do with the plastic. Overall, I am very happy with the product and feel it's well worth the extra cost to protect your screen."
"Does not work, it makes my battery terribly hot & does not charge very well, plus, you cannot use your regular phone cases"
"Nice cover, fits very snug on tablet and love the design.  Good rotation capability, easy to hold.  Shipped quickly in nice packaging."
Big tough cable that won't fray! Well worth the price.
Great...love it.
"So I am pleased with the RAVPower products. I have a solar power panel, and large back up battery, and I have three of these car charges. I am all about RAVPower as much as I am with the Jackery's. None of them have failed me.<br /><br />Every now and then I do have an issue with it charging my Iphone 6 with an OtterBox resurgence, but the mild issues to not match up with the happiness I have with RVAPower. If you do not need more power or an ismart plug, then this is for you. As for me I have found that I need to have that extra juice."
"Short:<br />Charges my Note5 fairly quickly, though not as quickly as a Fast Charge charger. It's cheaper than most others and works well.<br /><br />Long:<br />Charges my Samsung Galaxy Note5 just fine and the pad is almost exactly the same size, which makes alignment quick and easy - just set the phone down and squeeze the sides / line up the bottom edge.<br /><br />Sitting with the charging pad about 3 ft from me, I can hear a quiet, steady 2 bps (beats per second) high-pitched noise - surely the electronics &#34;pinging&#34; for device discovery to begin charging. While audible, it is quiet, steady, and is a tone that doesn't cause me any annoyance.. after a while, I forget it's there, like a fan or other white noise. I probably wouldn't sleep with it on a nightstand next to my bed, but any other use shouldn't be problematic.<br /><br />It's extremely light, which isn't necessarily a good thing. I might prefer some more weight to help anchor the pad in place. The bottom has four tiny corner bumps and being made of relatively cheap materials, the pad isn't absolutely perfectly shaped, so it wobbles from corner to corner on a flat surface ever so slightly. Both of these points are minor and essentially inconsequential.<br /><br />The top isn't non-slip like some others. There's no rubber or sticky silicone on top. That said, I've had no problems and it actually turns out to be a good thing given the way I align my phone as described above. Easy sliding means I can quickly lay my phone down and squeeze the sides to align, as opposed to have to line it up correctly prior to setting it down.<br /><br />The LED is on the &#34;front side&#34; (the bottom, i.e. the side of the pad that faces you) and is bright enough to see, but small enough that it's not obnoxious. It's a steady read and turns steady green when charging. When my Note5 is fully charged, the charging pad remains in charge mode with a green LED. Not a real problem, just pointing out it's not as sophisticated as some of the other chargers available.<br /><br />It charges my Note5 about half as quickly as Samsung's provided Fast Charge wired charger, which is to say this pad actually charges quite quickly compared to what I'd expect for wireless charging. I just set my phone down now: at 65% battery, the phone estimates 60 minutes to 100%. That would be roughly just under 3 hours to go from 0% to 100% if the curve were linear. Samsung's own Fast Charge Wireless Charger claims 0% to 100% in 2 hours, so given that the TechMatte pad is &#34;normal&#34; wireless charging, 3 hours ain't bad at all."
"I am very finicky when it comes to my phone cases. I am very hard on my phone, dropping it at least twice a day. Losing it in the bottom of my purse. Dripping water on it. You name it, I've probably done it. So I need a case that is durable and will at least protect it when I drop it or lose it. When I was offered this case at a free / reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review I decided I had nothing to lose and took the offer. That being said, this case is made of durable, high quality materials. I have dropped my phone and lost it in my purse a few times since getting this case and it has protected it better than I ever thought it would. I was very surprised with this case. The color is fabulous and it fits my phone perfectly. I would definitely recommend this case to anyone who needs a phone case."
It didn't work
"The magnets not the strongest, but other than that its amazing!"
"I bought this in the end of July, and it was expected to be delivered by the end of August. I got it two weeks after buying it  and haven't stopped using it. It works with many different phones/iPods. I haven't found any problems with it. So happy with my purchase. (:"
Exactly what I wanted/needed. Good quality. Everything fits and it looks great.
"Horrible headphones.  No matter which size ear piece I use, they constantly fall out of my ears when exercising.  There is an audible &#34;clicking&#34; noise from one of the earbuds when I run, like one of the mechanisms is loose in there, and it is difficult to establish the bluetooth connection.  I also find that having the control buttons on the ear piece is a total pain in the a$$, as you have to constantly touch your ear to make song and volume selections.  Makes me feel like I'm practicing for the Secret Service.  Hate these headphones and I am going to send them back ASAP.  I guess all the great reviews came from people who got these sent to them for free, like a lot of electronics vendors do on Amazon.  Cheap."
After 2 months stop to work!
"I bought this item because I was looking for something I could use when attending events with family or friends. The set up is really quick with this item and I can't imagine anyone would have trouble using it. What surprised me the most was how sturdy this selfie stick was! I also like that it came with a GoPro compatible attachment. Overall, this is a very nice product if you are looking for a quality selfie stick for a reasonable price. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review."
"Works as expected. I use it in my car, so I can charge multiple devices on the go."
I purchased 2 of these mounts for both of my road bikes and frankly I am VERY pleased with them. I used to have a quad lock previously and I feel this is even sturdier and love that it angles up for using the camera as well. During a local century several riders asked about the mount and seemed to really have lots of positive things to say about it.
Nothing goes wrong with this clear soft rubber case. I love it
Very disappointed.  Sometimes doesn't charge both (case & phone).  Sometimes it will not charge and have to remove case to charge iPhone and case separately.
"The product is just awesome. Shipping and packing were good from the seller's side. The quality of the sound is amazing(perfect mids, lows and bass aswell), it sounds like a high quality branded earphones for the price it is offered. Taking phone calls is a breeze, the call quality through the earphones and the clarity of the microphone is pretty good. It shows the battery bar on IOS (did not try on android). It connects to my PC very well, the Bluetooth connection is strong on both PC and the iPhone. The buttons on the earphones are highly helpful to turn on, turn off, pairing, amswering calls or disconnecting calls, volume +, volume -, changing tracks .............. all of them work really good. I am very much satisfied with the product. CHEERS"
good grip
I love it.
"Great case for my iphone 6. Its not too bulky so I can still get my phone into my pocket or purse. It doesn't add a lot of weight either, only 1.6 oz. It is properly designed so that all the holes line with the phone properly. Most importantly it is a beautiful color. This is case has extra protection on the corners for when you drop your phone. I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review.<br />Comment"
"Does the job, quality is okay"
"Simple, cheap, effective."
I was really disappointed by the volume capability of this speaker. It's not very loud at all. I returned this product.
"Not happy...worked great for the first couple of days, now they don't stay plugged in, keep falling out. Don't want to wiggle around so much so my port doesn't get messed up."
Delivery was perfect and the product is really cool<br />The sale rep was very effective
Great product
Totally awesome deal!!
This case is good for what it is. It doesn't make the phone bulky like some other cases. Just a heads up that there isn't anything to cover the screen itself with this case.
"Not unlocked. Bought it for my son, so it was a while before he completed enough for me to look into the issue. T-Mobile can not send text messages with pictures. They say &#34;downloading&#34; but never do. No Internet either. I called tmobile AND HTC. After those conversations, they said the phone was unlocked incorrectly causing them to not be able to correct the issue. Sansung has awesome low end devices now, so I just went to the tmobile store instead. A deal is rarely a deal, now a days."
Quality is not good and its too big.
I ordered these to install in the front fairing of my Kawasaki Nomad. I wanted to see if I would get a bit more base and directed music flow as indicated in some forum posts out there. I had to trim a bit to have them fit which was OK but otherwise they did nothing to the level or change of the music. Nothing more than molded foam.
I love this product can charge multiple devices and it holds a charge great.  My only complaint is the amount of time it takes to charge the battery if low.  It seems like it takes a long time.  But overall extremely pleased and it is a great value for the money.
Wonderful product
"[[VIDEOID:f2ef858c1586762c334e2029ea27bda3]]I really like this camera an I'm glad I purchased it. With it I can easily record my trips without having to worry about fiddling with buttons. It's probably smaller than you think and isn't easy to spot as long as you don't put it in the middle of the windshield.  It comes with everything you need to put it in your car, including an 8gb micro sd card, a cig lighter adapter, sticky cable holders and two sided tape to stick it to the windshield. Tip: Make sure you choose a location and test it before affixing it to the windshield. There are extras of two sided tape included, but it's a pain to get back off the windshield once it is on there.  The mount is good, but it could be better. It's easy enough to take the camera off of the mount, but if you wanted to put the camera in a different car you'd have to take the two sided tape off of your windshield and the mount and put on a new piece. That's fine though, since I don't plan on using it in another car.  The camera comes with the latest version of the software as of this writing. The manual directs you to mini0806.com, which has one newer update available (5/2015), but when asking SplashETech about this, they said this is the manufacturer site and that updates would be posted to the splashetech.net site, which apparently is no longer their site since the last time I visited it. I have no idea what happened with that, but it looks like the current site is advertising furniture.  The video looks good. I was only able to clearly make out license plates on the highest setting though. The GPS is a nice feature. You can set it to display the speed and coordinates on the video itself along with the date and time. When the sun is at the right angle there is a bit of glare off of the dashboard that is apparently solved with a CPL filter. I see that this is included with some other units. I kind of wish it was included with this instead of the 8gb card, since I probably will not beusing the 8gb card.  At night you can see things, but it's certainly not &#34;night vision&#34; in any sense.  One problem I found is the slot a and slot b functionality doesn't work as intended. From what I gather it's supposed to roll over to the next slot when one card is full. It does not do this though. It'll just remove the oldest files on one card when it is full. If one card is removed, it'll record to the other card. For my purposes a 32gb card is enough for 4.5 hours of video on the second largest video setting, and I really don't need to save more video than that.  Another issue is the manual mentions a &#34;parking guard mount&#34; but it simply isn't available, so there is no true parking mode. You could hard wire into an unswitched power source and just leave the camera on all the time, but that's not really an efficient solution. The option in the menu is supposed to activate recording when a vibration is felt by the camera, but it doesn't look like it works without the mount.  Overall it's a great unit and I would recommend this to a friend. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.  To recap -  Pros:  - Very small, and sleek  - Good video quality on the highest setting  - Firmware seems to be updated regularly (at least on mini0806.com)  - Comes with everything you need  Cons:  - The mount could be better  - Slot A & B functionality doesn't work properly (doesn't start recording to other card when one is full)  - Needs the CPL filter to prevent glare  - No parking mode  Edit: added video of a close call I had. The quality is significantly reduced by Amazon. In the full resolution video I can see the car's license plate."
This Privacy screen guard caused a significant rainbow effect when viewing the screen.  The privacy feature on this had at least a 120 degree viewing angle which is far more than in the product description.  I only kept it on my phone until a different screen protector arrived.
Freaking love it! Not only is it super cute but real protection for my phone. Nice and sturdy as well for those occasions my 3.5 year old snags my phone.
Great. Exactly as pictured.
"I really liked the case. The only problem, I thought i was gonna be the same as the iPhone 4 vans case made out of gum rubber. It was still a great case and everything was great about it!"
"It arrived sooner than expected, it is good quality and I am very satisfied. Would order from them again."
Good items
"This case fits my phone like a glove.  The cutouts for the buttons are perfectly lined up.  It is a little difficult to get off, but if it was loose it wouldn't fit correctly.  I love the pop of color that it gives my phone!  Shipping was quick and easy.  Perfect transaction all around!  Two thumbs up!<br /><br />I received this product as a free sample for my unbiased opinion."
I love it!
Great case. Looks nice on the phone and the look makes it look like there is no case on it. I primarily only by Spigen cases and this is the reason why. On my iPhone I also use a Spigen thin case.
Very satisfied with product and service.
This is not a good product. It will stretch and then if you try to reposition it and you get the tiniest bit of dirt it will not stick.
Work perfectly
BOTH CABLES DID NOT WORK PROPERLY. IT DID NOT CHARGE QUICKLY OR PROPERLY AS THE OEM. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT.
I received a discount for my review of this item. These are the best headphones I have used. They are very comfortable and don't make my ears hurt after wearing them for an extended time. These headphones sound amazing and it was very easy to pair with my phone.
"The case fits well, all microphones have cutouts, it is exactly what I expected."
"Have had Tone Infinim bluetooth for less than 2 months and on/off switch already does not work. Had a short in it, now does not work at all. Hope the 1 year gaurantee is worth something, because its not to Amazon."
The arm doesn't articulate very well in relationship to the handle that opens the clip.
good for price
"I've only had it in for two days, I haven't even dropped the phone and it's already cracked."
"I think this glass looks better than the $20 one I got talked into buying at the Verizon store. That one had broke in about 2 weeks, so I needed a replacement. So far so good. It was super easy to put on my phone. The sticker guides that come with it made it super easy to line up perfectly."
Nice high quality cover for a very smart price!
"I wouldn't recommend dropping your phone in a public toilet, but I did.  I grabbed it quickly, after it totally submerged, and it actually kept working."
"I've used this panel quite a bit now, charging several different devices in several different conditions, and I'm very impressed, for the most part, with its performance. Measuring power output with an in-line USB multimeter showed I was able to squeeze between 8 & 9 watts from it in full sunlight. That's pretty close to its theoretical maximum output of 10 watts from one USB port, (The panel may be rated up to 14 watts, but 10 watts (2 amps x 5 volts) is the most you could possibly get from a single USB port.) and quite comparable to the 2 amp USB wall charger I used as a control. In short, this panel will charge your device just about as fast as most wall chargers--in direct sunlight.<br /><br />Every solar panel's Achilles heel has always been a precipitous drop in power output in cloudy conditions, and the Anker panel is no different. It uses mono-crystalline solar cells, which historically perform better than polycrystalline cells in cloudy conditions. Still, I notice that the power output would often drop to 2 watts or below in anything less than direct sunlight. In stormy conditions, output would drop into the milliwatt range, 250 mw or below. This is still enough juice to trickle-charge most devices, but it will definitely extend the charge time of more power-hungry devices by a matter of several hours. This problem is certainly not unique to the Anker panel, though. Just be aware that, in cloudy weather, you likely won't be charging any large, power-hungry tablets with it.<br /><br />Build quality is very good, from what I could tell. The panels are surrounded in a pretty tough-feeling canvas fabric & held shut by a thick strip of velcro. It has four metal O-rings on Its perimeter, and the USB connections are shrouded inside a pocket which also serves as a convenient place to store your device. The USB ports themselves seem kind of flimsy & loose though, and they don't include a cover to keep debris out when they're not in use. I'd highly recommend keepingthis thing off the ground as much as possible. It's a bit bulky and heavy for the ultra-light backpacking crowd, but then again, I could see this thing easily recharging digital cameras, walkie-talkies, GPS units, smart phones, head lamps and the like, and saving a ton of batteries in the process.<br /><br />The only real complaint I have about this panel is that the box which houses the DC-DC converter and the USB ports gets really hot while in use. This isn't just due to solar heating, as the rest of the panel doesn't get nearly as hot, even after spending several hours in direct sunlight. This has me a little concerned about the longevity of the panel's DC-DC converter. Here's hoping Anker did their homework & designed it to hack high temperatures for hours at a time.<br /><br />One last note: I bought this panel along with Anker's own 16000 mAh Li-Ion battery. [[ASIN:B00N2T7U90 Anker 2nd Gen Astro E5 16000mAh Portable Charger  External Battery Power Bank with PowerIQ Technology 2-Port 3A for iPhone 6 Plus 5S 5C 5 4S, iPad Air, mini, Galaxy S6 S5 S4 S3, Note 4 3 2, Tab 4 3 2 Pro, Nexus 4 5 7 10, HTC One, One 2 (M8), LG G3, MOTO X G, most other Phones and Tablets (Black).]]<br />I found that this battery will stop charging when its input current drops below a set point, and it won't resume charging until it has been physically disconnected and reconnected to its power source. Anker's customer support has confirmed this to be an issue with this specific battery. At this time, I'd recommend going with a different battery, as this one is essentially incompatible with any kind of solar charging, due to this flaw."
Love it. More durable than others I have used.
"Since using PowerBear, my phone periodically reboots without warning as heat of battery causes it to shut down.  Great idea but this has not been product tested enough to be considered as a quality, market-ready product."
This is a useful gadget well worth its low price. It is also well made and comfortable to use. My only concern is its relatively low battery charge.
Great product and fast delivery. Works great!
"I bought Liger wireless bluetooth earbuds earphones for my  gym day.I do like listening music while exercising  but  I always having problem with the other headphones Ive used if not too big or because of the wire and keep distracting me on my exercising.<br />Since I have this Liger wireless bluetooth it solved my problem.This is very comfortable,with control button .<br />I got this product at discounted price."
Wish it had inside pocket
Great bang for youre buck
"Quality screen protectors, priced right."
"I have to say, this product is a amazing. I have been using iCarez products for a few years now and it's never disappointing. The installation was super easy. My tip's on installing is a choose clean room. Pre close the room windows, and doors 1hr before installation, Dust floats everywhere around. So the less you move,and good lighting so you can spot any dust before in the pealing of the installation the better it will go. Mine was 99.9% perfect. I would recommend this product over anything! : )"
I bought this as a gift for my sister. Its affordable and its just a great buy. It comes with the button to take the picture so you dont have to put a timer on the camera. It fits almost every phone as well with the adjustable grasp. It extends long enough to take a group picture as well. I know my sister loved it and shes selfie-ing away!
I love it!
"Very fast charge. Working great so far. If I needed another, this is the one that I would buy."
"Unit works fine but I thought it was the type that plugs directly into the wall instead of via a cable.  Nothing wrong functionally just not as compact when traveling. I kept the product because it does what it's intended, just wish I read more carefully before purchase."
"I only gave these 2 stars because they do not hold a charge for more than 2 hours...  that's very inconvenient since they take so long to charge.  Otherwise they have pretty good sound and a fair range, you really can't get too far from your phone and I found they don't really work with my iPod at all.  Very disappointing!"
Excellent case love it!
Great price
best cord I own hands down! I replaced my phone and ipod cord with this type of cord. long lasting too doesn't rip at top where most cords do
"Fits great, looks sharp."
"If you own an Android phone, buy this. These cords complete quality. The charging heads are very small, so it even fit my gigantic waterproof case.<br />YES, this has 2.1 Amp Charging. Many people who own an Android phone NEED THIS."
Perfect for keeping in the truck. It is about 6 inches long. Let's me charge either my iPhone or my Bluetooth headset while driving. No need for two cables cluttering up my console.<br />Very happy. Price was excellent.
Nice for battery backup
"Love this case!  I was looking to replace my wallet, as I hate carrying both in my line of work.  This case did the trick.  I carry 2 credit cards, my ID, some cash, and my phone.  All my rewards cards, etc. have been replaced by Android apps on my phone.  Convenient!  Love the magnetic strap that keeps it closed.  Seems like this case will last for a while.  Makes the phone significantly thicker when placing calls and having to hold to your ear, but if you use BT headset or speakerphone, it's not an issue at all. Even still, I have made many calls with it being in the case."
Everything was as described. Thanks
Works great. Would give 5 star for customer service!
Awesome product. It comes all together. All you have to do is put your motherboard and parts back in it. You don't have to pull your old home key and buttons off your old phone. I had mine rebuilt in a15-20 mins. I know how to replace my glass but if you don't this is the product for you. Clear brand new looking image. I would give this more stars if I could.
"Fit the Note 3 fine, but doesn't hold a charge any better than the 16 month old OEM battery. Should have paid a little more for a higher quality replacement."
So far so good.. the screen cover does seem to scratch/mar easily though so I don't know how long this will last.. the fingerprint verification still works just fine on the S6 (at least for my wife I seem to have issues probably due to messed up fingerprints on my hands due to constant finger owies)
"I loved it, perfectly fit for my phone."
"Seemed to work well for two days.  Then seemed to be intermittent.  Then stopped charging, although indicator lamp stayed on.  Lamp showed blue constantly once it stopped working."
Fits the phone perfectly. Comfortable and easy to wear.
"Great product, got delivered quickly and with no issues! Highly recommend!"
protects well but kickstand broke in the first 20 mins of use
Product stinks only worked for a short time
"Fixing an iPhone is a nightmare.  This really didn't help at all, but it did give me exactly what I needed to fix it and for a fair price."
Brought an old unit back to life.
thanks
This is a wonderful can the Samsung Galaxy Note 3. It really protect the phone in it entirety. The only thing this case is missing is being waterproof. That would make the case even better
Not very good quality
Fits my 4s extremely well. I have the clear version and it is not cloudy. Feels solid.
"DO NOT BUY!!! This charger was connected to my phone one night and for some reason it heated up the USB cable so much that all the plastic melted off the cable and the port ended up warped and melted. Clearly it is missing either basic protection from dangerous conditions such as shorts or there is a major quality control problem. I will never trust this brand to charge my phone safely again, since they almost caught my bedroom on fire!!"
Good product but no instructions for installing screen protector.
"Even though it's rubber and flexible, it fits like a glove and protects the iPod!"
"Perfect smartphone. Bit large for first time users but once you get used to it, you can't look back. The QHD screen is a treat to the eyes. The icons and text look amazingly clear. Amoled screen makes it even better. The camera quality is great as well. The body of phone is very appealing, with metal edges. I bought two of them. One white 64gb and the 32gb blue. The new updated price of Nexus 6 is more apt. I bought the Nexus 6 64gb at the original price of 699$ which i now believe was overpriced for it.<br />Nexus always has an advantage of getting first updates from Google, that is always a plus."
What sicko would buy this?
"Very thin and decent coverage of curved edges of the iPhone.  But, bubbles at edges, visible mostly with black faced phones, hardly visible with white, but still there.  First one is inevitably for practice that you won't like and will remove so, if it's your first purchase, it's really buying a single screen protector.  Not sure how long it'll last, and worried about the bubbles at the edges catching dust or pulling off the screen."
"The phone itself fits my phone perfect, but the picture on it isn't the best. You can see the lines from the printer and it's not as clear as I was hoping for."
Works great!
Bought it for the wife to use on her iPhone 6+.  She LOVES it!
Garbage.  Seller finally contacted me after the 4th email to them.  Amazon already refunded me 100 percent so I threw this thing in the trash.  What a waste of time
"This is the lousiest transmitter I've ever bought.  Battery life is very short, and it doesn't pick up even the best stations.  Very fuzzy music.  Wish I hadn't thrown my paperwork away, Id return it."
"I played with the phone for a couple of hours after we go it activated on the carrier.  It kept showing the Eastern time zone and would not change the date format per the system settings.  After adding the Google account, it would not update the contacts or calendar.  Finally, it kept giving me an error when I tried to update the software.  For a few dollars more, you can get one of the other Dash line like &#34;C Music&#34; which I had no trouble with."
Really bad. After a week of being used the front casing of the charger came off exposing the wiring. After 3 days the wires were damage. Don't buy this.
Great product. . Great sound quality. I can hear text and and respond to it with my headphones as well as take calls which comes in handy when I'm at the gym. Little snug at first on the ears but it's good now. Great battery life. Highly recommend
Superb quality!
"It is very cute, but does not stay on. It actually dropped out of the case and the screen cracked as a result."
"Often the detector doesn't go off when you think it should (when you come into contact with patrols on the freeway). I drive by an airport every day and the detector doesn't go off until it is right next to the radar, seems like it would recognize it further out especially such a strong signal. Regardless, ran up on a radar gun today (on opposite side of freeway) and the detector never alerted me. Again seems like it would have triggered an alert. My friends had one over 15 years ago that seemed to work better. For reference the detector was mounted level at the highest point on my windshield. Albeit I have limited experience with radar detectors.  You need confidence in a detector and I don't have any in this model."
Greatness!
Came quickly and great feel. Will buy again in other colors.
i love the colors but it doesnt fit on my phone and it really annoys me so i wouldn't buy another one of these cases again
"I had a problem with the holster where the end broke shortly after I purchased the product. I notified the seller and they were very professional. They replaced the holster with no additional charges. I do recommend that any individual purchasing this product to be cautious with the holster. If the phone is not attached, the ends of the hoster can catch on to the ends of desks, chairs, etc when you stand from a seated position. Other that that, I am fairly satisfied with the product, and my purchase experience with the seller."
Just got as a &#34;just under casr&#34; part in case the one on by Samsung Galaxy S5 should  break.  Price was excellent and shipment arrive in great condition.
Spend the money and get both the Portable charger and RAVPower Solar Charger well worth the money.<br />I used the portable charger the entire weekend.  I charged it up on Friday morning and charged 3  I-pads and 3  I-phones each getting 3+ charges over the three days.  Still has one power bar here on Sunday night.
This ninja kitten is sooo cute. He looks just like my sister's new kitten which makes him even cuter in my eyes. The phone jack is tiny (a lot smaller than what the picture make it seem) but that adds to the cuteness factor. It is not bulky and does not get caught on anything due to its small size.
Great product
"Great product.  Has a little trouble switching between phones, but purchased two"
Bought for spare earpiece. Like the headset so now I can replace the part that takes the most abuse.
Worth the money
"It does not stick to my dash at all.  I was looking forward to this working great, but I put it in, and the next thing I know, my phone falls under my gas pedal.  Thank goodness I hadn't left my driveway yet."
Terrible!!!!!!  You cant see the screen if the sun is shining.  I had to reset it so many times because it would go blank or freeze.  It was so aggravating.  If my child wouldnt have thrown away the box It would be sent back ASAP
It was great and everything I expected... and arrived right on time.
If you like looking at a dust ring on your screen by all means buy it. The fact that they left the circle hallow is a fail. A thin sheet of plastic on the circle would of made the case perfect.
Nice phone.  It does all I need.
Case has help up really well over the last few months!
best charger cables I've ever purchased. Charges phones quickly and is very durable. I will buy more of these soon.
"Fits the phone perfectly and has done it's job so far.<br />Have trouble getting the case off, but I don't need to do that often so it isn't a true issue."
"The product works really well, as long as I kept it plugged in to charge. Unplugged, there was a lot of interference. Still, that's a small problem and overall I am very happy with it. Sadly, it started acting up after about a month of use. However, the customer service completely made up for it, replacing the product without complaint. I'm extremely satisfied and would definitely buy products from them again."
"Worked for a month before it fell apart.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />I had originally voted this product one star, but shortly after I was contacted by anker and they offered me either a different unit or a refund. I chose the refund and the process couldn't be better. They emailed me at every step of the way and completely managed my expectations. I got a notification when- my request was received, when it was sent to amazon, when it was approved by amazon and I got notifications from amazon along the way as well. Got my refund within days. I would deal with this company again.<br />Side note- I have a portable battery from them and it works like a charm."
"The color of the device itself is beautiful, I think the pink color is even more vibrant than you really see in the picture.<br /><br />Sadly to say, within 10 minutes of opening the package, I noticed a defect and will be returning this item. The soft material on the inside of the arm band is already peeling off.<br /><br />I purchased this based off of other reviews for people with a OtterBox case. I have an iPhone with an OtterBox commuter series case. I had my phone in the armband and when I got a phone call, I tried to quickly pull the phone out and it was neither quick or easy with the OtterBox case. If you were going to use the armband specifically with headphones that have a microphone this may be easier for you, but I don't use headphones with my phone."
This is simply the best selfie stick that I have ever had. All the other previous three failed my expectation. This one has exceeded my expectation with handy design and reliable blue tooth connections.
"amazing prices and products. I needed this, and I couldn't get a better price with their promo code in exchange to leave a  review!"
"What an awesome, affordable product. Comfortable and do not fall out during physical activity. Just put these to the test during my run and they're so ideal that it would be ridiculous to throw your money towards something more expensive and unnecessary.<br /><br />For the price, these have a great sound, great battery life, and are extremely comfortable and don't fall out!<br /><br />Buy these now!"
"I bought this case for my wife's phone when we both upgraded our phones to the Edge+.<br />I had no trouble installing this case on her phone, other than it being a rather tight fit.<br />Once installed, it fit like a glove.  It has nice rubber sides contributing to a good sense of security the phone won't slip out of her hands.<br />The &#34;sparkles&#34; on the case are all recessed so it doesn't interfere with it laying flat.<br />My wife absolutely loves this case, and so do I, knowing her phone has a good degree of protection.<br />Great case, and highly recommended!"
"Shipped fast, came with a resealable pouch to protect it, works great."
Handle did not correctly line up with button once opened. You get what you pay for.
Pretty good quality. About the sound you would expect from this price but no problems with it at all.
Bought one of tbese from a local audio shop. BANGS. i highly recommend this sub.
Great USB Battery and wonderful value!
I'm pleased with my purchase.
I love it because it has a good price and a good quality.
"This is a great looking cell phone case, but it`s more for a woman than a  man. That`s the only reason I couldn`t use it, otherwise it is made well."
Great product!!! Stops charging on occasion
These are high quality. Remember that on all newer cars with factory alarms/keys that have transmitters within the key. You will need a bypass module. Evo All is my choice for high quality. Made in Canada. Take your time to install neatly and you will be very happy.
"great and all, but collecting dust under it already"
"Got this screen protector so in case he drops his phone it is protected. Love the screen, easy to put on."
The case fits over the phone buttons so you can't use it. I ended up going case-free.
"this phone is no good ,memory card is all screwed up an other things on it"
Exactly what you want if you are looking to protect but add as little bulk as possible to an iPhone 6+.  Perimeter is rubber and stands about 2 or 3 mm above screen. Back is harder plastic. Might not save you from a 5 story drop but should save screen from the shattering from the face diwn drop on the garage floor.
Not a lot of volume from this. Save your money.
"Good buy, works as stated."
Great case I love the kick stand very sturdy also
"Great bundle of cords to color code where and how they are used.  All of the cords I have tried so far work.  My biggest disappointment was that unlike the variety of colors shown in the picture, I received five yellow, three pink and two blue.  Not much variety."
Very happy with purchase!
Couldn't get it to charge. Need refund info
good!
fits really nice and secure
"Arrived very quickly, very nice quality.  I would order again."
"LOVE this case!!! Arrived on time, as promised. Fits my LG G3 like a second skin. My fire red phone looks beautiful and shiny, and totally protected. For screen protection I added a ballistic glass screen protector and now my new phone is safe . . . AND GORGEOUS!"
These are really good for the price. Cannot complain.
Got this for international travel and absolutely loved it! It's also a nice thing to have in emergency situations when the power goes out.
Cheaply made rubber like outer covering. Would prefer the thicker PVC vinyl covering which is smooth and easier to handle.<br />Will not re-order.
"Should fit any S4 variant EXCEPT the S4 Active. Should not matter if you have the T Mobile, Verizon, Sprint, or AT&T model in the US or the international model elsewhere. All of the S4's (Except the Active) were built on the same form factor.<br /><br />The purple battery doors were a special version available for the Sprint model. Now all the extras are showing up for retail to anyone.<br /><br />I have the purple door on my T Mobile version S4. Fits fine. Works fine."
"Excellent product, fast shipping!!!"
Like
SUPER cute and fast shipping. Thank you!!
"Unfortunately these are not working for me. They did charge just fine but will not connect to the bluetooth on my iPhone 6. Granted I did purchase them on sale but I did so because I do not need anything fancy, just something to allow me to listen to music etc while I am out for my morning walk. These are going back."

I am very satisfied with Birugear 4Pcs Stylus/styli Touch Screen Pen.  I will recommend Birugear 4Pcs Stylus/styli Touch Screen Pen to anyone.  The pens are very good to work with.  I ordered a different name brand a few weeks ago which was cheaper - well you get what pay for.  The tips of the pens were so soft they were had to us.
"Nice case.  covers well, like small fabric styrofoam.  Shockabsorbent.  You can record while it's it in if you have a microphone."
Nice product very good and prompt delivery will buy from 5his seller any time
The car charger never worked.
Ordered this for my son (16yo); he has had it now for several weeks.  Strong construction and durable to offer the protection a 16yo needs for a phone.  He says it is working great for him.
"Poor construction, the clear piece separated from the side molding from everyday use.  The case lasted me a couple of months at most.  Will not recommend to purchase this case."
Love it
So far great. We have old worn out car jacks. The average converter doesn't make contact well so tried this one it looked larger. It feels larger and better made. I've tried it in two of the worn jacks and it really works great. Constant contact better charge.
Have purchased a few of these and have had no problems with any of them. Highly recommend. NOTE: the plastic on the lightning end is wider than Apple cord so it doesn't fit in the slot of my husband's Otterbox Defender case but fits mine (not Otterbox) just fine.
The reason I gave this such a low review is for a major flaw that it has. The charging cable does not line up flat with the hole where the watch rests. This decreases the magnetic connection strength and ultimately causes the watch to fall off and lose its charge.
Perfect for my needs. Now I can keep my life proof case on.
I really like this product. Holds my phone nicely. I like the swivel feature.
"While USB-C is not a brand new port type, it has recently become popular with the emergence of the new Apple MacBooks. This adapter makes it possible to use standard USB devices and cables with the USB-C input port. I tried this out with several USB cables and didn’t have any problems with a good connection.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&#34;"
It works perfectly.  I love it.  delivery was quick and I am fully satisfied.
"The case fits well on the phone and looked great when I first put it on. However, after only 2 weeks of use (my phone is carried in my purse and has bever been dropped) it looks pretty scratched up and the textured soft finish is wearing off. The exterior finish had not held up well to minimal use and I'm very disappointed in this purchase."
Didnt work when i got it...
I'm sorry to inform you that I'm planning on returning this item due to the fact that I haven't been able to pair it to two different phones. Thanks.
"I just bought a new battery for my Samsung S5 and then the old battery just died on me.. So, now that was no longer my back up, but my full time battery. I noticed my phone dying half way through the day, and didn't think I would stay with Samsung. (I don't like that you can't change out the battery anymore, or add SD card) So I didn't want to buy something only compatible with Samsung. So I purchased this so I can use it with any of my electronics in need of a charge. It works great, and is pretty fast."
worked fine little while then after 5 months my phone stopped charging the battery then started getting the gray battery of death put back in the oem battery went away.  The phone simply stopped recognizing the battery   (Update july 5th 2016) they sent me a replacement battery same thing happened all over again phone will recognize the oem battery but not the Rav power battery

Excellent  very  satisfied
fantastic transition from the Nexus 5 phone. Great phone.
One of the earpieces broke within a week of receiving it!
Love the cover!
"I purchased one and liked it so much, I purchased another one for my husband as well :)"
Great!
Even better than I expected... and fast delivery.
Good charge extension for phone. Buttons pop off if it drops to hard and makes the phone a little difficult to use
"Ok, so the original unit I got had some problems, I had trouble with ports randomly not charging a device, but I found I could swap two devices and charging would resume...  I posted my experience on Amazon.  Anker customer support actually contacted me by e-mail and phone, and sent a replacement unit.  Changing this to 5-star because their customer support is fantastic."
Cord is thin and already has a shortage. When it works it charges well but when it doesn't it's useless.
I am confused about calculating a route. It tells me there are sections that the motorhome cannot travel yet it apparently does not route around those sections. I do like all of the motorhome features that are built in. I have not used it to go on a trip yet.
I love this phone case for my phone. Its very simple but it gets the job done.
Great price and charges well
"SORRY, I read the reviews and really wanted to like it, the materials seemed ok, just did not like the fit much. Still prefer my OB commuter and Defenders for S5/6 models. Not being a hater, just did not work for me, sent back for full and ez refund. :)"
"These are AWESOME! I go through the soft, foam ear pads in a matter of weeks, but I have had these for a year and a half now and they are still going strong - not even a crack in the soft, leather-like material! Very durable, and does nicely keeping the sound out. Well done!!!!"
Thank you for this great product. Item was as described and I still have it on my phone.
"This got stuck in the sim card slot on my Samsung Galaxy S4 and the slot broke while trying to get it out, basically making my phone useless. Luckily I managed to order a replacement sim/sd card slot and fix it myself (only losing the back and options key in the process), but most mobile repair shops would not even attempt the repair and others charged more than the value of the phone for it.<br /><br />Save your phones and don't buy this."
Awesome case
Nice
saves the kids phones
My daughter loved this.  Thank you for shipping it in time.
I love it sounds great
"Very nice quality, slim profile phone wallet.  Great to carry with you when you need to make a quick run to pick up the kids or go to the grocery store.  Description is very accurate.  Fits I-Phone 6 perfectly.  Can easily hold two credit cards, driver's license, and dollar bills.  The wrist lanyard is an added plus.  Case appears to adequately protect I-Phone. Love the magnetic closure securing contents inside. I am definitely pleased with this item.  I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
It's a very good pole. Fits my daughters iphone5 and she loves it. It stretches out far and it seems sturdy and well made.
Love 'em.
Awesome. Works good and great price.
"Like at least one other reviewer I experienced a very concerning issue of overheating during charging. I had plugged it into a USB adapter (the one that came with my iPhone) and left it for several hours.  I got back some hours later to find the headset extremely hot; also the charger was hot, as was the USB cable.<br /><br />Following this the headset will not power on and the plastic casing (right side, where the battery apparently is) is distorted from the heat.<br /><br />It had successfully charged about three times previously (via a USB port on a laptop, versus the Apple adapter).  Total usage about 6 hours within one week; now it is in the trash.<br /><br />Shockingly bad, not to say possibly dangerous."
Really nice and usable. Thanks
Tiny but powerful
"This case is awesome. My wife got upset with me and threw my phone across the parking lot, the phone bounced off the ground a few times and I thought for sure it was going to be broken...not a scratch or a cracked screen. I've had this case for about a year now, dropped the phone many times, still in perfect condition"
I received a discount on my order for a fair review
"This is an absolutely gorgeous case. My hubby has been whinging about having a hard time finding a cool case for his LG, and this one fit the bill. He likes that he can get it in a color besides black ( I picked out the blue for him). You don't have to put this on your phone as a whole new case, your phone just pops right in. It's sturdy and withstands some pretty bad drops- he's a klutz- it went down the stairs last night and his phone is just fine. LG's have the most dainty little screens- they will shatter if you look at them funny, so that was pretty impressive. It sticks to his magnetic car mount and will stay open if you want to use it as a kickstand. The quick circle opening is great, you don't have to open the case when you want to check the time or see who's calling. It also has a handy dandy slot for your ID or credit card so you can take just the necessities when exercising or walking the dog or whatevs.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount necessary to facilitate my honest review. No other forms of payment were or will be received."
It has nothing to envy of any mid-range phone . In my opinion many opt for this because of its excellent specifications and price.-
"An excellent product , marked it easy to hold this phone without hurting your fingers"
Did not fiphone. To big.
Great backup for when AC isn't available. This battery will recharge an iphone6+ several times. It is heavy.
Does not work.  Can't change the channel.  I am sending it back.
"Legit company, legit battery"
It's not like the original back prongs are to big
Works very well and length is perfect! Very pleased
very nice item
Works as intended. Can't ask for more.
"Awful, Awful, Awful.  Do not buy.  We have had 3 now and all of them broke or stopped working in very short time."
"I had begun dropping my iPhone more regularly lately and was looking for a more sturdy case, but I didn't want something too overwhelming.<br /><br />The i-Blason case fits my needs perfectly. It is reasonably priced, goes on very snugly and doesn't interfere with my use of the phone.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend it."
Works great. Not a single problem.
"Use this for my Note 5. Charges at a good rate, works great."
It's super fun I just wish it were more useful and protected my phone more. I wish it had bumpers for the screen. I switched this cover out for a two part ultra-protection case and I noticed a dramatic change in protection.
"wanted a design without a closure, however the leather started wearing after 3 months.  In my opinion, overpriced for overall quality."
Didn't care for it so much. I think any case ruins the aesthetic of the phone itself.
"Great, good seller."
Love these! Great price and I change them up all the time
Aw vice was great. Received package in a timely manner. Thanks so much!!
"First one I received didn't work at all.  The second one works, but it sounds like gears are grinding when the face plate opens. The SD card slot wont recognize any memory greater than 4 gig.  The USB socket doesn't recognize my Android phone. Not even worth $100."
"Good product, highly recommended"
"This is the 3rd time I have purchased the SwitchEasy Numbers case. It provides just enough protection without adding too much bulk to the iPhone 6+.  And it's the only case I know of that covers the power and headphone ports - important for me because I carry my phone in my pocket and the covers keep the lint out.  A little extra work when you want to charge your phone or connect to your car stereo, but totally worth it!"
"I really liked the wire tool, i hadn't thought to use something like that before. The glass is plenty firm. Might help if it said which side of glass was front but it doesn't take much effort to flip it a second time without the glue/gel sticking to the glass... my bad on that part haha."
Clip is a little stiff so is hard to get off my pocket part time. Otherwise works great.
Perfect for slim fit protection.
"I LOVED THEM! Yes, LOVED, I lost them at school a couple of days ago, it hurt so much I actually had a dream where I found them. They looked nice, and had a great sound for the price, definitely recommend them, it's a shame I lost them, excellent quality for its price."
This product was provided for a unbiased review.<br /><br />[note]<br />I was talking to the company for about a month trying to get the light adapter the sent me the wrong one a few times. But there lovely support time helped me and got me the peace I need.<br /><br />[packing]<br />This product came in a very well cushioned package and did not have any issues with it being damaged. But also I do feel they could have done a better job packing it but it's ok.<br /><br />[design]<br />This has a really nice look to it its one of the thinnest Wallet battery packs I could find. But sadly it will not fit in my wallet fits amazing in my pocket tho can't even feel it. The front has 4 blue LEDS that will like up to show you the battery percentage<br /><br />[battery]<br />This charger will hold 2000mah and it does amazing for a backup charger. I keep this In my back pocket if my iPhone suddenly dies on me. And it works amazingly<br /><br />[charging]<br />So this has a very unique way of charger. It uses to male ends and connects on them the to a USB to charger it's very different then other ones I have seen but it works! Also yes it's supposed to come with a 8-pin Lightning cable<br /><br />Overall this is a amazing charger and would recommend to any buddy who need a quick pocket battery!<br /><br />If you have any questions please feel free to a ask me in the comments<br /><br />Once again this Product was provided for a honest I'm unbiased review.<br /><br />-Hunter
This battery fit and functioned very well.
I would not recommend this cable.  I just recently started using it - probably 2 or so weeks now - and the fabric covering is falling off the cord. Not worth it.
"Update 11/2: I dropped my phone pretty bad with no case on and I got two hairline scratches across the phone and when I removed the screen protector there wasn't any damage on the phone!<br />I am so happy to switch from a plastic protective firm to a glass protector. I had a misconception that glass screen protectors had a complicated application process, however applying a glass protector isn't different from applying a plastic screen protector. I say it's a must have for the chance that I could drop my phone and the screen protector would take all the damage and the screen protector would pay for itself. I like how the protector doesn't change the clarity or feel of the LG G3 screen. Plus, this screen protector covers the bottom bezel which makes the screen protector less noticeable.<br />*Sample provided for review. I was not compensated for a positive review."
Great price. Prompt shipping.
Great battery for the price
Love it!!!! Made my phone still look thin and classy!
Works fine. No problems at all
Blocks outside noise completely and you can turn it up really loud. They fit comfortably and the charge doesn't take long if you leave it there for an hour or so. Connecting it is a piece of cake and they're just awesome.
good
Broke fast
Just what I needed. Great value.
Goes on very easily and stays in place. So far it saved my screen from a really nasty damage so i can safely say that this product can withstand cosmetic stuff due to regular wear.
really does work!
Not good doesn't charge phone.
"Sturdy, durable case. Love how thick the screen protector was. I've dropped my phone 200 times and the case and screen protector has withheld it!!"
It was a perfect fit and great price!
The belt clip part broke 2 days after I got it
Great n long enough
Aweosme HD quality car cam a must buy and it has a very good wide angle. I have tried many dash cams and this one seems to hold out with the insane desert heat here in Vegas.
"After some experimentation I'm finding that vertical, nylon holsters work best for me and this is an especially well made one.  The horizontal leather (or leather like) holsters I've purchased have fallen apart at the belt loops or elastic.  I didn't want the hook & loop closure  on this one but it is more secure and a good trade-off.  Plus my Galaxy S5 fits well even with a protective case on it."
Did its job with no problems
"One of the corners doesn't completely close, other than that, it does what a shell should do."
Cheaply made and broke a few weeks after having it.
Well made product which is working well so far!
100% satisfied
Love the length of the cords and works really well. I would defiantly suggest other people to buy this product.
Works great & phone fits fine.
"Fantastic.  These have good range, come in variety of different colors, and come with a convenient key chain tag.  I use them with Tasker / Trigger app combination on my android device.  Love how efficient my device has become because of them!  Turns menial, sometimes-tedious, tasks into an even simpler tap of your device."
long and nice color
"Nice price. Shipping is high, but understandable in exchange."
This v.very bad Item i lost my iphone6 because of this case it says it water proof but in fact its not i was using it less than 1 meter for 3 min and all water inside so really if u wanna lose ur iphone buy this product im so angry
Very well made - very happy with t his product!
item is scratch
"I would give this item a 5 star rating if it supported 128 GB (or larger) MicroSDSX cards.  A 64 GB card can record just over 6 hours in High quality (higher than 1080P), which is great.  But it would be great to be able to double that for those really long road trips!<br />Otherwise, I'm totally impressed with the image quality and ease of use of this camera.  It's got a great wide angle view and records well in both light and dark conditions!  Give us a firm-ware update that supports 128 GB cards and I'll re-rate with a 5-star!"
"The case fits perfectly all the way around. Even the charger fits with no obstruction of the case. The rubber and the plastic combo feels good in my hands. The only negative is the kickstand which feels flimsy but it works good. Just don't put to much pressure while using the kickstand, it might brake."
"Works like a charm, remember folks, update update update."
"Perfect fit.  Took me all of about 5 minutes, maybe even less, to install.  I have no idea how my son managed to break the original."
"This case is awesome it take a couples of times to mess with it but this case works fine charges my phone to 100% in a couple of hours ,also the seller has great customer service so he's very well a great seller"
I love it!!!
Great price and product.  It works...charges my iphone and ipad without any issues.
"Beware if you think this is simply the micro SIM required for many GSM phones---it isn't.  The nano and adapters do not work in all phones (they get stuck).  And Cricket and the Gamestop stores that sell these have no clue about any of this.  Considering that the individual sim cards probably cost them a few cents a piece, I think it's ridiculous they don't instead include 3 sim cards, not 1 and an adapter.  They seem surprised to hear that nobody carries the individual micro sims any more, and when I finally did aquire one (off amazon no less) it would NOT connect.  They had no clue how to help me regardless of the number of rounds I went to them via phone, store, and online chat.  They finally threw their hands up in confusion.<br />They seem polite, but efficient and professional?  On that they get an 'F' !"
"The case fits my phone well. I was bike riding, my phone dropped face down in the street, and survived with no damage. I was impressed!"
It worked for 2 hours only. It wouldnt charge and I had to return.
Fast delivery by seller and excellent product. Works great and easy to adjust.
great product as usual
LOVE these headphones - highly recommend!
"Great headphones, my 6yr loves them."
"This case so far has been great for my phone. The owl design is extremely cute and it looks great on my phone. However, I do agree with the other reviews saying it is hard to get on. I didn't have too many problems getting it on my phone, but after trying to take the case off my phone (thinking that I had put it on the wrong way) I could not get it off. I tried using a pen which didn't work, but after reading a review about scissors I may have to try that. I think this case is very durable and keeps my phone safe, but it is extremely difficult to get off your phone. I would recommend it, but with caution."
Brought this for my daughter and she loves it. Haven't had any problems with it. Able to load over 40 games with no problem and still have over 1gb left. The issue so far is finding a good case.
Absolutely love it! This summer was one of the best thanks to this protection! I wish I would of bought it sooner
The case protects my phone well and I have dropped it like 6 times and it looks in great condition. And plus is the ports ar protected. It comes with a screen protector which is super easy to install if you are unsure just look at YouTube videos on how to place it without any bubbles. The only con is the ports get dusty. And I don't like that the apple symbol is exposed like it's not really necessary.
"order wrong part, never got to use it. It was what was on the sight"
great fits my Golf VII perfect
My daughter loves it i would buy more if i had to
This made it easy to repair my broken charger door!
Only shows 0.31 amp and takes ages to charge 1%. This is worse than my cheap old ($1.00) charger. False marketing
[[ASIN:B00F3583S8 Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Standard Battery]]<br /><br />The battery doesn't work and it looks like a used one.  Don't buy it from the dealer I pasted here.  It's a scam.
Good GPS. I needed it for both US and canada and it works. The traffic informations give you the right indications to avoid traffic on your way.<br />Need to buy new maps for my next trip in Europ. Gonna see if it's working then.
Hole for the camera is too small.  When you take night photos the flash bounces off the case and ruins the photo.<br />Chinese Junk.
Awesome quality
"It came on time just as promised. It is a great protector for my phone. My one gripe is also the best feature. I am glad that the phone grips the case, but that also makes it difficult to get the phone out quickly. With the phone gripping the case so tightly you know it won't fall out. With the stands to prop it up on flat surfaces that just makes this the best product for the HTC Desire 526."
"I have trouble with Bluetooth earpieces and never finding a comfortable fit.  I have always tried the on ear headphones or the ear buds.  This is my first in ear Bluetooth earpiece. I found this ear piece to be comfortable and easy to use, it doesn't bother me as much as I had expected it to.  It pairs really easily with my iPhone 6.  I just pressed the button on the Bluetooth in ear head piece for a few seconds, saw the flashing red and blue lights and I was able to see the device was detected by my phone.  Once I successfully paired it to my device, I haven't had to pair again since.<br /><br />I had to test it to see the sound and how well it worked, since some Bluetooth headsets give an echo.  This headset did not give me any echoes when using it.  You answer the call by simply pressing the button on the head piece.  I had no static with the device and has a crisp and clean sound when using it.  I experienced no issues with the headset and I was able to walk away from my phone for about 15 feet before starting to experience some slight static and interference with the headset.  I don't normally walk away from my device while using it, but its nice to have the option and knowing that the caller on the other end will still be able to hear me well and vice versa.<br /><br />This headset comes from chin,  so it is equipped with voice prompts in English as well as Chinese.  Since I don't speak Chinese, I do not use that feature and stick to the English language.  To switch languages, hold the button down and it will switch languages.  The device also has a pleasantly long battery life.  I have used it numerous times without needing to recharge.  I also don't use it very often which would account for the long battery life.  Overall, this headset performs as expected and is also undetectable with my hair down.  Its a well made ear piece that I got in nude.<br /><br />Complimentary sample provided in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
This product is very handy when it comes to charging. The company makes sure that if there are any issues with the product in which they produce they try and fix it right away.
It took a long time to get it but once we did my son loves it.
"Buyer beware. I loved these AT FIRST.  Slowly after a couple of months, the pairing became more difficult.  I'd have to forget the headphones and restart/reboot my iPods and iPhone every time.  This becomes frustrating.  It's shortened my workouts because sometimes it takes 15 minutes.  Today, it's been almost 30 minutes.  I threw them away in frustration.  Sadly, I bought my niece a pair right before all the problems.  I hope she's one of the lucky ones.  Is it worth $20 for something that might only work 3-4 months? Your call."
Cannot charge with it . For some reason does not charge
"delivered on time, works as described.  Use it for Apple products...."
Good piece
just as described.  arrived like 2 weeks before the delivery date provided
Very nice
Easy to assemble and mounts in seconds. Holds my iPad very securely
Great case. Works as advertised.
"I received this case as promised.  I love, love it.  It fits the phone like a glove, top quality through and through.  I love the color, the look and the feel. I have several cases for my phone but this one is in a class by itself."
Meet or exceeded as advertise
I like it. It covers my headphones jack and charger port . But not the speakers. Pretty hard too open and put it on.
did not used it and returned because flimsy
"Solid arm band, a bit big for my I phone 5, but definitely get the job done"
"Beautiful, plan to order another one."
"There's no question that Otterbox is superior, but the contrast between the medium and dark blue is awesome. It arrived very quickly and I am very satisfied."
Product was shipped already broke. Cheap plastic. I wouldn't trust it to protect my phone.
Fits great
Came with everything except the sticky seal needed to keep the screen in the case (and not dangling out).  I would recommend you find another supplier who included that seal.
Excellent
Just as advertised
My first order was a product that simply did not work.  They resent me the product and only one USB outlet work.  I am stuck with it now.  I am not happy about it at all.  The price point of this product makes it useless to fight any further about it.
good except i wieh it had magnetic latch as some do
"Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended."
Yes I am happy with it
I have had no problems with my purchase. I am a very happy customer. Would definitely buy again.
There was a crack when i got it but it doesnt matter i still love the case.
Great tool added to our team.  Communication is a dream now and we do not have to use our employees personal cell phones.  GREAT TOOL!  Thank you.
Great service. Good product.
repeatedly turns on and off.
"So far so good. No screen sensitivity issues. Installed very easy. For a $16 tempered glass screen protector, especially for the 6 edge, it's a great product. I recommend."
Nothing like what u see online wish I never purchased it
Very good
This case would be great if it had not broken within a couple of weeks. The case and holster both are broken. I am not rough on phones at all and this said it was the armor series case. The plastic is very thin and cheap. I would not recommend this case to anyone.
muy buen producto
Awesome  product! Doesn't look bulky in the car...
Great
Instructions suck. Why don't you give a brake down of the screen anatomy. I took mine apart according to your instruction and there is another layer your guitar wire was a bad choice as the physical characteristics tend to gravitate to the wrong layer and Your instruction says to start at the top near the microphone with knife graduating to guitar wire. When that is where the digitizer harness is. Very dangerous. Are you guys affiliated with cell phone scrap and recycle?
"Excellent quality, far better value than I could find in any of the big stores."
Great
Very pretty I liked it very much came right away
"Excellent product, quality color monitor including night vision at a bargain basement price.  The only downside is when mounting to the license plate, the width partially covers the existing inspection stickers.  Installation was a challenge, more so for my Toyota 4Runner then with the VW Jetta.  My first thought was to use Geek Squad but I decided to do it myself.  About 2 hours for each vehicle to get connected to power and cable run to the receiver.  The video cable wasn’t long enough for either vehicle so I purchased 15 ft cables with adaptors.  You’ll may also need additional power cable depending on where you tap the reverse sensor cable.  Great product, great price and I would highly recommend."
Love it.
"Nice looking case, hard but soft, but the painting in the hard case start to scrape off a bit, no big deal, i love my case"
Perfect
Exactly what I wanted and the price is great.
"This is just what I was looking for to use in my charging valet. Very nice quality, works great and some of the most Apple-like packaging I have seen"
I love my new case. It is exactly as advertised and expected. thank you
Nice value. Protects the screen well. Delivered quickly.
Poor quality and dont stay or fit in my ears.
Excellent product!!!
Exactly what i needed. Thanks!
I feel confident if I dropped my phone in this case (which I have done accidentally) it will protect it.
Exactly what I wanted
Love the cover but wish picture was clearer as it is a blurred pic.
"The other reviews are SHILLS. Check the favorable reviews: They were compensated for a good review. This item would not hold my phone for any longer than 60 seconds, and then it would fall off. I can just imagine how many people bought this expecting it to hold their phones up only to have them fall down, fall out of the car, and hit the concrete and shatter.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK."
"I received a free item to review.<br /><br />A lot of so-called athletic/exercise headphones claim to be sweat-resistant  but  the reality is their thin cords, lightweight and exposed cushions and controls  start to break down  -or get smelly-funky – fast, especially in warmer weather.<br /><br />The connecting band on these wireless phones is short and relatively stiff – with the kind of hard plastic coating I can easily wipe-down after a workout and clean with paper towel and a small dab of detergent.<br /><br />The Bluetooth pairing and functioning is fine with my Samsung Android phone. The sound quality is not as good as phones I use for ‘serious listening’ but it’s more than adequate for exercising where there’s a lot of background noise from my treadmill - and I’ll take durability over less than top-shelf sound for this purpose.<br /><br />There’s a simple, easy to grab volume adjustment along the outside of one phone rim – that’s all I need.  Forget about phone calls – the world can wait for the hour I’m exercising."
"Since the screen on the Note 5 comes clear to the edges of the phone, it's hard to hold the phone without touching the edges of the screen and interfering with what you're doing. This case is nice and sturdy and helps you keep a grip on your phone and fingers off the edge of the screen. It isn't bulky and is just right.<br /><br />Pros: good looking, helps keep grip, fits nicely to the phone, not loose feeling like some soft cases.<br /><br />Con's: because of it's slim design, probably won't offer much protection against drops or other possible damage.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend, especially since the stores aren't offering anything for the new phones yet"
first one broke after 2 days and the other quit after 1
Works very well for a quick and easy sound system. Can worknfor any application. Have had it almost 2 months and works excellent. Several friends are buying one for there utv's & atv's.
windows phones are horrible
"So far its been excellent! It came on time, the specs on the phone Internal storage 4.75GB, Built in storage 9.79GB and the 16GB SD card mounted. It responds to the touch. I love this phone so far!"
Love this case!  It fits my Samsung S6 great.
Worked perfectly for our Kindle as well as our Verizon ellipsis tablets. Best price I could find.
"This is a hard plastic screen protector from arcadia, and bought it fora replacement for the one my wife had on her phone. it comes with 3 sheets in case the first doesn't go well. my advise in installing it is to have the screen free of lint or dust, i took time to clean it very well so i didn't have to repeat the process. happy with my choice"
Makes a buzzing noise on a call.
doesn't support iPhone or iPad
Great armband carrier for my Note 4. Great 1 year guarantee too! After 9 months of normal wear and tear stitching started to come apart on armband. Contacted Avantree support very quickly received reply. No hassle replacement for new armband just had to pay $6 for shipping of new one!
screen had damage
Works great
it works fine and was a great price
"Great fit, love the feel of it."
stays on window very good. has stayed in place for several months now without having to restick
i love it
"From the past reviews, I thought this was a score at the price.  But I am not getting the same quality that I read about.  I have had numerous complaints about the sound quality from my customers on the other end.  From sounding like a bumblebee to on a very distant speaker phone.  My business relies on my cell phone, and I can't seem to find the right headset that works flawlessly.  Any suggestions...."
I bought this to use with my paddle board on the lakes and rivers.  It works great. Works perfectly with my iPhone 6. I use to take pictures which come out awesome and can still listen to my music.  (No headphones). Has a little leash which is nice so I don't drop my phone in the water.
"Spent hours and hours researching slim wallet cases for my new Iphone 6 and decided on this one.  Was particularly excited because it had a gold color option.  Alas, many of the reviews were true about the sliding door being difficult to open.  I had to push on the door so hard to open it, I thought I was going to break my phone.  I even gave it a try for a 2-3 days hoping it would loosen up and it didn't.  Returned it and now I'm back to trying out a few other case options."
excellent - a little pricey but looks and works great
One works the other doesn't
This product is FAKE! Do not purchase!
I like my product
Not what I expected
Great lenses 10/10
does this phone have a place for a sd card
Cons: heavy and takes forever to charge (understandably so)<br /><br />Pros: it's a pretty dang solid charger. I bought it for a vacation to Italy. It was awesome for charging in the airport and while abroad since we didn't have as many plug converters as needed. The LCD screen is probably my favorite part about it. I highly suggest this product.
Great case!  A bit of challenge getting the screen cover on without any specs of dust being trapped on it.
Haven't used yet. Looks like good quality.
Magnets are the same quality as the original ones that came with my imagnet phone cradle. Great deal for such a cheap price!
Extremely cute
They work great and price was great . Bought 2
Works until the accessory is not accepted on the iphone. I got maybe a months worth of use out of these before the iphone started rejecting the plug.
Was very nice for the price.  Fast delivery.
"It came with the cover snapped off, but after I put it back together and plugged it in I loved it. It seemed to charge my phone quicker then my old one, and I love that I can charge my phone in one and my daughter's phone in the other. The red light lets you know without wondering that your phone or device is charging. I have charged not only my phone but my laptop as well as my tablet. It seems substantial and strong enough to stand up to my teenagers and all the electronics that &#34;must&#34; be charged while driving. I am glad I was able to have the chance to purchase this through the VIP review club, and would definitely buy again."
I order this for my boss to find different jobs. He liked it so much I oder anther one for his other truck.
excellent product!
Very high quality product.  Recommended.
Thanks...
really works
"fall off everytime ,not a good product"
This case is amazing and worth every penny! It arrived earlier than the expected date. It does has port covers on the bottom which surprised me but other than that great case!
"love this case! I'm usually all about Otterbox but they seem to have cut a few corners with the new ones. The Otterbox case for my iPhone 5s stretched and didn't work after less than a month. I bought two of these (one for my husband) and I love it. It's slim so it fits in my pocket better. I also love the water resistant feature as we both work jobs where we end up soaked with sweat. Now I can keep my phone on me in case of emergencies and not worry about it being wet with bodily grossness. Lol! My one year old threw my phone across a room with hardwood floors where my dog, thinking it was a game of fetch, promptly ran over and snapped it up. The case had a couple of tiny knicks taken out of it but everything else was fine! The only thing I would change would be to make the backing a bit more like rubber so it catches on slick surfaces. I've also got an a**hole for a cat so even if my phone is out of reach of the kiddo, she'll knock it down for her own amusement. I'd say it's hit the floor pretty hard more than a dozen times because of the cat and my phone has suffered NO damage."
Love it
Great product!
Husband loves it
Touch screen is very poor. It respond too late and need to press hard. Not a good phone to have.
"For those of you who are into coloring pages, this looks like a coloring page for the back of your phone."
"This case has a very cute design and it fits an iPhone 6 perfectly. The case is soft and flexible, so in my opinion, its good for the looks, but I'd like a more rigid case for peace of mind when it comes to safety. The case doesn't cover up any important ports or the camera, but does cover every side and the corners well. The case is easy to put on and take off.  This product was purchased at a discount in exchange for a review."
I got defective item returned.
I bought this hub because we were going on a trip to Italy and I didn't want to carry a charger for everything we needed to charge. It worked out perfectly. Once we met up with friends there I left it in the living room and everyone was charging their phones on it.
Came on time and was more than expected.
Terrific!
"bad the pouch were you put cards has a pictire window which leaves mark on phone, plastic were you insert phone cracked after a week don't waste your money"
Beautiful little case. My wife loves it.
"Fantastic signal, worked great on a four hour drive across Colorado."
It does what it's advertised to do. Charges phone quickly and effectively with no issues. A great buy at a great price.
Just like OEM. Worked great and small screwdriver is a must.
It is perfect for my phone! Love the color!!
This is so cute and adorable case:)I got the Cat design and i just absolutely loved it.<br />The case is strong enough to protect phone.Easy to access the buttons and port.<br />Easy to put phone and remove.If you are an animal lovers this case is just really amazing and you will definely love it.<br />Recommended.<br />Im so happy to test this product in exchanged of my honest feedback.
Just as pictured! So cute!
Case was just as pictured. Came very quickly even delivered on a Sunday!
"This product works amazingly. I didn't want to spend they money to get the stereo replaced on my older model car, I take a lot of road trips, and i'm cheap, so this product is a dream. The sound was awesome, and it was super simple to use. Would highly recommend."
Great product
"Easy to use. Charges multiple devices multiple times for several days before this battery needs to be recharged. I have charged iPhones, iPad, Apple Watch, and a Windows tablet PC using this device without difficulty."
My case won't even snap on to my phone...
This thing is hard to use (when compared to Google Maps). And it has routed me to a low bridge.
easy to apply. great product
"I have had very good experience with this product, great performance, easy handling, ideal for me. high quality design!"
Solid very nice. Negative is it still doesn't make me feel safe about dropping the fun
This case is amazing. Saves my phone with every drop haha! Lasts for a long time.
Excellent
excelente
Sound quality is terrible and evidently the mic is too. People can't understand what I'm saying. Wish I could say it was worth the low price but it isn't. I give it two stars because technically it does do what is supposed to and pairs easily enough.
This is a great product!  I love being able to solar charge the battery and use that power to charge my phone. The lights are great to understand the charging/charging function. It is a great compact size and feels extremely dourable. The two USB ports are great options and it charges my phone quickly. Wonderful way to being power with you on be go.
Rather loose fitting
"This case is really nice. It has a smooth edges around the case to give it a sleek style. The case is a made of a an impact-resistant, transparent outer hardshell and co-molded, shock-absorbing inner Diagrid, or diagonal grid core to keep your phone stay safe from dropping and safe from being scratched. This case is easy to put on and feels good in my hands. I would recommend this case. Great price for a great case. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review."
This did not work with my iCarez privacy screen protector. This works on my iphone but I would not recommend. Spend an extra few bucks on an adonit brand stylus. I borrowed a friends that works great.
"On time, no problems."
solid case to protect my phone.  home button requires a very strong push to operate.
"I use this most everyday on my bicycle.  I get to rock to my iTunes, check weather, or use it for turn-by-turn navigation through the streets of downtown Portland Oregon."
After the wite area of the case get dirty and kind change the color.  Mmmm. I try to clean it but the dirty doesn't come off.
"This is the third Moto e 2nd generation I buy. First I got 2 two for my parents and now one for my sister in law, and it is amazing. For the price you get way more than what you expect. Even when it is a budget phone it has features that easily knock the competition, specially on performance."
Satisfied
"This Tracfme is evetything advertised and ecverything I wanted. I have no use for a smartphone. Activatiion was no problem and adding minutes was quick and easy. My wife saw it and played around with it a bit, thin asked mi to order one exactly the same to replace her contract phone. Very intuitive."
Only works for one charge and only charges for about 30 minutes before it gets hot to the touch and shuts itself off.. Invest some money into a name brand one. This is what I get for being cheap. -_-
Very good devices got the green and black ones and both work with my iPhone6+ and Nexus6 tested with camera for pics will keep you updated with video.
Flimsy and gets dirty really quick. Like discolored
"Amazing product, will buy this over any other glass protector"
Good
Great for size and power!
"This is a truly great GREEN product!  Unlike plastic phone covers, the eCo-cover doesn't slip out of hands or pockets per its &#34;rubbery&#34; feel, but made from CORN!  Baby safe BPA free makes it ok for our grand-babies to chew on and handle.  So we protect our phones, grandkids, and the environment all at once.  So cool."
I love this overall but am unable to get the macro lens to attach  Can anyone help me
Good item
excellent
"Excellent small unit that pretty much works as described.  I say &#34;pretty much&#34; only because I had read some reviews that indicated some issues with continuous charging.  I did experience this once, but am not sure that the unit was to blame.  I was charging a cell phone and a smart watch (with wireless charging) over night while on vacation and, one morning, woke up to find neither the watch or the phone charged, and the unit was not working.  I unplugged it and then plugged it right back in the same outlet, and it proceeded to charge fine that morning and then the remaining times I used it.  So, since house I was in was brand new, and since there were no clocks in the room that would be blinking in the event of an electrical outage, I really cannot be sure it was the iClever device.  As a result, I am giving iClever the benefit of the doubt, but giving it 4 stars and not 5.  If I determine that there are any issues, I will update my review."
Arrived on time and as described.
Good product. Good for the price and for its purpose
"Can't live without my Mophie as I'm in her phone so much on calls and texting, my phone without round die around Noon. Not cool when you got an afternoon of conference calls. Now I never have my phone die, got lots if power snd only charge at night. Worth every penny."
I brought this for my big brother for work he loves it and it's really easy to use.
"Love this case, super girly just like me!!  Great customer service from KoKo cases with amazing shipping time. Great company, will definitely purchase from KoKo again!  Thanks!!"
This Glass protector is everything I wanted. Easy to install. Just follow the directions. I think they have a Youtube video on how to apply​ the Glass.
nice product.
"Very protective, I've dropped my phone countless time and not even a scratch yet! These cases work great for my family and you can't beat the price!"
"Great, just what I needed and worked without any issues.  This item is exactly what you need if you have an Otterbox type case on your iPhone and need an extension to into the phone for charging, especially for those chargers that have the big square ends on them."
"convenient for when phone is low, sleek and small"
The case is good but the outer plastic layer sucks after on drop the plastic broke from where the volume buttons are. Otherwise it's ok.
Never had a waterproof case.  Taking a little bit to get used to.  Great coverage for the phone.  My only complaint is I thought there would be more grip on the sides.
works exactly as advertised.
Looks great and works perfectly
Fits great! feels nice and looks good! great buy for the price! Highly recommended!
"Easy to install, no issues at all."
Works with nook color but an expensive cord without the plug adaptor
great
Snelle levering klasse
The case cracked easily whenever I would take it off. Its hard to access few letters when I was texting or trying to close out certain ads. The picture I would take was rather blurry
"I've had this case for more than 6 months, no scratches so far even after multiple drops."
for a penny i love this case
"So far so good, it seems to be working for my daughter and she has nothing negative to say, actually compaired to the unit she had before it charges her kindle much faster."
Great GPS do what it is meant to do.
"Pretty cheap, phone clamp loosens up and turns easy."
no instruction manual-radio ok
"Super poorly made, took FOREVER to get. Not worth it. 2 days after I received it, the cheap plastic literally broke in half as I was trying to get it off to get to my battery to change."
"Thick, but EXTREMELY flexible wire.  Has good quality feel.  Superior redesign from their original models.  Also own sevrral Kopi high-current cables (which are also highly recommended), but these are better for the money!"
"Case is nice, but the button covers are difficult to press especially the. Also the outside black bumper makes a white iPhone look cheap. I will probably buy a different case soon because I am not happy with this one. Only thing that was nice was the picture."
"Very difficult to program, manual was very hard to understand. I have had several Analog scanners but now most police are Digital. The Terminology in the manual is all new that is unfamiliar to me. After many hours of trying to figure it out I became frustrated and sent it back for refund."
I got my case today ..I love the color and the fit.
Worked nicely!!! Easy to use and well made. Just what I needed to install and after market radio.
I accidentally dropped my ipod touch and now it is shattered not to mention my ipod slips ou of the pocket that is supposed to hold it tight. It is also extremely bulky and should not even be called a case. This leather pouch is terribly fit and was an extreme let down DO NOT get it.
"Have bought several of these now, they're awesome. I travel with one, use another in the car when several of us are traveling (car has a AC plugin), have one at my desk, nightstand, and now in my living room."
beautiful;
Piece of junk do not buy this radio....ive had it in my car for a month and a half and the screen stopped working i want my money back
"Advertised to fit wrists 135-195 mm.  My wrist is 153 mm, and this band was still way too big, even with all four links removed.  Returning the band was trouble free, after I called Amazon and complained about me having to pay the return postage (Amazon credited my account with the return postage).  The band, itself, was very attractive with the Space Gray Sport Watch.  I would have kept it had it fit."
"Pretty case, looks just like the picture"
"Very nice product, especially for the price.  The build quality is good, and the included resizing tool works well."
I loveee my new phone case ! It came right on time
"Outstanding Cable! It is absolutely worth spending the extra money to get a genuine FTDI Cable, Works flawlessly !!!"
"At first I loved this case, it was exactly what I was looking for.  It had a good fit and the kickstand worked perfectly.  After the first couple months, the thin plastic broke off above the volume buttons, no biggie.  6 months later, this case is like a 20 year old car in Arizona, the plastic is extremely brittle and new pieces seem to break off every time I use it.  No longer happy with my purchase."
Excellent and durable case
Very sturdy and looks great. I love how it feels.
hold phone nice and tight the rubber band stop phone from moving easy to attach to bike daughter love it
I am unable to rate this product as I have not used it since purchased.  The battery was ordered in the event the charger purchased for phone did not resolve the issue.
went on good and can't hardly tell you put it on
Item as described.
"One of the best Alpine I have ever owned.  My only concern is the sound adjustment needs a little more tweeking.  On my old Alpine, I could pick the frequency, and the MX was easier to turn on and off.  Other than that, this stereo is great.  It went in easy, and with all the necessary hardware. I love the Blu tooth capability, and especially the ability to play music without having a jack to connect to, even though it comes with both a jack and a USB port.  I would buy this all over again if I had to..."
You get what you pay for... it broke the 2nd day I had it
Tried my first Android :)
Excellent quality. Classy look. I received compliments non-stop.
Case fits phone well and belt is secure.
It is protective and unobtrusive. The buttons on the phone all work well. I like the material and translucent look.
Nice Fit.
it broken when installing the cell phone. I need that I send a new one!!
Very thin case. The decals on the inside of the case were pealing when I received it. Pictures come out blurry! Did not like it all!
Broke in 4 hours
DISAPPOINTED!!<br /><br />Was glad to receive it the day before my trip. Very disappointed because it didn't charge my phone at all though it was plug in the whole day 😕. Tried to switch from both output but still not working. Going to return it!
Absolutely love the quick charge of this charger. Charges my moto x in about 40 minutes. I couldn't live without it now.
This charges my Galaxy S5 but at a MUCH slower pace than the one that came with my phone. It takes hours while the original charges my phone fully in 30 minutes.
Excellent product ..4 weeks later still no issue thanks for your service
Easy
Charging is good but durability is not there they only lasted about two weeks each
Case did not work for my phone.
"Very Good Quality, nice feel connectors.  Impressive cable!"
"This has been fantanstic.  It quick charges my phone (an i6) which has been REALLY useful when out for a long day.<br /><br />Down sides:  Takes a long time to charge, and is a little heavy to carry around -- but I usually leave one in the car.<br /><br />For the great price, I bought 2, so the long charge time doesn't cause a problem.  When one is charged, I put it in my car and plug in the second."
"Perfect delivery time, excellent product"
"An excellent case at a very reasonable price.  My daughter opted for the light pink and really likes it.  It seems sturdy yet lightweight and the edge comes over the screen enough that I'm hopeful it will protect the glass if the phone is dropped.  So far, so good. Highly recommended!"
[[ASIN:B00DZSGS8W BLU Q170T Samba TV Unlocked Dual SIM Quad-Band GSM Phone (White/blue)]] this gatge this device vin with deserts programming details which do not allow me to save messages or contacts or because at times restarts alone and makes me lose the information stored with the understanding that they sent a malfunctioning phone.
To Thick
"Awful, awful, awful! I used twice! I went on a jet ski tour and it kept my phone safe and secure for my trip BUT when i opened it after the trip, I couldn't reseal it to use it again....What a tremendous disappointment! This happened conveniently after the 30 day return policy had just ended! What a waste!"
Great case
For the price it is perfect
Thank you
"I've wanted one of these for years.<br /><br />I bought one as a Christmas present for myself since I didn't really get anything.<br />When my family saw it, they laughed, but then they started using it and really liked it as well.<br /><br />This is especially useful for me since there are cracks on my phone near the speakers and it cuts into my ear when I talk on the phone. The handset is much easier to hold and more comfortable as well. It's also more clear since I can't hear as much outside noises on my end."
Love this armband!!
Great value.  Case is completely waterproof and the profile is very slim considering it is a waterproof case.
"Works as expected. Good product, great price."
"Easy to use, great for the gym and work. I received this product for an honest review. Charges easily and ready to go."
Handy to hold phone in vents so I don't have to look down just takes a little time to create a special bend that works
Good product
Do NOT purchase!!!  The pen doesn't work and the stylus doesn't work.  The stylus was like trying to use a pencil eraser!  It was sent from China.  It was a package of two and neither one worked at all.  My money was refunded but it was inexpensive so I'm sure some people just throw them away.
"A great portable charger. Small powerful, charges apple and android."
"I bought this for my son about 4 months ago. Verus reached out today, making sure that we liked the product and asking us to write a review. Although we haven't needed customer service, it appears they genuinely want to supply a great product. My son loves the case. He has used it every day for the past 4 months. It shows minimal wear. His only concern is that if he every lost the compartment cover, his case would look awful. Of course this has not happened. In fact, he says that the cover has not come off by accident a single time over the past 4 months. It look very nice and doesn't add much bulk to the phone, even with the secret compartment. I do not hesitate to recommend this case to anyone with an S6."
"This headset are great! I have been using them for a few days now and I am really liking it. The build quality is good, with the rubber being very durable which is hard to find these days. The sound isolation is great whether you're listening to music, or watching a movie on the plane. The microphone is not really up to par, as it doesnt sound the best, but I wouldn't hold it against this. With that being said, these aren't too expensive, so I would totaly recommend these to friends."
It's thing barely works I wouldn't recommend this to product. I gave this product a 2 because the light came on when I plugged it in.
"Okey, thumps up!"
"Exactly the product I wanted, very good price, received in no time. In fact, I ordered two more."
strange looking shell for an external drive; I wonder where the usb cable is located at; maybe under the cap.  I did not know that pvc welding adhesive was conductive for electronic use.  :-)
good for price
looks great.
Very neat ~ I love it and get compliments on it frequently.
"Works exactly as it should.  indicator light let's you know when it's done charging,  and charging a dead battery only takes about 5-6 hours. I haven't had a problem yet,  after 3 weeks of everyday use"
"Works fine, good price, very happy."
Cheap both in price and in quality
Cable works fine by using a Live CD (Linux) of the CHIRP software. I did not even try to use the included driver CD. The cable was used to program 10 Retevis H777 radios and a Baofeng UV-5R radio with no problems.
Good
This is great when im working out. Finally found one for the 6 plus!!!

"Love itt. It keeps my phone nice and dry, can't wait to use it on my vacation"
Works wonderfully and keeps my phone charged.
fit my phone perfectly.  fast shipping and great price
Product arrived on time and has surpassed expectations<br />I work outside and in the weather and it has been flawless
"This is a GREAT CASE! Yes, it looks as good in real life, as it does in the picture. It functions great too! Seriously, i couldn't be happier. I got it in two days, too."
"It came earlier than I thought, which is good. It's a very cheap price but the quality is actually really good. It came as it said it would, it's nice and soft and well, clear 😂 I recommend to buy this case if you'd like."
Good buy!
"This is fantastic! I have been looking for something that is large enough to fit my iPhone 6 plus while I run. I cannot tell you how amazing this arm band works. I definitely suggest getting one. It had made SUCH a difference in my running. I run anywhere from 3-10 miles every time I run. And will be ramping up my running soon. It was such a hassle not having something to fit my phone, I have the water bottles and energy / gu packets all perfectly placed in my waist belt. All I was missing was my phone holder! THANK YOUU!"
"Absolutely great case! Durable material, easy to put on and take off and the side buttons on the phone are just as responsive with the case on as they are with it off. Great purchase!"
It is just what I wanted.
It's great
"Bad, quality"
"Awesome,love it, delivery at my apartment do so fast. Didn't had to pay all that money at Verizon store.  Thank you so much ;)"
Best ever.
It cracked in the corner with the slightest pressure I dropped it and it shattered my phone and the adhesive in the corners do not stick
Great product!
My favorite
I like it
Was disappointed with the case and even more when I realized the back cover was coming off straight out the box but the customer service was great despite that.
Since I had to return the phone it didn't work now I have a screen protector that I can't use.. I have to pay the postage to get all my money back..hassle..
terrible fit and sound
Excellent!!  Charges super fast!
came in handy
very good. blue tooth setup easy. sound quality very good. fits and stays snug in ears. best blue tooth headphones I've had!
"Slim but very protective, great for a large phone that you don't want to be GIGANTIC with a protective case"
"I just purchased my apple watch with a simple black band and thought about buying more band colors but did not want to spend $40 per band from apple. I thought I might find a similar band on Amazon for less money and I was right. This color of the band is great and i have received a lot of compliments already. I have worn it running, paddle boarding (I know the apple watch is not rated for water), and in the gym. It is secure and very, ver  comfortable. The band was very easy to put on and take off, it adjusts just like an apple band and the color is true to the apple green. I just ordered 2 more colors."
when i first received the case i thought it was cute but i have not even had this case for a week and the black on it is already fading. its a piece of junk.
so far the product has been great with zero problems. so nice having so many ports! another great product from Noot!
My daughter loves it good product.
Great
Great bargain - works great!
it did not work after only two weeks of using it . very dissapointed
Wonderful pens. They have fiber tips and the price was excellent.  I would highly recommend this product.
The stylus is great.  My only problem was I didn't get a pink one I ordered.
"I have had these headphones for over a week now and I can say that I like them.  This is my first pair of bluetooth earphones so I was very excited when I received my item.  The packaging is AMAZING.  Honestly, this is one of the best shipments I have ever received as far as packaging.Upon opening the box, I immediately tested the product out.  It is very simple to sync to my iphone, and fits well in my ears.  Turning on and off is simple too with its audio commands.  I have since used them while at work, as well while I cut my grass.  They stay in place, there is not a long cord connecting me to a phone, and the charge life on mine is sufficient for my need.<br /><br />I received this item at a discount for an unbiased review."
"Awesome product! I was looking for a way to keep all our tech stuff off my kitchen counter, this was it! It has been a lifesaver- keeps our items charged and in one spot!"
"Good idea but with an Otterbox case on the iPhone, I find it spend way too much time lining up the connector. Wanted a dock I could quickly drop the phone into but this is more work than simply using a regular lightning cable. Would not recommend."
"My 10 year old daughter just loves this watch.  Th only thing that was a little surprising was the size.  For being a youth watch, it's large."
Great product great costumer service great prices
goid
Works for a couple hours and dies.
Works exactly as I expected it to.
Looks exactly as pictured and arrived on schedule
"Fast shipping, great product."
"Very quick shipping and works great. Has a few different options like a radio and bluetooth. It does have an option to charge as you ride if you have a cigarette lighter port. The batteries do last a good while on a charge though. I have a windshield on my bike, and you can't really hear it going down the interstate, but riding through town it does well. As long as I am under 50 MPH I can hear it. I bought it mainly because it required no wiring, so I figured it would not be too loud. It did sit out through a heavy rainstorm, and still plays just fine. It came with two ways to quickly attach it."
"Fits great, looks nice good price"
One of them was bent upon arrival.  Will u replace.
For the price the armband is a great buy. I find it annoying with the headphone cord but that is to be expected. I leave my phone case on and it fits but it's hard to change songs.
"Very sturdy case, easy to grip. I recommend this for any LG phone owner."
"Quick delivery, stays on the phone great."
"Tested it in my sink first with paper inside, and it was completely dry. It can be hard to open, but hey, it is waterproof! I can fit my Samsung Galaxy S6 with the Otter Box case inside. It is a tight fit, so I am careful when putting it in and taking it out so I don't rip the plastic."
Charges fast!  I can stream music and use a map program and still get my phone charged.
This phone wasn't Android 5 and is NOT 4glte on At&t networks .. other than that is a great phone for the money
Phone was in great condition. have not found any marks on it. Great purchase. I would purchase again.
DO NOT BUY. WISH THERE WERE A NO STAR RATING BECAUSE THATS WHAT THIS CASE DESERVES. my phone fell out of my hand. on to its back didn't bounce just flat on its back. considering this case is only on the back I would think it would protect it. well I look down and my phone is shattered glass all over the floor. I can nearly see what I'm type on its so badly cracked. air under the screen glass missing and a bad case on my phone.  couldn't get worse.
awful case. the screen protector got dust between it and the adhesive on the protector came loose within 3 weeks. the plastic inner part of the case started cracking and I didn't even drop it yet! I can't return it now that it is broken but i wish i could. Im just going to get an otter box commuter for better quality.
Range is low. We went to a park with a lot of shrubs and trees on 3 bikes and I completely lost the other riders on the trail in less than a mile.
"Awesome!!! This product is exactly what I needed. It's easy to apply, and inexpensive to buy. Love it!!!"
works great!
Everything went well and product arrived in a timely manner.
Great product!!!
"loved it, but didn't fit"
Perfect case for the ultra. Can't beat it. Super thin and great price
Great product for the price!
Good quality screen film! The glitters are really pretty.
Exactly as described and depicted in the photo
"Fits my go pro good, but the nut stripped first time i tried screwing it on, luckily i have a giant surplus of gopro supply's so i stole a nut off one of the other mounts which didn't fit snugly in so i glued it, the material looks sturdy enough, looks and feels just like my gopro brand hat mount."
Lightning cable only works in one direction and the lightning tip broke off after 1 week of use. The retractable portion is also much larger than others I have. Would not recommend.
Fits the phone perfectly snug and looks slick.  Has a good grip as well to avoid having the phone slip out of my hands.
A+
JUNK!A WASTE OF MONEY!FLIMSY NO GRIP!WORTH ABOUT $1
Light weight case perfect for adult use but not recommended for a child's tablet.
I received this product free in exchange for a honest review. The case comes in a little plastic baggy. The case doesn't make your phone that much thicker or heavier at all! This case is definitely going to protect your phone. Everything fits perfect and snug. The buttons function properly and this plastic case is not made cheaply it really is durable! Fits my Galaxy s5 spot on! Would definitely recommend!
This item is a battery saver if I'm in the car. For my apartment I have a 12v DC power supply with a cigarette lighter plug so I can continue to use the radio without worrying about running low on battery power. I have purchased  3 UV-82 radios and so I'll be buying a few more of these Eliminators. I recommend this product to everyone with a car and a UV-82.
you have to turn power off to this unit once or twice a day to keep it working
Best case for anyone that might be prone to dropping there phone. (my 14 daughter)
Love this case
Fast shipping and quality product
"Did not work, please refund my purchase."
"I had no problem pairing with my cell phone. Sound is very clear on both ends. I haven't listened to music yet.,want to save battery. I found out too late that the battery can only be charged approx. 300 times then , garbage. I bought them to listen to TV at night. When I get the transmitter put on my TV , I will update with the results. Maybe 5 stars, we'll see ! The fit is good . I have a larger than average head and I did not need to adjust the headband . I remembered that someone said that the band would break in the middle , so I slid them on at the temple and then pushed them  down over my ears , avoiding stretching them."
didn't last very long
"Best product, no worries where to connect your device."
really good
"I bought thewse a while ago so they've stood the test of time. Today, I needed to replace the tip but decided use a different color for a while. It struck me that the one I'd used for 6+ months looked as good as the new one. Always spot one one the touch screen and handy with the attachable cord....these stylus are the perfect blend of form anf function."
"Pros:<br />Huge right out the box, did not know it would be as big as it was.Great for streaming shows and movies.<br />Cons:<br /> The front camera is horrible, even in good lighting.<br />The rear camera is very exposed which allows it to be easily scratched on surfaces, I cant even see out of mine anymore and i have never dropped my phone.<br />The screen is cheap. 7 inch screen should have Gorilla glass or something to protect it. The entire middle of my phone is unusable because the screen has caved in, which now makes it a 6 inch screen.<br /><br />I had hoped that when they made the Studio 7 II that they would improve on the camera and screen but unfortuantly they didnt, its basically the same exact phone. Save your money. I prefer the Life Pro ot Vivo Selfie if you want to stick with BLU and stay in budget, both have better cameras and designed better in quality."
Fits my Droid Turbo perfectly.  I don't need an outer cover.
Great buy. Works as described.
I ordered 4 cases for our summer family vacation. Each case worked GREAT!
It broke easily
Fit and works great !
Got this at a discounted price for an honest review. This glass really helps I've ordered it 2 times if it wouldn't have been bc of this glass I would've had a cracked phone. Amazing!
Great
"The edges don't seem to seal on the Note 5, other than that it was very easy to install and I'm very happy with it so far."
"This is by far the single best protector on the market. Functions perfectly , enhances the device, and really really works!"
I like the slim look and feel. Feels durable and fits the phone perfectly. I would order from them again.
"Not bad. I LOVE these style of Bluetooth headsets. This one is slightly different from my very first pair I got over a year ago. They are the same shape but this one is not as finished as my current set.  The sound quality is not as clear as my QCY set but is pretty good. It has a nice balance of sound and the bass is sufficient. The sound quality is not like those expensive Beats or bose headphones, but it’s good enough for the price point. These go in the ear so it does block sound out. It blocks noise out so well that when I’m using these in the office, I can get more work done because I don’t hear the chatter of people around me.<br /><br />These use your standard micro usb cables so there’s no fear if you lose the cable that this set comes with. It charges up full in about an hour from dead and right out of the box it charged up in about 30 minutes. The battery life lasts me about 3 work days before needing to be recharged and that includes using it while on the way home from work which is a one hour minimum drive to and from the office.<br /><br />When using this for phone calls, you must leave the left ear piece hanging down around your neck. The microphone is on that earpiece. If you leave it in your ear, the person on the other end will not hear you clearly because the mic will be by your ear. The one thing this set is missing is a clip so you can clip that ear piece onto your collar for phone calls. If you’re like me and always moving around, if the earpieces shuffles around, the person on the phone can hear all the movement.<br /><br />Also, the volume button. It is very temperamental. When I try to hit volume up, I barely touch it and it adjusts volume. When I press down on it adjust volume it has a slow reaction. It’s almost like it works like a touch screen. Holding down the volume up and down buttons while listening to music will skip forward and back on your song list. With very minimal buttons, this is a very easy headset to use. It comes with an instructional booklet complete with photo to show you where the buttons and mic are.<br /><br />It comes with multiple ear pieces so you can change them out to the most comfortable size for you.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional sample for my honest review.s with an instructional booklet complete with photo to show you where the buttons and mic are.<br /><br />It comes with multiple ear pieces so you can change them out to the most comfortable size for you.<br /><br />I was provided a promotional sample for my honest review."
Thank you
"Fits quite well, and has stood up to a few &#34;gravitational incidents&#34;.  Controls are not affected, had no problem."
Great product
Great sound quality and noise cancellation in relation to the price. Fits great and has a decent microphone.
Stopped working 6 weeks after purchase - it just died.<br /><br />The music quality was OK - lost a lot of bass response vs the wired connection to my phone.
I just received this charger and it's great. It works very well. Happy with the service and product.
Cool l like it :)
Do great this product is great throughout.  The best thing  about them is you can't beat the cost!
It was ok
I love this Blue tooth It blocks out the majority of background noise It is very comfortable as I have littler ears than most & most other blue tooth's hurt my ear's & I love it that they added a volume up down feature as well! I recommend this dealer as it comes in a very nice box/case & other's in bulk packaging do not work as well as this one! It also holds a charge for a long time & it barely takes a little over 5 minutes to charge
Does exactly what it says on the Tin
I love it so much I bought another one just for the future if this one wears out holding up really well so far I get lots of compliments on it
Sounds great. Fit perfect in my 02 escape.
They are pretty legit. Charge just fine. I don't know why but i thought they were metal. heh.
Great Product.  It's always protected phone well.  Only complaint would be with belt clip - it breaks easily.
"This case is for people who want a regular case with a stand. Personally, I dislike wallet-style cases, but I need to be able to prop up my phone. This case solved my problems. A few considerations:<br /><br />1. The stand is easy to use, and seems quite sturdy. I don't expect it to fall off or break somehow.<br />2. The case itself is sturdy. It makes the phone feel bigger but that's to be expected.<br /><br />This is a great hybrid between a regular case and wallet case. I was given this case for my objective evaluation."
Not Apple headset. One was broken I just threw them away. I'm very glad I didn't spend a lot of money on them.
Products don't work. Spend a few more dollars and get a better product. Very disappointed and will NEVER order from these suppliers again.
The quality is solid. Comes with a micro usb cables. Great!
"This is a very nice charger for your phone and other tech toys. It isn't too large, and does a good job of recharging your phone. It can also be charged by using the port on your laptop. Extra security for traveling or at the university is always nice. These chargers are great!"
Protects phone well but makes it very hard to hear people when they call.  They sent a replacement without me even asking and it works much better.  Great seller
"What a great idea, the Pyle PLCM7200 Backup Camera & Rearview Monitor Parking Reverse System.<br />My truck has a built in reverse camera which is dead on for hooking up the trailer.<br />The trailer has a 350 gallon water tank and is wider than the truck so backing was a hit and miss gamble on narrow<br />mountain roads.<br />I bought and installed the Pyle 7200 on the back of the trailer and tested it out in the yard, it worked perfectly.<br />Not needing to make a water run, I left it parked for several weeks. During that time it rained several times.<br />When I needed water I hooked the trailer up and was off to get water. I couldn’t see a thing behind the trailer.<br />When I examined the Pyle 7200 I found it nearly filled with water from normal rain. I removed the camera, dried it out,<br />sealed it  with gasket goop and it worked again but only until it warmed up, creating a condensation over the lens.<br />It does that every time I want to use it now. I would like to replace it with another that has never been wet, or even another<br />12 volt camera that was made to be outdoors. You would think a backup camera would be weather proofed for outdoor use.<br />THL"
Feels cheaply made and its huge!!! I got this for running so that I wouldn't have to remove my case (Spigen Tough Armor).  It's a decent size case and this band is still too big. The phone bounces all around when moving.
"Didn't work for me , but the color is a perfect match."
I had a issue with my last order so they sent me new ones and they work perfect
It's rated at max power. It's only 1400 watts at 1 ohm. Grrr....
Works as described.
Was a gift.
Bought this months ago and it works better than when I bought my phone originally
Received these today and my 8 yr old autistic son loves them
They were worth it
Great deal
It was the wrong item. I thought i was ordering a phone case. I was disappointed.
"I received this product in exchange for a unbiased review,the shipping was fast and packaged securely the instructions were easy to follow and this screen protector fit my device perfectly. all ports and speakers work properly, fingerprints are easy to wipe off. i put on a case right afterwards and the screen protector didn't interfere made of durable materials and keeps my screen safe from damage. I have dropped my phone several times since and I also keep it in a large purse nice price for the durability and quantity"
Very inexpensive and works perfectly.
"Perfect for running, does not fall off your arm and both my iPhone 6 plus and Note 3 will fit in it."
Plastic piece holds phone on top and bottom. Cracked the first week.
just what I wanted. Nice fit.
Great product
Did not charge
Good quality for the price. This is for my work phone so it is carried around all day and stuffed in my pockets. I would reorder.
Worked so well I bought another.
It's nice looking and really fit my phone very well.
Great speaker so far. Have had it about a month. I primarily use in the shower but makes a great everyday speaker. Sound quality is decent for the size and the price. Would and have recommended to others.
Great for the price! Easy to install. I've used the regular screen protectors on every iPhone I've have but I like this one way better.
As good if not Better than the one that came in the box day one. How Anyone could rate this poorly is beyond me.
bought in purple and loved it so much bought another for mother in law
"Excelent budget bluetooth speaker with decent battery life.  It's not as rugged as other models but this will allow it to be even more portable.  The volume does not go up as loud as I would like it to.  Still, for $22, it's a great deal."
"I was at first sceptical about riding a Blu phone based on some review, but since we have never had a problem with an item I have bought directly from Amazon, I ordered it.  For the price it is a good reliable phone for every day smartphone uses.  It will not replace my Samsung S5, but it is a good secondary phone as I have one phone for each of the networks in Jamaica.  I would definitely recommend this phone."
Wish it was waterproof
no problem using this product. I triple my minutes
I love this case.
Got to me fast. It is an OK quality but serves its purpose.
Love this stuff.  Cant live without it.  Gives just the right touch of color and smells good too.
"Great product. Received it on time. Come with everything you would need to change out coverplate, plus spare parts."
Works well.
"Very poor quality.  No matter what I do, people can't hear me when I'm using it.  In some cases, it doesn't even speak correct English."
It's great! Better then what I thought it would be. Just wish it came with a screen protector.
Got these cables because they said they were guaranteed and had a lifetime warranty.  They work for about a week then break.  Have been sent replacement cables which work for about a week then break.  The company kept me on the hook long enough so I went past the 30 rerun date with Amazon.  They suck don't buy them
Poor quality. Discoloration and flutter. Spent the extra money and get a quality screen
I like it. not perfect but good!
Was not what I expected. Cheaply made.
"Worked great after I cracked the screen on my iPhone 4.  go to youtube for general instructions, proceed carefully and the rest was pretty easy."
"Nice case, fits well."
Terrific!
"DONT BUY THIS CASE ON AMAZON!!! Buy it from the Apple Store. I bought this case from the Apple Store and it was great, very protective. But when I bought this from Amazon it was a cheap flimsy Chinese knock off. It's not the real thing!!!!"
works perfectly.
My wife likes them
CUTE case and worked perfectly
Perfect for a p3 12
Great case! Has a good grip to the phone and looks super cute!
"Wonderful case. I broke my other one myself and made another order that evening, I love theses cases because they are not expensive and very tough. I would recommend this product to anyone , I love it"
"Great product, fits my cell in it's case, which will make it easier, and protect my phone better. Camp on time as promised."
"excellent cable, it even has a proper strain relief."
Great phone.
"Perfect. Fits perfectly on the top of the phone and works great with iPhone 6 Case, Spigen® [AIR CUSHION] Bumper [Ultra Hybrid Series] [Crystal Clear] Air Cushion Technology Bumper Case with Clear Back Panel for iPhone 6 (2014) - Crystal Clear (SGP10954)"
I love it can carry everything I need in it.
"Sound quality and fit is good for the price, but don't expect to be blown away."
Protects the phone good and realy nice case
That awkward moment when it's the wrong their 😂😂😂
It doesn't fit in the event
They look good. Expensive for being made entirely of plastic. Hope they don't break.
"It works fine..but it has a lanyard, and nowhere on the instructions does it tell you how to or where to hook it..."
This really holds my Garmin in place on my large van dashboard.  Great product!
Was a gift. Daughter loves it. Just what I expected.
my daughter had it 2 days and dropped her phone. the phone case broke. don't think it was worth the money
solid awesome product!
Wonderful product. Fits perfectly. Timely delivery
bad right out of the box.
JUST BEAUTIFUL
Just what I wanted. Works well. Great for my walks or when you need hands free.
Experience says this does a good job of protecting.
Very happy
"Although a high quality item, it did not stay connected properly to the iPhone with a proper fit on the charging cord, possibly an old design fit for an earlier iPhone than the 6."
"Claimed all in one Gps For running, cycling, swimming and golf. Great when it actually works but frustrated by its lack of reliability. Difficulty syncing device. Frequently resets itself during the day on its own. Vibration feature stopped working, rendering the alarm feature useless."
nicely made -
"Minimal useful features - half of the apps on the watch are non functional, the radio feature doesn't work without the cheap and ill fitting earbuds, the touchscreen is either overly fiddly or unresponsive when using the on screen keyboard, etc. Surprisingly, I did put a sim card in it from our spare line, and that seems to work, but god help you trying to dial a number on the screen  keypad.<br /><br />The only thing that worked reliably was the notifications from my phone to the watch, but since it'll basically replicate EVERY notification of EVERY type by default, you then have to go into the poorly constructed host app on your phone and disable 99% of them. Oh, did I mention that you have to run a garbage coded scammy looking app and service in the background of the host phone, above and beyond the bluetooth connection, for any of this to &#34;work&#34;?<br /><br />Camera quality is poor. The remote shutter control thing is kinda neat (when it works), allowing you to use the watch to trigger the camera on your phone remotely.<br /><br />Almost no customization of the watch face, fonts, backgrounds, etc. The only saving grace is that it's as cheap as a lot of non smart watches, and it does seem to keep time."
This does not fit the screen on my iPhone 6. It is too small. Cell 4 Tech did not offer any solution.
"Awesome screen protector. :)  incredibly easy to apply,  and that's coming from someone who has no hand-eye coordination."
waterproof
great
Exactly what was needed at a great price.
Love this!
"Awesome phone. Touch works fine even with the hard glass protectant, fits perfectly, it's smaller than the otter box (more like a life proof) but heavier and much sturdier. The small piece that clips in to protect the charger port and headphone plug in may pop out a bit but it's because it's a tight fit and needs to be worked in a bit. All the buttons and controls work flawlessly, but the power button does require more pressure to depress, probably to make sure it's not accidentally turned off in your pocket since all others are effortless. I have had otter box, lifeproof, and a million others with my iPhone's and this is the sturdiest by far."
"I love this product! It's very lightweight and durable. It also has two pockets for mostly used cards or an ID pocket. What surprised me is the small mirror it came with, great idea..not too bulky! It arrived in a very sturdy package to protect it. I would buy another, to gift for a friend."
Great product!
Best for the price! I love Anker products
perfect fit
love how loud it is even with out amp... hooked to cb and scared the hell out of everyone i yelled at .... small so its easy to put anywhere on truck..... id buy more if needed
Increased the signal on my cellular game camera by 2 bars!<br /><br />I'm using it on a SpyPoint 4g game camera. Increased the signal by 2 bars and works great.
Got it for my daughter and she loves it!
"This portable battery pack is perfect for traveling. I use it to charge my galaxy note phone and galaxy tablet, and I have found that I could get 5-6 full charges on my phone.The 2.1A charging port allows for a very quick charge, and the extra 1.5A USB port is a huge plus. The only downside to this device is that I have found that it takes 8-12 hours to fully charge. This is not really a problem though as I just charge it the night before its intended use. I purchased this product a little over 6 months ago and it still functions just as well as the day I bought it. I would absolutely purchase this product again in the future."
"perfect fit for my android phone,great price.Fits security of my belt .Easy to get out of case and snap back in,like it a lot.I have seen people bend over and their smart phones fall from their shirt pocket,hit the floor ,not a good thing.With this case you will not have that problem.Also does not scratch screen."
Happy with my purchase. I recomended.
wish i hadnt bought it.
Worked great for me.  Used the suggested library and displayed bmp files from the sd card.  Have not yet tried displaying text.
Worked as described at the waterpark.  We used them just yesterday and all phones were completely safe and the camera worked great too.
Fast shipping. Product great
thank you so much
To big
Easy to apply. Stays put
All that it is advertised to be.  Plan to order more in a variety of colors.
My three year old loves these! I tried them on myself. They are comfortable and work well.
This phone was a disaster.  It would not go into 4G mode when 4G was available.  After searching the web I learned that there was an un-fixable bug with the RAZRs and 4G.  I lived with it for two weeks and then the speaker stopped working on the phone.  At that point I returned it.
Really good case. I like it.
it worked
Battery life was okay ... but the build quality was horrendous!... on both batteries the flat cover for the bottom of the batteries came off the first time I put them on the included battery charger!. Needless to say I sent them back and got me a refund.
"The microphone port doesn't work, no one can hear me talk to them. other than that the case is very nice."
"I've been using this daily. I replaced all the separate chargers on my desk with this USB charger. It does get a bit warm when I have 3 tablets all charging at once,but so dar so good. I like its compact size and the way it stands vertically and the power led indicating its on.. I am curious as to know long it will last given how warm it gets. I will update if it has any problems, but happy so far."
"I love this case. Very thin and shows off the very cool gun metal backing on the phone. You can hardly tell it's on at all.The only reason for the four stars is that it came emblazoned with &#34;made in China&#34; all over it. It isn't a big deal breaker issue for me, but if that matters to you, consider that."
Great to have these extras around.
Charges 3 dead phones.  Stand by power seems to last at least a week.  Works with apple and android.  Can't say enough about this phone  power rescue.
Good condition. Good product
Too small for BLU LIFE VIEW 5.2 screen
"Love this little guy.... this is the second one I bought.  We used it to death.  Actually my 4 year old bent the first one too far.  We love this product.  Many positions, does not tip easily.  I bought 2 more.  Everyone in the family is always looking for the ipad stand."
"Bought it for my wife and it seems to be a decent case, and she loves purple."
I made my own gps mount  adapter worked grate  glenn
"This is pretty good if you just need a bit of juice, but alot of style. This is the best looking battery case out there, but not the biggest battery to charge your phone. It does not fully protect the phone. It leaves the sides and top exposed. I would recommend this for people who just needs that little extra charge without compromising design. I would suggest either Mophie or UNUcase for more battery and better protection."
Excellent item and super fast shipping!
Exactly as pictured.  Fits like a glove.
Broke after about 45 days.
"i really enjoy the case, only problem i had was the stand piece comes off easily, within 2weeks of having it came off but otherwise the cover is good to have it."
Very disappointed.  This was likely a counterfeit item.  I bought 2 batteries. One could not hold a charge for more than a couple hours. The other had only about 70% capacity of a regular battery and a self discharge rate that made it unusable as backup.  I am disappointed with Amazon on this purchase.
not happy
"It is absolutely THE cutest case ever. I love it so much and I get compliments on it all the time. One flaw is that it can take in a certain smell and smell like that for a while, like I had a bonfire and I had it on and it smelled like smoke for a while, I had to leave it alone and let it air out for like a week or two."
i love it  i have had it for 2 weeks now and it has not faded like others state here i guess its just how u takr care of it
"I received this camera lens by GoGo Robots to review and I love it. I take so many pictures with my cell phone that this really comes in handy. I love the multi functionality of the lens. It helps with wide angles, like panoramic shots, micro shots and fisheye effect shots. It is really easy to use. Just clip it on the camera of your smart phone, I have the iPhone 6 plus and I have it in an otterbox, this lens fits just fine over my case. There is no need to take the case off and risk damaging your phone. It works just fine!  I like how easy it is to take on and off. Literally just clip it on and then unclip it off. It comes with a convenient carry case that fits in your pocket with no hassle. This is a great gift for any of your family or friends that love to post on instagram. It is also a great gift for teens that use a lot of social media. I love to have it on me when I am out with my kids because it does improve the pictures that I take with my phone. The lens comes with a 30 day money back guarantee, with no questions asked. It is awesome!"
Fell of 2 days after I put it on.
Case exactly like picture.  Was delivered rather quickly
OK phone for the price
3 or 4 charges per charge
"Junk, belt clip broke within the 2nd week, case fits the phone well"
Doesn't work
nice quality fit great. how much it will protect not sure. had for over a month still in super shape. prob. ships from like china takes a long time to get. but it was worth the wait for a fan who was at the last 3 shows!!!!!
It's backward. Very awkward.
Loved this case! Sturdy and very fashionable!
Fast shipping. Very good fit! Even come with a little key chain flashlight.
"This product is not worth the money,SCAM it is. GO burn your money else where, It crashes like your windshield. If there is a negative star, I would rated it as (-)."
nice for traveling
Wrong battery
Great antenna. Perfect replace of stock antenna
Good product. Strong magnet. Just a little worried if it would mess up anything in the phone.
"Fits the phone perfectly. Sleek; not bulky. Great for price.  Negatives: one side was warped at arrival, and it is hard to push buttons on side if you don't have fingernails."
Great case - I love it!
It stop's working less than a week
Love this. It keeps me moving. If I have been sitting to long it will remind me. I can keep track of my walking with this.
Got my case on time. Love it
"Perfect solar charger for so many things.  Comes with the rechargeable battery which I could fully charge in about an hour in bright sun.  I've been experimenting with charging my cell phone and iPad.  I like that I can have backup when power is out.  This will definitely come in handy when we hike and camp.  Excellent packaging, easy to use and well built."
I love it
"This product is great, but I was disappointed in the arrival time. Although it was only one day late, I wish I wasn't given such a specific date."
Product is very good and satisfactory.<br /><br />This seller's items are always welcome.
"my daughter loves it.  It was around three weeks for delivery, but that was the estimated date, so no surprise.  Good product"
"This Shield is not as easy as they make it sound to apply, the solution that you spray on the shield makes it very slippery especially for apple watches due to the curve edges of the watch, my protector looked ugly and didn't stay on, it just kept slipping off my watch till i just peeled it off and threw it away ."
I did not like this at all. Very bad. It seemed to be a case not just stickers also there are no holes where needed for camera area
Really enjoyed this for my trip to Hawaii. It was perfect for hiking and we got some great underwater pictures. The only reason for four stars was that the touch screen could be really sensitive or non-responsive. We had a few pictures we wanted to get but couldn't get to the app to take a picture in time. But my phone survived the trip and the lenses were a lot of fun. We took a lot of pictures that we wouldn't have been able to take otherwise. It was awesome on a 14 hour kayak trip and an 8 hour hike to a waterfall.
good for price
"I had expected the case to be flexible and the glitter to flow more easily, needed slightly less fine powder, ok.  Hadn't realized the time frame for the send"
The item was damaged and I couldn't send it bcck
Exellent product! Fits perfectly on my note5!
"Prompt shipping, great case!"
"Works OK.  The main reason I selected this model is the &#34;Locator&#34; feature it has.  The volume is too low to be heard from more than a couple of feet away.  If I am that close I can probably see the headset!  Will not always connect to my phone, requires turning the headset off/on a couple of times.  Not the quality and reliability I have come to expect from Plantronics.  This is my 3rd Plantronics bluetooth headset, may be my last!!"
Charges phone very fast
"This gadget is awesome! Didn't notice when I purchased it, but hell... Had myself a phone call in the shower! All around pretty awesome!"
"The concept is nice but it slowly fell apart in pieces, quality should be much better for the price. Would but again but only if quality was significantly improved/worth the money."
"So far good, still trying to get used to the set up. Does work better than my old unit"
"I purchased this for a Samsung Note 3 which has a low profile case. It's just too gooey and the slot is too short to hold a bigger phone. The phone falls every time I turn a corner but the pad stays on the dash without sliding around. I wouldn't use this to hold my phone face up on the dash because we get a lot of sun in our area and it would probably fry my phone.<br />It works great to hold my husbands iPhone 5s, my sunglasses and other items and if that's what I had purchased it for I would give it a 4."
Broke in 3 days
Nice comfortable and stylish watch wish it had a few more function's  but for the price you cant beat this watch
Save your money this cord worked maybe 10 times. The wire splits and is garbage!! And of coarse you can't return it because it a week past the 1 month warranty. Save your money!!!!
"Love this! I was looking for a well made and secure way of keeping my phone accessible while out on my bike. There are tons op options but this one caught my attention. It has the normal adjustable retention clamp that holds onto the phone just like every other product. But this one adds in another way of strapping it in as an added layer of security. The clamp itself has a strong hold and would do fine alone, however I love the peace of mind the extra layer of protection gives me. The straps are kind of a stretchy rubber that feel strong (no worries of breaking) and hold onto the corners of your phone. I have an iphone 6 and it fits great! I don't use a phone case or cover and it still holds strong. I've tested it on a samsung galaxy with case and it still fits fine. The swivel allows the phone to be turned and twisted however you choose and can be tightened so,it won't move. This is an awesome product and I would have this over any other!"
"The first one I received did not work. I'm running Android 5.1 and made sure all the settings were correct so that a picture was taken when the volume up key was pressed(the issue was not the phone or settings). I told the seller I had received a defective one and they said they would send out a replacement. After a big hassle with the seller the replacement finally did arrive and it also does not work. Don't waste your time on this, it's not worth the headache."
Love It.
Unsure why I didn't buy one of these sooner. It's very convenient since it allows me to charge all of my devices at once. Looking forward to bringing this on my upcoming travels!
"Great quality,love the color combo and appears to be very sturdy .<br />Most importantly , fits my Zik perfectly ."
These wires are very durable and a great value!
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
For 20 dollars these are outstanding speakers! Well made! Quality looks better than my much more expensive speakers. BUY THESE! At this price its a steal!
I use these all the time. Great sound.
Great buy
"hard to beat for the price. won't work on all cars i.e. 2nd generation Dodge Dakotas and the air vent clips are a tad fragile, I've been using on in my 2014 RAM 1500 for 6 months with no problem and I have the iPhone 6+in a OTTER BOX."
Solved my recharging issues.  Works great!
item works without any issues
Loved the case but it lost it's color within a week and a half so it looks cheap now
"Was just what my husband needed, he just broke the screen on his phone so this is a life saver."
I ordered it because I needed one to replace the one I had & it worked.
"excellent value I have used this on my Motorcycle,as security camera in my home (we caught the thief) ,batter will last all day+"
Broke the 4th day I had it and second using it
broke within two days of having.
Great case especially for a teen who drops phone a lot. This is  new one for iPhone 6. Looks great and price / shipping were excellent
"I have had this stereo for a few months. The bluetooth works seamlessly once paired. It will even control pandora.  It works great from a sd card. I have had a little trouble with the usb but had to reformat it and works fine. The only thing missing is an external microphone, when driving people have a hard time hearing me because it is internal to stereo."
Bad screen I don't like it 😤
Love it so pretty as seen in picture but of course u are buying a plastic cover so not made for providing much damage control but it can handle a few drops if need be
Great price so I ordered 2. We tried them and they're both fully functional with no problems. Nicely made and look identical to our Apple cables at a much lower price.
earpiece is ok but the clip that goes around your ear stinks. it only comes with 2 clips and they both broke i've only had this unit for a month. i do remove it from my ear everyday and i would think the clips would be more flexable.
"Good case, needs more space for cards."
Fast shipping! Easy to install and use to hold my phone instead of it slipping all over and losing it under my seat! Would buy more as gifts!
"These are equally as good as Apple's bands and a fraction of the cost! Just wish I could get more colors. I have tried several with the metal ends and they are nothing compared to this! Yellow, red, grey, brow, navy, royal blue are just a few of my requests! Please!!!"
Very kewl watch case covers for my new Apple watch. The price was super and quick shipping. I recommend this seller.
Fits great! Durable. I love it. Great price.
Wow! Great product.  Fast shipping.  Can't ask for more : D
Easy to install.  The rubber tabs provide a secondary line of defense and sense of security for when you hit those unexpected bumps in the road.
It won't stay charged for more than 4 hours even if I'm not texting or talking on it.  Every day by noon it is dead
"no 'device not supported' message, I've been using this charging cable for at least 6 months, no issues"
pretty
Good
"Looks great, well made worth the money."
Good headphones for the price.  Great Value.
"I love this case!!!  Being a fan of Tokyo Ghoul, I was hoping that I would somehow find a case for my phone that is from this anime.  I was extremely excited at finding this one.  It has all the characters, the art is fantastic, and it compliments my phone greatly.  I alternate between this one and my wolf wallet case for my phone, depending on my mood, but I absolutely love this!!!  The material is quite sturdy, it arrived in perfect condition, and it hasn't gotten damaged on me so far."
Charges slowly
"The arm band is really small. Barley fit arounds my arm. Besides that, works great!"
Thanks
"Update:  Yea, they'll replace the broken screen protector, but they charge you $5.99 for shipping (which actually cost them like $2.00 by first class mail) so now they have your credit card number.  Better off just throwing it away.  Really getting tired of getting used products from Amazon.  Had dirt in the adhesive, no microfiber cleaning cloth.  Can't get it to stick down to the screen at the bottom around the home button.  Really hard to hang on to this thing to get it positioned accurately on the phone.  Probably would help to put a piece of masking tape across the front to hold on to, and also take the phone out of any case you have it in."
Awesome. Better than I even could hope.
"I bought this for my wife for her birthday and she really likes it.  The only complaint I've heard about it is that the magnet isn't super strong, though because you can hold credit cards, etc. in there, that's probably by intention.  Overall, she still really likes it after having used it for a month."
Very good.
gifted to my sis in India...working fine
This phone worked for 1 week fine and after that started to reboot itself and to not recognize the sim card. DO NOT BUY IT FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!
Will be buying other colors!
Excellent
Great product. Works well. Good price.
I am on my 3rd one - after about a month the first one quit holding a charge. I was sent another one - same thing a month in quit taking a charge.<br />I must say the company has been great about replacing it. I have had this one for a couple weeks now and just took it out of the box today. It is taking forever to charge. The suction cup was NOT in the box as stated. I am NOT pleased with the product at all.<br />When it does work - it's great for what I want - to pair it with my iphone and listen to the radio at work. But if this one does not work _ I want my money back - I can not keep wasting time on this.
Attractive and protects my iPad mini well.
Great amp especially for the price says 1200 birth sheet says 1345 and I can sure tell
Charges my phones much faster than any other wall adapter I have. Not much else to say about a wall charger. Pretty much does the one thing it's supposed to do very very well. Build quality is top notch.
Goood
Price - great.  Ease of installation  - great.  Fit and performance - Great!  I'm not paying $50 for a high end brand name again.  This works just as well and if it gets scuffed or old looking it's cheap enough to just buy another.  Much easier than those not-really-a-warranty warranties the other manufactures profess to have.
"We bought your device for our son. He started cross country running for his high school. We loved the device because it tracked his sleep, he's not a good sleeper. It also tracked his workouts for cross country and at home. We would know how to tweek his workouts if we needed to. This past weekend he was at an event for school and his UP fell off his wrist. This has happened before but he would see it happen and catch it. This time he didn't notice that it had fallen off. It is now lost. We are very disappointed in the clasp on the bands. It was the perfect device for what we needed. I would strongly recommend changing the clasp to one that fastens better."
thank you
Case was cracked when it arrived and pieces have been falling off it already ordered another case from otter box
excellent product!
Broke within a few weeks
"Love my new OtterBox for my Galaxy s5 phone, its sturdy, with a clip on on the back, n has a locking system on it that locks into place . Awesome prouduct , OtterBox is the only case you will ever need."
Worked great!
Works pretty well.
Easy! As the title says this was the easiest protector I have ever put on. The instructions are pictures with text and very easy to understand which is a plus always. It gives you everything you need with an extra sticker to get those little bits that float on right before you apply. I like the tabs they give you so as to allow you to line up the protector and then stick them on and tab over the phone so you can fold the screen protector over and it stays lined up.  When I put this on I cleaned the screen with the supplied alcohol swab and then dried it with the supplied dry cloth I then removed the tab that protects the protector then stuck it on. Because of there process the thing just basically adhered it self to the phone. I bought two and the first one I didn't clean properly so there was one air bubble but with a little wiping it came out. It is very thick as compared to others I have tried and feels just like the phone screen instead of a cover. I really like it because of the way and that it goes on so easy. The fact that it is totally clear and feels just like the phone is perfect. I can't find anything wrong with this thing at all. The fact it is so cheap is another plus. Being that I just put it on I can't comment on durability but I think it will be fine because it is glass. I think I applied to both our phones in less then ten minutes and that was mostly cleaning time. Awesome!
Very nice phone case.
"Luv the Luvvitt.  Great protection, good color choices."
My daughter loves this case for her new phone. She loves the hidden credit card and cash compartment!!
I love it.
"Not wild about this product.  After being in the sun for a few hours, it appeared the panels began to delaminate."
The phone case is great! I recommend highly.
"Product fits the screen well and looks great. I had an issue with a crack in the screen, but they replaced it immediately for me, and were very nice."
Bought this for my husband he loves it and it really does protect your phone- I got one from my daughter for Christmas last year and love it really protects my phone I have a tendency to drop it now and again- no damage so far- knock on wood
Cute design and sturdy!
just a great case.
looks great and professional
I am confused. The next model iPhone has not even been released yet. How can this product already have reviews rating it 5 out of 5 stars? Bit suspicious if you ask me...
Could not get the old faceplate off to replace.
As advertised.
"Went on easy and works great! I have my phone in a wallet case and the credit cards sometimes indent the shield with letters, but it always heals itself. Also the day after I put it on, I noticed a bubble but remember reading that bubbles will disappear...and sure enough it did in a day or 2!"
good
Great product no problems at all and much better price for 2 than 1 at verizon.
Wow!  FAST charging time.  Seems like a high quality product.
"Works as promised - magnets powerful enough to hold a Nexus 6 without any issues.Have not seen any magnetic issues impacting the phone or contents.<br /><br />I have one gripe though, the front rotating plate falls off after a few rotations - I guess I was turning the phone in only one direction only after attaching it. It screwed back on without any problems, however, i cannot tighten it without piercing the rubber center to get to the head of the screw.Techmatte should place a stop not to allow the front plate to turn 360°."
"If you want a clear case to still see the true look of your phone while still having some protection against scratches and small drops at a reasonable price, this is the product for you. It's cost-effective, fits perfectly, and still allows you to see the actual iPhone itself. The built in caps for the audio jack and lightning port are great as well to keep dust and lint out while the phone is in your pocket.<br /><br />This case won't be the most rugged or perfect case you'll find, but for the price it works as expected."
Poor
Works well. As described
"I LOVE this little gadget!! I have a Samsung Galaxy 5 and it fits perfectly. It clips over the top of the phone, to cover over the eyepiece. I just started experimenting with the fish eye lens (photo attached, don't judge!)  : )  -  makes a great, super affordable gift! I've given two of these away as gifts and both recipients thought their new little phone camera lens kit was the coolest thing ever. Comes with a cloth carrying bag... easily fits into a pocket or small purse compartment."
For the price its a bit too much they feel and look cheap... And to top it off they sent a different style than the ones you see in the picture... But they work right out of the box...
crap
"Wish it had a hole for the back camera while its flipped open. Edit: I realized the reason my phone was not getting connectivity properly to my wifi was due to this case. After I took off the case, I had absolutely no problems. However, with the case, I had issues staying connected to wifi."
Works as advertised.
exactly what the doctor ordered.  Lots of length and works with the Apple Ipad.  I say this because sometimes this aftermarket stuff isn't compatible.
"Great product, works well, fits secure - dad was happy"
Working nicely so far!  Good buy.
Good quality
REALLY BEAUTIFUL!!
I bought this screen and it worked but my Touch ID stop working now I have to discard my iPhone 6
Broke after about a month using it and couldn't get bubbles out of it after it was placed on
This cable is poor quality and 39&#34; long (not 4ft as advertised).
Worked great
Great
Good Morning. you can tell me if the radio brings support for putting the vehicle? (Nissan versa 2009)
I bought this a few months back. This charger worked perfect for a few months. Then we go to unplug it from the wall and part of it broke off in the outlet.
Prefect:)!
As advertised
Phone case arrived on time. Great quality. Works well
Great screen saver and easy install.
Pretty decent phone for the price
Thank you
It was great. I love it!!
"If it falls on its back or side it will be ok,  but it definitely does not have raised edges to keep the screen from touching the ground. The screen jets out pretty far past the case so it's really only half protected it it drops."
"I have to say I'm very impressed with this case.  It's definitely on the thin side (but not the thinnest), yet I think provides sufficient protection.  I ordered 3 different cases based on reviews (all very good) and this one is one of the top two.  Probably the top if you want to combine protection, yet being thin.  When I received it, I actually though they sent the wrong one.  (It looked like one piece).  It was just slightly challenging to get on, but as one reviewer stated, I started at the top and worked my way down.  I can't decide if the little cover on the power slot will be annoying or if it's a great idea to keep out pocket lint.  At least you have the option of cutting it off.  For the price, the protection and reasonable thin-ness of this case, I would definitely recommend."
LOVE LOVE LOVE IT
"The phone came earlier than expected! Honesty, I don't know what else to say. I usually don't leave ratings or reviews, but this time it's worth it. Besides, the rating should speak for itself. GOMAB"
"Worth the price, high-end radios."
"looks cheap, feels that way too."
This case is perfect for my Kindle Fire and costs a lot less than some of the other ones.
"Same troubles as others with the charger cover. Seems a little loose on the bottom of the phone, but this is a very thin case and is good for small drops so the phone does not get scratched. These phones are big of course so a thin case is nice and this one is priced nicely. Comes with a film cover for the back also to keep sand or dust from getting in the case from your pockets and scratching up the back of the phone."
"I use on my iPhone6, and it fits just fine. I use the air mount, which I like because it's easy to remove whenever I'm not using it."
Works well.
We bought the 3 pack and only one of the three cords included worked correctly. One of the others works if a specific side of the connector faces up. I would not purchase this brand again.
I tried to use this map on a 7 day backpacking trip in Glacier national park. Sometimes the maps didn't work when too close to the Canadian border? I would recommend using a map instead and leaving your GPS at home for back country backpacking in Glacier.
"works well. comfy, fits the case too! iphone 6"
"Good cassette adapter.<br />My husband and I just bought a Subaru OUtback 2002 with CD and cassette players.<br />We were afraid to try this to plug our cell phones into the car stereo, because some reviews say that it completely damaged the car sound system, but so far, we've been using for 4 days and , it has been working in a very good way.<br /><br />The only thing that I didn't like, which prevented me for putting 5 stars, it was a small interference sound when I move the cell phone. That is all."
Works great...
Out of sight love it thank you😜
I love  jl audio makes good amps
Good phone for the price.
Love the color combo..
Does exactly what i need it to do and that is charge my phone.
It's cute this is my second one just try not to set it and take good care of it
broken in two months
"It's not the most elegant looking Bluetooth, and the rubber ear pieces don't work very well,  but the battery life is AMAZING."
"No the greatest phone, better than iPhone 4 for under 100 and how cool the phone looks, great deal."
Very nice.
"battery performs as needed, but it's not the Official Genuine battery. It does not match the battery that came with my phone, which was purchased new from a Verizon dealer."
"Great concept, love having all the different cord styles all in 1 convenient cord. Took this traveling and it was so easy to charge our devices. My only grip is when 2 devices were plugged the charge was slow for one or not charging at all until the other device was fully charged. Wish you could charge multiple devices quickly at once but besides that I love it."
It's awesome
Had been looking for some sort of holster to cut down on &#34;pocket calls&#34;! This clips on ok but is a little bulky due to the size of the Note 2. But no more unplanned calls going out!
"Fits on the vent of a 2003 nissan frontier fairly well. The best out of three that I had tried. Holds Droid Mini well although tends to depress the volume down button. I use this in other cars when needed, and it always fits in the vents."
"It works! That's really all there is to say. Still functioning as of August 30, 2015."
Fast shipping. Exactly as described.
Great phone for the price!  Easy to use!
This is an easy to put on and remove phone case for the HTC Desire 626. My wife loves the purple color and the sparkly rhinestones. It has a nice lip to protect the screen and the soft-touch rubber is very non-slip.
I love this so much. It makes using my GPS on my phone so much easier. I love how this one angles as to some of the other ones like it that are stiff. This makes it much better if you have a car that has your air vents at a slight angle. Also if I need to call someone I can put the call on speaker phone and this will hold my phone leaving my hands free to drive.
alsome cases.
This is an amazing product.  I have been very impressed with the charging time.  It is also very easy to transport using the caribeener hooks included.
excellent product!
LOVE THIS STAND!  It is the perfect stand to watch TV at my desk at work.  Made very sturdy and worth the price!
Worked right away with my wireless charger. Shouldn't have been so darn expensive but I'm glad to have it!
Great
Is rubbing off
It was a really helpful device
Easy to set up and use. Great functions for the price
Looks good but it won't give much protection.
"I bought this for a trip I was going to go on and I took it out of the box and plugged into my iPhone 6 and it did not work, also tried it on an iPhone 5s and I didn't work as well maybe I got a defective one but it did not work for me, very disappointing."
Happy
"I got it and had to return it because I realized that it wasn't going to protect my phone as well as the otterbox has been...I like the design, but this color is a lot more neon than it shows in the picture. If I could do it all over again, I would go with the light blue I saw somewhere else on Amazon. The back is really slippery, not a lot a grip, but not horrible!"
"Clear sound and works great with my phone, laptop and tablet! Love it"
"Cannot find a cover for it anywhere, hard to text with long finger nails and it froze when speaking to rep at Tracfone and now lost all my contacts and pictures of my grandkids, lost everything on the phone! It is being replaced by Tracfone but information on the phone is gone,"
"Got this case for my sister, this is her review<br />&#34;My LG G3 came with the circle cutout flip case but I wanted something with real edges to protect the screen. This case is both functional and looks great. I've had it for a month now. I've dropped my phone on the corners, on its back, and face forward and the phone is unscathed. The back does scratch but it doesn't subtract from the overall aesthetic and what is a case for anyway. It's easy to put on the phone but harder to take off(I couldn't get it off until about a month after I got it). That's not a bad thing because I had another case that got super loose within a few months. The case also provides great grip for this slippery phone. The holes are perfectly sized I can fit all my cables into their ports and still use the infrared laser for the remote. The case makes the phone a fraction of a centimeter wider but it's barely noticeable. I got the gold version of this and I was a little worried how it would look but it's a subtle car gold and I've gotten tons of compliments on the color and overall design. I really like it, would recommend.&#34;"
Awesome product!!!
"I want to rate this product 5 stars but I can't. The product will not hold up an S6 at any angle at all without falling and the arms do not grip.<br /><br />I would normally make a note that the claw is hardly one,  etc,  etc but the young lady apologized and even sent one of her new design but the arms do not hold any better and the individual pieces fall apart now.<br /><br />I am rating this a 2 star as the owner really did try and if she can fix the design I would change it to a 5 star."
Very easy to apply and so far I'm extremely satisfied
The thing that holds my gopro in place snapped within 2 month of ownership. Good thing I did not lose my gopro! At first I have nothing but good things to say about this product but in time I realized it is the same as all the cheap quality selfie sticks I have seen. Go spend a little more money just to get the best quality.
It was below my expectation
Very good.
I bought this over a year ago and have used it flawlessly several times camping and when the power goes out to charge my phone.  I like it so much I'm buying another one.
"Just what I was looking for to carry my Garmin eTrex20, fits well, keeps it a bit safer and secure in my bag."
They work great!!! The price is fantastic....
"I tried to scratch it with a knife.  I could not.  It went on easy. Bubbles practically eliminated themselves.  Make sure you place it high enough so that the top edge is above the front camera. Very tight tolerance and I put mine on a little low but luckily not too low. I also seem to have put it on slightly crooked, best evidenced in the photo of the lower left corner.  Curved screens on mobile phones is all the rage but it sucks for screen protectors.  This one does a fine job. It covers every pixel on the screen, left to right, and beyond top to bottom. Glare is not too bad. It's difficult to see fingerprints. It's easy to clean if you do get a smudge on it.  Very happy."
I love it!!!
"Awesome and fantastic screen protector for Galaxy Note 2. Very easy to apply, shipping and packaging was great."
"exchange for a review, and my nephew has wanted one. We tried another type previously and weren't happy. This one feels really high quality and has worked without flaws. It's not flimsy. The telescoping extension works great. I'm super pleased with the bluetooth capability. I do recommend this purchase."
Loved the fit and the idea of a case but when I took it off there were little scratches where it had rubbed on the SS.
"Fast delivery. Amazing case, fits my phone perfectly and gives it an even more simple yet attractive look. Caseology always delivers."
"Says its compatible with an iPad 4, but it will charge for a few minutes, then I will get a message that this accessory is not compatible with my iPad. All 4 cables do this. Wasted $12 on this junk."
Received cable 4/15. A short time later the end piece had to placed in a specific way in order to charge my phone. Cable completely stopped working 8/30. cable looks nice and seems to be heavy duty but nah.
Great product for the price.  Hope it lasts.  Time will tell!
"I keep these in my car, briefcase and even 1 in my wallet. If I need a charge its usually not too difficult to find a micro USB."
"Quick delivery,very nice cables/good build 👍😃"
"I was looking for a way to charge my devices while out on long weekend camping without access to any electric, and this has delivered exactly what I needed!!!  Simple, and easy to use.  Just charge it until all the led's light up, and it's ready to go!  Plug your phone etc. in with your USB cord and before you know it they are fully charged!  Very sturdy construction, and even after charging my iPhone(which was almost dead), it still showed a full charge!!!"
"These were a huge hit! I got these for the kids on vacation. The bags are well made of quality materials, and the kids were able to film themselves underwater. This added a whole new dimension to vacation pictures! Pictures and videos underwater were clear as a bell. More important, we didn't have to worry about wetting or scratching the phones during our outdoor activities, and there was no arguing about where and when they could bring their phones.."
definitely the best phone case i've ever purchased. it's really high quality and protects my phone really well. i've dropped my phone a lot in this case and it has stood up well to the impact. the colors are really vibrant and lovely!
Very good product the charging is perfect. Anker is my favorite brand of electronic products all the way.
I was somewhat unsure about ordering another micro usb cable on the internet but my other one stopped charging. I was happy to find out that is is doing great job and it isn't very short. I will definitely look for this company to purchase mine again.
My case arrived when they said it would and the quality is great. I love my new case.
Just got it in this morning and installed it so far so good my s4 if charging right again and it was simple and quick to install and it arrived right on time
works pretty good everyone says they hear me fine
"Earplugs cord is very small,always face problem while talking on phone"
"Although this is a very attractive case, I don't like it as much as the case I had for my Samsung Galaxy S4.  That one was shock-proof, whereas this one is not. However, this one is very attractive and slim. It has a good grip, so your phone doesn't slip around. It's exactly what I ordered, but I wouldn't trust it to protect the phone against a drop off of the kitchen counter or anything."
"I love this phone case, so smooth!"
This is the best portable charger I have ever used. It charged my galaxy s5 4 times and my galaxy s4 once all in one charge. It has been great!
"I read all the reviews and the issues about echo and I have not experienced any issues with it.  If you are on the road like I am and you can use a device like this when at a client site or in your hotel, you can't go wrong.  Just get it.  The volume range is great and using it is very easy."
I'd guess it's ok.  But it falls off every 5-10 minutes.  So far I'm able to notice it.  Or someone else does & hands it back to me.
"I found the case for the most part to be a great buy! The only issue I had was it fid fog upbsome being in a hot humidg climate. I did not submerge for long periods under water, I still felt nervous doing so. I did a test before hand however with paper towel in case under water for a longer period and it remained completely dry. All in all I was very pleased with this product and had several people ask me about it."
CAN YOU SAY &#34;BLING&#34;?  These covers are so pretty and affordable you can get several!!
Tha box alone is worth it
"I ordered these cables because I am constantly replacing my wife and kid's cables. These cables are standard length and the fittings on each end are molded on and have a firm strong feel to them. The cables are a nice rubbery feel to them. They don't tangle easily.<br /><br />I saw some reviews where there are claims the cable is slower to charge a phone or tablet. I did some testing and found that the amps are just slightly less than the stock cable that comes with an iPhone. I see the difference is not that much. The cables registered about .1 amp lower than the stock cable. Based on the results, the cable charge speed will be very close to the stock cable.<br /><br />I received a discount for my honest review. I am grateful to be given the opportunity to review these cables. I find that they are more than adequate for my needs and they do as advertised."
"Love the case but as others commented earlier you have to modify the charger port access with a dremel. But its the only case i could find that had everything i wanted, mainly a screen protector, i an very satisfied with the case and will buy another if this one ever breaks. Oh yeah ive been using it for over a year now in very condition imaginable."
Fits great. Get tons of compliments.
"I liked and recommend to other customers b/c is nice-looking. I'd used for 1 month, it met my expectations."
"The selling point for this power bank is its portability; it can easily be kept in your pocket, purse or backpack to be carried with you: 5.5 inches long, 2.75 inches wide, about 1/4 of an inch thick, and it weighs in at about 5.3 ounces per our postal scale.<br /><br />Interesting device. Operating this battery is a breeze -- just charge it up and then connect it to your Apple lightning compatible device with the built-in, very short lightning cable.<br /><br />This unit is priced at the top of the range for a power bank with 3200mAh capacity, especially since it's output flow is under 2.A (1.6A rated), and it can only be used to charge devices that use a lightning connection. Would recommended it if you are looking for a super portable power bank like this, just to have in case of an emergency.<br /><br />Extremely portable; if you are looking for a battery pack of this size, style and capacity, for use as I have described above, then give this thin lightning compatible power bank a try.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing's review reflect that testing experience."
Fits my CD player and holds my iPhone 5s well. Love it.
Exactly what i wanted. I love it.
Fast shipping. Charge does not last as long as previous batteries
"Waych performed as exoected, good buy"
I purchased as a replacement battery for a 5yo device. Item arrived quickly and undamaged. But if you own this device don't bother with replacement.  Clear was sold to Sprint about 2 years ago. I received an email in April 2015 stating they will no longer be offering the Clear WiFi service after October 2015.
Purchased one months ago. Liked so much I purchased a second.
Good
Thank you for your dealings and goods Good
"I'm very happy with this purchase.  My old iPod/iPad wires would constantly stop working because they would get bent out of shape.  This wire is flat and tougher, so I'm hoping it's going to last a long time.  I also like the 6 foot length because it's better than the short ones my Apple products came with. My son loves it so much and he has been using it for his iPad, so I'm thinking of ordering another one just for me."
"You must do a little research on these before successful use though.  The firmware is very similar to UV-5R and is essentially a repackaged UV-5 platform with dual PTT.  The issues with the UV-5 were not corrected in this variant, but it is cheap enough and is an effective rig in amateur service once you are familiar with most aspects and issues common to the Chinese radios.<br /><br />The primary (common to all 6x 82 series radios I have purchased) problem with this is the programming cable connector.  One cannot moidify the cable end to make it work on these radios.  You have to hold the radio connector tight to the radio with your thumb, regardless if the cable mod has been performed or not, to get it ti upload or download.<br /><br />The one anti-gripe I have with this radio is that it is advertised as a 7W HT, when in fact it is 8W on VHF and 7W on UHF.  I am not sure why this fact isn't advertised better."
"Other than I cannot figure out how to delete items from this telephone, it works great"
"Easy installation, no bubbles after placing on the screen. This is not my first IntelliArmor screen, so I had experience installing the product on an IPad. The screen covers the glass, but there is about 1/32 of an inch all the way around the phone glass not covered. If you use a case, the sides of the case will cover the glass not protected by the screen. Overall the product and customer service will keep me coming back."
"Good smartphone, for Venezuela"
Work great with the GPS on the bike and I would definitely buy from this company again
The vibrate switch would not toggle with this case. I had to order a new one. All other features of the case seemed ok.
"works well, and was reasonably priced"
"This review has taken me a while to write,first I gave this phone as a gift to my father. He is over sixty years old and has little to no tech savvy when it comes to cell phones. I wanted to get him an unlocked cellphone so he would not have to worry about the price tag or when he decides to change carriers. He absolutely loves this phone. First of all, the screen is HUGE, I have a LG G2 and it makes my screen look small. It comes in very cool colors and it is actually quite sleek. The apps and software on the phone are not to bad. So if you like having a nice cellphone, but you may not be too tech savvy this is definitely for you. Also, the phone is an amazing deal. You get a great, stylish phone, and you get a screen protector, as well as, a cell phone case. This phone is truly great. When my father went to go get a sim card and showed it to one of the employees, the employee fell in love with his phone. Honestly, I would have gotten this phone for myself if I had known it was so cool instead of paying $400 dollars on my LG.  This is a most definite yes, If I could I would live to advertise this cell phone and the brand"
Didn't work out the box. Why take the chance?
"I live in the upper Northeast and started looking at solar chargers last winter, after we had an ice storm that knocked out power for almost a week!"
good price
So I have had the phone for nearly a month now and I will try and make this short.<br /><br />- Battery lasts a long time and charges fast.<br />- Screen is clear and bright.<br />- Touch screen could use some improvement. It works but sometimes you have to press harder than normal to navigate due to sensitivity.<br />- The OS is a older format and isn't as refined or user friendly as newer versions.<br /><br />Overall this is a really good phone. Can't beat it for the price. Yes there are a few things I wish were better but you get a lot of bang for your buck with this phone. Its perfect for someone on a budget or need a everyday &#34;beater&#34; that just works day in and day out. If your wanting something fancy or into having the newest gadget then your better off paying five times as much for what will make you happy.
"I always go outside at night and although I have lights around the house there is one corner which we fail to install a light fixture. I've been thinking about get a motion sensor light for a while, so when I received this Solar motion sensor light free of charge to test it and share my honest opinion, it was heaven sent. This is a compact light, but don't be fooled by its size because it does brighten when on! It has 4 LED lights and it is solar charged, therefor you only job is to install it where you desire and just enjoy it! The seller is nice to send you a set of screws and mollies and a hook pin with it. Works great  and I am thinking I need to order a few more for my trees towards the end of the property where my dogs cruise at night. Great MPOW product as usual."
"I hardly ever respond to invitations to rate a product  but this one I had to. The first  week I accidentally dropped it and the cover broke off.Could not reattach it.Then I noticed that it does not charge sufficiently at all.i.e,it might charge maybe 50 % from a 30% deficit and that's being generous. It would have made more sense if it had been designed to charge both devices at same time. In short this was a waste of money. DO NOT BUY!"
dgnjmmg
Did not like these one ear was louder then the other did not stay in my ear
still learning everything it can and cant do
"The cable works as advertised and feels sturdy and well made.<br /><br />I've removed one star because, like most short cables, it is more expensive than it ought to be.  I can justify the additional expense because I appreciate having a short cable in my travel kit.  I use mine in conjunction with an external HDD enclosure and the product has worked reliably."
Things kick ass recommend an amp 100%
Great price and perfect fit!
excelente producto!!
"Heat makes the GPS fall off, so you have to re stick it."
"holds 3 cards max, comfortably two cards , have had it over 3 months so far and no issues of cards slipping, protects my phone and not slippery."
Very happy with product
"I have used this dash camera for several months , it stll works well. that is the point I am here to write a reveiw after several months . the resoution is good to me .Day or night version  is acceptable , you can see clearly what happed in front of your car and other car license number  as the price and quality , I do not think other camera is better than this pc. I have bought GS8000 as before , but after 15 days when i used , I shipped back to amazon , the quality is disastering , the screen always get blank then you can do nothing . love this pc and reconmend it to my other family."
Rearview camera never worked. I actually purchased two one for me and one for my co worker. I waited to long to hook them up to get a refund. But now I got some cool license plate decor..<br /><br />PS my coworker's never worked either.. But for 12$ we didn't feel like asking for a refund.
Great item!!
thanks
Not to happy with this one.. item was returned.. wrong description.
"The case is great but I wish that I could find it without the holster.  I bought a similar case without the holster for my iPhone 6+ Last November, bit I couldn't find it on Amazon when I went to find the same case for my wife's phone.  Regardless, the case is worth getting and just throwing away the holster, which I did."
Greatest
I totally agree with the previous 1 star reviews. This battery will not hold a charge for even a day. I switched back to my nearly year old OE battery cause this on lasts only about 6 - 7 hours on standby.  Junk.
"Purchased this to use with a Raspberry Pi. Makes a nice little portable system with minimal reconstruction. Just need a HDMI and USB adapter and you're all set, plug in the Pi and go."
Great sound! iPhone 6 works great with!
I absolutely love this phone. The user interface the sleek design the battery life all is exceeded my expectations.
"Easy to put on, doing a great job of protecting my phone and making the screen easy to clean off fingerprints.."
"This is far and away the best Bluetooth headset I have ever owned for the purpose of working out. Let's start with the most important attribute for this niche: does it stay in your ears? I guess there are individual differences, results could vary, but in my ears at least it is as though the creature from Alien has attached itself but probably a little more comfortable (I don't know about wearing them for hours and hours but for a typical 60 minute workout they are more than comfortable enough). They stay in place even when running, even when getting very sweaty, perfectly fine in dynamic moves, functional fitness suspending upside down, whatever.... You do sometimes need to fiddle with them a bit to get them to sit properly at the start but once they are in, they are in.<br /><br />Next factor is audio quality: it is not audiophile level but IMO the best wireless sound I have experienced (though I have never sought out Bluetooth headsets primarily for sound quality) and more than enough for the kind of environments it would typically be used in: Bass is a little heavy but not overpowering, sound is clear and there are many wired headsets that would fall short.<br /><br />Noise isolation: simply put: very good. Possibly too good: you won't hear them coming. I personally prefer more ambient noise to be allowed in to make them better for running. Also you do get that &#34;internal sound amplification&#34; when you are running because they do make a seal with your ears. Therefore, they are definately better for workouts over jogs, but functional for either.<br /><br />Bonuses: spoken feedback &#34;Power on&#34;; &#34;Connection Successful&#34;; &#34;Battery low&#34;. Battery power indication on the iPhone (never seen that before, maybe I am getting old but seemed very nifty to me). That power indication is a little optimistic though, unlike the voice-nag that will start telling you &#34;Power low&#34; every few seconds about 10 minutes before the battery runs out (it is not the worst in this department though).<br /><br />My only major gripe with this headset is the button placement and function: firstly both sides have the same grooves, so that by feel you can't easily tell which side has the buttons on it (should I be able to remember that the buttons are on the left? Sure, there's that getting old again. But if, like me, you can't remember what side of the car your gas tank is on after 8 years, you will struggle with this). Secondly, it is hard to locate the gap between buttons such as volume/next-prev track and stop/start. As a consequence, I find it fiddly to control volume and tracks from the unit itself and I tend to just go to the phone to do it. Depending on how easy that is for you, the button position could get annoying. I can live with it, but it is not &#34;the best&#34; in this category.<br /><br />Waterproofing: tested once by putting it (accidentally) in the washing machine. Alas, my unit did not survive this, but personally that was not within expectations. So that is the limit. In terms of rain/sweat seems fine. But I wouldn't use it while paddling or anything.<br /><br />Battery life: is excellent and is as good or better than advertised.<br /><br />Finally, it is a possibly a poor hands-free (so says the only person I ever called on it). But I didn't care enough about this feature to really test it extensively (I like hearing that I have a call coming but happy to switch to the phone at that point and not use the headset while driving). Read other reviews if you intend to use it extensively for making phone calls as this possibly a serious shortcoming (if you need this).<br /><br />Well done Photive for a great and very well priced headset.s not the worst in this department though).<br /><br />My only major gripe with this headset is the button placement and function: firstly both sides have the same grooves, so that by feel you can't easily tell which side has the buttons on it (should I be able to remember that the buttons are on the left?

"Solved my issue of charging my iPad, personal and work cell phone without a powerstrip. I Velcroed the PowerPort to the back of my nightstand and with some cable management, works perfectly and looks great without wires freely hanging everywhere."
"This came packaged perfectly and it was exactly what I wanted. It fit the phone perfectly and, looked wonderful."
Works great
Did not fit the way we were expecting them to.
Great seller. Fast delivery. Product as described. Thank you!
These are inexpensive and they work great. I love them. They last the length of the phone.
The seller did exactly what they said they would. I have already dropped my phone on concrete since I have had this case and it protected it like it should.
"works great, excellent price"
There's a lot of good reviews for the suede leather band so I made the purchase. However the black leather band looks cheap flimsy. I think it's far the from quality of the apple leather band that I tried on.
"Looks great on our end table. It is extremely easy to set up, more useful to hang up the watch."
Cracked in a week.
Works really well. Good purchase. Fast shipping.
Got this for my boyfriend.  He loved it.  He is an auto mechanic so the case had to be tough to withstand being at his job.  It's been a month and the case still looks brand new
Exactly what I needed. Works great
perfect condition<br />Thank You!
Great screen protector.
"I didn't end up using it in the rain, but my niece got a hold of it and it is the perfect mock phone for a baby!"
"My iPhone5 has a new life! My screen had started coming off, and after an internet search I suspected that the battery was swelling. I thought I'd take a chance on this since it's way cheaper than getting a new phone or having this repaired.<br /><br />There were some bumps along the way. For example, I initially removed the screen without the frame around it. You have to lift up the frame as well in order to get to the battery. Unfortunately I broke part of the frame while trying to pry it open. Removing the battery was actually fairly easy despite what youtube videos suggested... I think the key is to pry it up from the left side just like the included instructions show.<br /><br />In the end I powered on the phone and it had about half a charge left, which is great. The whole phone snapped back together and looks pretty much good as new. The battery seems to do a decent job of holding charge. Overall, great experience, really cheap solution."
"Best FM transmitter that I've purchased, and the USB port is really useful."
"Had a rough edge out of package. Didnt think anything of it, except the edge developed a chip and has now turned into a hairline crack. I didnt even have a chance to drop it as Ive only had it two weeks."
The best
This is a nice cover for the new Samsung Galaxy 6 edge plus. It's nice and slim so it doesn't add any bulkiness to the phone. It's not a hard cover but if you want to keep the phone nice and sleek this cover is a must.
good product
"I was a bit worried when ordering this as I read some of the comments stating this case did not fit properly. There were also comments stating the back of the phone needed to be removed in order for the case to fit properly. I found neither of these statements to be true.<br /><br />The case fit snugly with the original back on the phone and all buttons worked properly. I think the reason for the reviews stating the case did not fit is simply that this case is for the 1st generation Moto E released in 2014. If you are unsure which case you have, you should check your model number to be certain before ordering.<br /><br />I am 100% satisfied, and received my case one day earlier that expected. Would recommend to anyone with a 1st generation Moto E that needs more than just a soft silicon case to protect against drops."
"3 ft is perfect length for front seat access, but not for back seat works great and sound is clear, and is also easy to store since it will not get tangled easily"
"perfect fit, and heavy duty, great case for the note 5, pair it up with a glass shield and your phone is protected for everyday use."
"I really like this case, it fit perfectly and everything lined up exactly. I think it should do a nice job protecting my phone."
"no, no impact at all after I installed this filter<br />useless for my car."
"Works as intended for rapid charging of multiple devices. A bit bulky, but to be expected by a 3 USB car charger.<br /><br />Shipped quick and works as expected. Overall, 5 stars."
"This product was advertised as flush mount, but it sticks out of my car lighter socket by over an inch.  It would have been nice to get actual product dimensions on the selling page, but the only dimensions were the packaging."
Tech21 has the best phone protection that doesn't get stuck in your pocket and isn't too bulky. I cannot tell you how many times I have dropped my phone. Heck I even dropped it as I was walking one time and kicked it across a parking lot. Tech21 was scuffed up but the phone was fabulous! Thanks Tech21!
ok
Absolutely the best iPhone charging/data cable out there. It's durable and better quality than the original Apple cable that comes with the phone/iPod. I got the 6ft one and it's perfect for use in bed or connecting a docking station to your computer.
just a back up if i lose the original one
"Works well. Same as previous, Battery is difficult or impossible to replace."
Amazing phone!
What a great product! Charges on cloudy days as well although obviously takes longer. It is durable as well having accidentally left it in the rain one day. My son-in-law fell in love and bought one as well.
Great item at a great price and fast shipping!
Fit perfect and I love it.  I have ahd it for a couple of months already and it still looks new to me.
Haven't had the back up camera part installed yet but it works great as a mirror
great
This cord is already broken.
It's already breaking apart the plastic that goes around the phone is cracked and chipping apart. Will not purchase one of these again
Pay close attention. This is a cheap ballpoint pen with an eraser-sized stylus nub on the other end. No returns acceped.
"Yup, I should have taken the other low star reviews seriously.<br />I have never put on 1-star before, but this is the worst product I've purchased through Amazon.<br />This headphone, after working for about two weeks, would not work on the LEFT ear bud.<br />I really like the fact that the battery lasts over two days of on-off usage - so I won't complain about the Amazon not having the option of &#34;0&#34; star.<br />$27.99 and my time to write this warning review just went down the drain."
"Truley amazing, Beautiful Apple Watch band alternative. Official one is over $130. Took one minute to open and switch it out for my Apple Watch sport band.It's awesome and good way to save money!"
Cheap plastic & white everywhere except on the back  I thought it was going to be a black rubber cover for the price.  Highly disappointed.
Fits the phone well and is very sturdy. Does not add much extra bulk to the phone either. Very happy with this product
good case overall
case is very thin and provides very little protection against drops...!!!!
"Great quality case that looks great, too!"
"Works like it should along with a nice design, would buy again."
PROMPT SHIPPING AND JUST AS DESCRIBED.
"It gets the job done, as described, great buy for a solid brand name detector, very basic, but hook up and go."
Its awesome. Worth it.
Interestingly too big for the phone selected for but he's happy with it. So all's well!
you will need this when adding your own motors or needing to integrate with a reversing polarity system.
Nice product at a nice price.
good price and on time
It matches my beats headphones and I love Soo much!
Too much static
Best cables I have ever seen or used. Both my phone and tablet charge faster.
"My product started to peel off in the corners, but I emailed the company and called. They were super nice and replaced my back cover no questions asked!! Highly satisfied with my order!!"
So nice that the cables have connectors that are small enough to fit through the holes in my phone case. Good product!
"Is there any way to rate an item with MINUS stars? If so, I would rate this hunk of $#!+ a MINUS TEN STARS!!<br /><br />I bought this thing about a year ago in anticipation of converting all of my cassettes to MP3 when I retired. I tried to get this piece of garbage to work and it failed in every respect.<br /><br />I loaded the program from the disc and it instructed me to download iTunes, which I did. When I tried to initiate the program to start recording, I got a message that I again needed to download iTunes. I ran a repair program from iTunes to no avail. STILL WOULDN'T WORK!!<br /><br />Bottom line: I could not get my computer, using Windows 7 Pro, to recognize this thing in any way shape or form. I'm not going to send it back because I don't want some other unfortunate person to get this $#!+Y thing. I'm taking a 5 lb. sledge hammer to it first thing in the morning."
Best glass screen I ever bought.
Did not fit phone!
"I have had this case for a few months now and it still looks quite new.  In general, I am careful with my technology, but this case has survived a couple of falls (and successfully protected my phone).  The case is fairly thin, which I also appreciate since my phone spends most of its time in my pocket."
Works great!  Eliminates searching for multiple outlets to charge &#34;i&#34; devices.
Would have been great if I would have paid attention and gotten one that fit my tablet. They don't make them for the LG7 yet 😔
I could never get this item to work and i didn't use it until after 30 return policy expired lesson learned always test product immediately.
fits well and works well.
"pure crap!  Always remember, you get what you pay for.  Item didn't work out of the package."
It protects the back and sides well.  It is a simple design that functions well.  Nice case that does not add a lot of bulk.  It also makes the phone easy to hold on to.
Always loosing my headset and this is the best.  always buy this one
Works better than i thought it would!
Very nice product cancelled noise and good sound
All good. I ordered several of these and they are great.
"case broke almost immediately, ruining the waterproof aspect of it.  Would not buy again."
"it was my first selfie stick and Im happy with it, easy to use, easy to carry on my bag my phone fits perfectlyGreat"
"Can't beat these for the price. I've had them all. Sounds great off of the my pioneer 6700. I'm sure they would sound even better with an amp. If you were to spend money on an amp, do it right. Don't skimp if you want quality audio."
Case nothing like the picture presented. Very disappointed
Fit well but looked like water under part of the shield. I threw it away.
"Purchased for my Note 5. In fact I bought to of them, different colors because of the price. Fits the phone well and feels good in your hands. It is a thin case so I do not how well it protects the since I am very carefully with the phone. This is not an otterbox but I did not expect it to be that much protection. I like the style and the fit, easy to get on but a little difficult to get off, but that is ok if you don't take it off and on alot. Would be this again for my wife's phone when she is ready to upgrade."
"If you really want what's worth for your money, iSmooth screen protector is the right for you! From buying to installation was as easy as 1-2-3!"
"I just started using the stand. Nice design, very good cable way."
"Holds the phone great, but the rotation screw comes loose pretty often so the phone will twist sideways.<br /><br />Also somehow didn't think about the fact that this will permanently affect the little fabric that protects the cd player from dust and such."
Received this as a gift.  Phone attaches quickly and easily and feels secure. Only complaint is the telescoping pole is pretty stiff and takes muscle to push in and pull out.
Great picture quality
This one is working so far!! Had to send one back!! I love it!! Fingers crossed this one will keep working
I've had this in my car for a while now. Loving it so far. working great plus a sleek design as well.
"This case is beautiful, however it has a snap closure that you need to press down hard against the glass of the phone to close. Not a good design.  If it were a magnetic closure, I would have given this 4 stars, but it's not worth it."
"This is exactly what I ordered, and it is nice, but I don't know how secure my cell phone will be if I accidentally drop it."
Battery is great. Still waiting for the charger.
Great case!
These cables work as advertised
[[VIDEOID:5dc7ce00bc2f2b2a013997093480213]]I have been looking for high quality clear case for my phone because I have a limited blue samsung galaxy s6 and I really want to keep my phone safe but also see it's attractive color.  This phone case is anti scratch and anti dust.  The cover really is impact resistant and made of a flexible plastic that was really easy to install and yet durable at the same time.  I wish this one came with a glass screen cover but for the price of this case I cannot complain.  I'm 100 % satisfied.  I did receive this case as a promotion so that I may leave my honest unbiased review.
great little case.
"Very functional, and makes driving and using the phone much safer.  Never have to dig into my pockets to get my phone when a call comes in while I am driving.  With a Bluetooth set up and the Macally, it is truly a hands off phone use."
It stop working after one  (1)
"Good original batteries, and worked as expected!"
"I dropped my phone and this broke after a few times. But it is cheap and if you don't drop your phone as often as I do, then it will probably hold up fine. Love the design."
Meets all my expectations
This car charger seems to be very fast charging. I feel that it is much faster than my apple wall charger. I love how there are two ports incase my passengers would like to charge too. The white and grey is very stylish and I love the blue led which indicates it's charging. Very nice product!
"The tip is a little oversized, so it may not fit some phone cases."
Worth the money for a great privacy
"Great holding power, I use them with large phones, handheld radios and even my 10 inch Tablet without a problem. You can really bend the arm without a problem and it stays in place!"
This case is extremely thick and difficult to put on and remove. Makes the side buttons almost useless. I regret purchasing this case.
Perfect
These are cheap Chinese junk. They will not synch with the bluetooth system on my phone. They are poorly made I would not recommend them to anyone.
This is so cute! It fits my samsung galaxy s4 perfectly.  It stays closed well.
"Have had it for a couple weeks. works very well so far, although it doesn't seem to charge much faster than the original chargers. i will be doing some traveling in the upcoming months then I will know if it proves its value."

"No it was horrible, it wasn't the right color of what I expected."
"Simple wall charger with fold-out prongs. The build quality seems excellent and my Verizon LG G3 hasn't complained about it one bit. Charging speed may be a little faster. Stays much, much cooler than my old charger."
"We got this for our daughter & she loves the color & kickstand! Seems durable but we'll see if it lasts the whole school year. Regardless, the price was right."
Wonderful little speaker. I bought it for my wife's office and it is perfect. Easy set up and there have been no issues. Probably wouldn't use it as large room speaker but that is not what it's designed for.
This is my second purchase of the same product. Fits my ebook reader perfectly with a very reasonable price
"Fits  great, looks good, and seems to be as sturdy as similar cases such as Otterbox but far less expensive."
I use this piece with the mountek magnet it does the job pretty well but I wish they can provide an extra sided tape with it
Thanks very much!
Love the case! The only thing is that other chargers besides the IPhone one doesn't fit and you have to remove case to charge it.
its kind of hard to get the phone out its real tight
Very very very much satisfied.
Very well fitting case all button work only drawback is you have to remove phone back cover. But the protection it provides is well worth it.
"I have had other bluetooth headsets before, but none have worked as good as this one.  When I talk to people using this, they do not even know that I am on a bluetooth set.  That is how good it is.  I also stream music from my iPhone with this and the battery life will keep it going all day.  The phone battery life, not so good.  But that is because the cell signal is poor or low.  I do wear glasses so it does feel a little uncomfortable if the hard plastic &#34;clip&#34; is pressed against the ear a certain way.  I wish it could be made out of a softer material but then it may not last as well as the rigid plastic.  If your glasses have a thin piece that goes over your ear, then it should not give you any issues.  It is lightweight and the volume is loud, so you can hear it over loud noises.<br /><br />If you are expecting high fidelity music streaming, this does not provide it.  Definitely rather have it play music than not since I am not supposed to have music playing while I work.  (The LED does not light up when streaming music.  BONUS!!)<br /><br />I thought I had lost this a while back and the price went up $20.  I will buy another if the price drops back down.  :)"
Thanks
Cracked on the edge and cut my finger because it did not fully cover the whole samsung galaxy 6 edge. Used for 1 week
"I have very small arms and was pleased when I put this on and it fit comfortably. I was able to put my phone in the pocket with the case on which was also nice, as they can be difficult to get on and off. I have not gone on an extended run yet but so far am pleased with my purchase."
I bought this cover on Amazon after looking at all the reviews. Today my phone fell face down onto a concrete floor and the screen cracked. The point of impact was right on the side-edge of the case cover near the power button but the cover didn't absorb the impact. I don't recommend buying this cover.
stolen phone
It worked great glad I ordered it
Low profile and fast charger. Comes with the car charger and a 3' cord
Very nice product. Very well made. Works perfectly for me.
"This is my first time using a glass screen protector for my phone and I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />I opened it up and found a nice thick piece of glass that is free from any scratches or dust. I was able to get it installed on my phone quickly and easily, since the cleansing and drying cloths are already included in the package I had everything I would need.<br /><br />Once I got the screen protector on, I loved the fact that it is crystal clear and it didn't even look like I had added anything to my phone.There were no bubbles and I could still use my touch screen just like before. I really like knowing that I have the added protection now in case of bumps or drops. I received one to review and I can say with 100% certainty that it DOES WORK. Unfortunately for me, I dropped my phone shortly after putting the screen protector on. Luckily for me, thanks to this screen protector, my phone was completely unharmed. Very glad to have it!"
Very classy!
Great case at an affordable price
the case does not close completely around my telephone.
Same issue other people are having...the top snapped right off first time using. Returning it today!
Nice
"great super shield, keeps finger prints off and protects very well from scratches"
These cases rock.
Great protection for my iPhone. Not too bulky either.
Wrong case
"Have used this product for about two months now as my daily charger at work. Quality has been good, no experiences of not charging or being warned by iOS that the device is unsupported. Would (and probably will) buy this product again."
"Not as good as original battery.  Does not retain charge all day, even with minimal usage."
Broke within the first week😤
The glass was not a perfect fit but it has protected my phone nicely. I would suggest watching videos on how to install.
Is nice case
"Love it, period!"
Works great!
Great product... Never have to use a wall outlet when traveling.
meets my expectations
Phone did not work with this case on.  Quite disappointing.
"Simply Great, period"
It is great for the kids in the back where there is only one power port.  With this they can charge their tablets or smart phones on the road.
"This review is 2 years overdue, my apologies.<br />I actually purchased these for my best friend and she loved them. For as long as she had the phone until she upgraded to the newer Samsung Galaxy phone she only used one of the three screen protectors that this came with. They are that good that she didn't even need to use a second one."
"This is a great armband for my son to use his iPhone with. He loves to workout at the gym and take long runs. It fits perfect on his arm and the velcro stayed closed while he was running. Marsboy Armband is also waterproof.<br /><br />It is nicely designed and seems it will hold up very well. I did have another armband for him but it broke within a few uses. He has been using it now for quite a while and it looks great, stays in shape, and is easy to take his phone in and out. It is snug so he does not have to worry about it falling out. He likes this so much better while he works out than a regular waist band or clip. I received this armband complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.  Marsboy Armband"
"It fits my S5 mini phone but not perfectly, especially on the bottom, it doesn't attach very well"
good product works very well. Good service from seller
Good for the price
"Had the case for about a month before it started falling apart. The sides rip away from the back with casual use, horrible quality and would absolutely not recommend."
"The 1 star rating is because of the poor battery life.  As others have mentioned in their reviews, the batter will drain in 3-4 hours even without use.  If you use, it will drain even quicker.  I also have had trouble making calls--sometimes takes 3-4 tries to connect a call.  I've had several episodes where my phone just dropped the call in the middle of a conversation(can be extremely annoying).  On the plus side, for a prepaid phone it surfs the net reasonably well; it's do-able.  Overall, very disappointed."
Good product.
Good product
I would give this zero stars... it broke super fast...not happy with this product.
I've dropped my phone a few time snow and it's held up like a champ.  Now I can be clumsy and not feel guilty.
"Very cool design, but unfortunately lacking in quality and any form of protection. Lasted less than 2 days before the corner split from regular use. And I am extremely careful with my electronics."
So far nothing of what the direction has stated has been fact. I plugged them in to charge and the light never went from red to blue....it just went away. I tried pairing and have not been successful with that either..<br /><br />The directions are difficult to read and it appears there is no phone number for questions and help......
"Was not cheap made and I was expecting it to be because of the price. Overall super cute, great material and worth it!"
"Have had this mount for two weeks now and up until today I would have given it four stars.<br />However, riding on the new England roads presents challenges and gear has to hold up. This morning I hit a pot hole that nearly knocked me off my bike, the pothole did, however, knock the mount off my bike with the phone. Given the severity of the hit, I thought for sure my phone was done let alone having any chance of the mount holding up. Well to my surprise, the phone did not have a scratch , dent, or other mark from the incident. The backing of the mount had a few scrapes but otherwise intact. Not only was it intact but I was able to use the mount once I had rebooted my phone. I'm sold on this device."
"Purchased in January of 2014, and was used on my bike indoors once in awhile. Recently I decided to get serious about exercise, and started riding a lot more often. Starting in July 2015, I used the holder one hour a week indoors, and two hours a week outdoors on the actual road. On 8/30/15, I was riding and the entire unit along with my Galaxy Note 3 phone flew off the bike onto the road. Luckily it wasn't busy and I was able to retrieve my phone with no damage to it. When I investigated it, I noticed that the shaft of the mount that connects to holder to the handlebar had broken off!<br /><br />I took two photos, and have attached them to this review.<br /><br />If you do decide to purchase this item, be sure to use the stretch cord provided, in case the unit falls off. It's a good idea anyway, when using it on the road, because the vibrations on the road can cause your phone to come out, especially if you ride over a bump or hit a rough patch of pavement."
Cheap interface. Never worked with a Samsung Galaxy
This is not a protective case by any means. It is indeed slim & the corners snap flush with the phone. The sides (leather grip) does not extend around the phone. The plastic material feels flimsy & I don't feel assured that if the phone were to drop that the case would stand up to the impact.
"Looks like all the reviews EXCEPT the low rated ones are from users the received them for free, hell give me a pair for free and I will review them to. I sure ain't gona buy them..."
Get product! Fast shipment and good quality!
"Just recently purchased an iPhone 6 + and encapsulated it within Spigen' grasp. Great feel, great fit, protection yet to experience. Time will tell."
"Since my wife liked the design(5 stars), I bought two cases in a short period of time due to the 1st was cracked. The 2nd one was also cracked within a week of arrival. (-3 Stars)<br />... Highly not recommend this item."
"Fit: I've always had issues with in-ear headphones staying in my ears while I run.  I didn't want to buy anything too expensive, so these seemed perfect.  They do a decent job of staying in my ears while I'm running/sweating.<br /><br />Bluetooth Sound Quality/Range:  The Bluetooth range is pretty weak - no more than about 4 feet before I have connection issues.  Sound quality was a little better than I expected - but don't expect them to rival Bose/Beats/etc.<br /><br />On a side note, they do a great job of muffling the sound around you - so I would recommend being extra vigilant while you're running with these or leave one earbud out."
Sucks!
I love this so much. It makes using my GPS on my phone so much easier. Also if I need to call someone I can put the call on speaker phone and this will hold my phone leaving my hands free to drive.
It suited our purposes perfectly
I bought this almost a year ago and my phone hasn't been scratched at all. Which is pretty impressive because I drop it all the time. It's coming apart now but it lasted a while! Would recommend.
"I'll admit, I shower more now..."
"The cover image is too dark, and is bad quality material.<br /><br />Ps. The face of link is cut."
Cheaply Made. Breaks easily.
Liked it but broke in less than a month
good product
"works great, it is better than the one that came with the gps!!!"
"looks good, shows off the back of my (customized) phone. not sturdy enough to count on for too much protection, but better than nothing."
Fit's perfect
love how it holds the phone and keeps it from the sweat moisture
I do not have nething negative to say about my purchase it came quick which that was a plus
Great sound out of a little container. Works good with the phone and my Kindle. It was great to take on vacation to the beach. It shocked me when it paired to my phone. Great buy....
Works good and its worth $25
Great thanks!
"Very good quality, excellent fit of the phone into the holder. Looks very good, like leather and more durable"
This product is not as snug as the brand claims to be. It fits snug into the plastic part of the case but the outside flap is bowed and loose and not snug. Not the best quality and comes with a big price tag. I wouldn't buy this product if I had noticed that in a store.
Works great.
"I don't know if it's my phone or the item itself, but I am constantly having trouble connecting to this device with bluetooth (should have opted for a corded model). When it's working, it works great though - hence the 4 stars."
So far no problems but has some features that are not that easy to understand since I am not that cell phone smart. I hope I can figure out the issues that I am having.
already scratched my screen but no visible damage to screen it self. Easy placement and no bubbles
This is my favorite case. I broke the top part that snaps on and i decorated the back cover with expensive diamond pieces and i cant find a top snap on that will snap with this one. Is there any way you can make more of these? I also sell them after decorating them so i need more.
Kept breaking so I would say get the Amazon basics or a braided one.
"Loooooove it, great price, looks better then the pic. Fast service. I will sure recommend it. I'm a happy client."
"Pretty good quality for the price.  The screen protector was impossible to not have bubbles in, but that could just be me."
Great product. Keeps my husband's phone secure and safe!
Knock off.  Don't trust it to protect my phone
Bought this case for my daughters phone.  She seems very happy with it so far.
Great at first but didn't take long for the rubber to come that holds the phone in the clamps
"Very happy with this purchase. Unlike others, this charger works and doesn't prompt a warning message from Apple on my phone."
This selfie stick does not work with the Galaxy S 6.
These worked fine at first but after using them for a couple of days they stopped working. Not worth the money savings.
It doesn't slip and slide around when I start sweating.
"Hadn't seen this before but I love it.  And, it arrived weeks early!"
"fast delivery, Looks beautiful! Very happy with it!"
"Got two, love the sound they can produce. On my 2000 V6 EX Accord, this pumped brand new life into the speakers that I never thought was possible. One of my units is much dimmer than the other, however. Wish there was a brightness setting to adjust on these. It's mostly visible, but I'd appreciate having the option to adjust."
The phone lasted for three weeks before it started over heating.  I contacted Amazon buat was told it could not be replace because it was a gift.  I contacted the person who ordered for me. They tried to do a return but was told it was too late.  The phone is only three weeks old.
IT DOES NOT HAVE CC SLOT OR POUCH!!! SO UR NOT GOING TO GET WHAT IS DESCRIBED FOR THE ITEM!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED
"I was pleased with this item for about a day. the second day of owning this item, there was a weird, static noise that you could hear when music was being played. also there's an annoying ticking noise that you always hear between 2 second intervals every time the cassette is in the cassette player. I really do not recommend this item. I suggest buying a $10-$15 cassette aux player, that's actually worth it."
Great for 28v aircraft power systems
"Great purchase, quick delivery. Thank you."
"Of the portable speakers I've tried, this one has the best bass reflex. That is to say, it has the most BALANCED sound - it will vibrate a bit on the table, but will neither rattle things nor emit super-high frequencies that distress your pets. You hear a nice full-ranged sound without too much emphasis on the midrange. It's good enough that I use two daisy-chained ones as the primary stereo sound source for my PSP and several other portable game consoles. It holds a charge for a long time, in or out of use. Even if you don't use it for a month, you can plug it in and it's good to go.<br />One of the best. Better versions may have come out since, but if I ever want another portable speaker, it will probably be the one on this page. It just WORKS and its charging cable, unlike most other speakers', has an inline audio jack.<br />I recommend this portable speaker for indoor/porch/patio. It probably won't hack it at the beach or a party unless it's a quieter day or you have several connected to a LOUD audio source. I've driven it until it clips, though, and it's a musical clipping (sounds good, like old tape, instead of harsh like digital noise)."
Bought it to hold my sony action cam along with all my attachments...plenty of room and more!
"This would be a 4 out 5 star review, but......<br /><br />I've had my UP24 for about 6 months and it's been great until 4 days ago when it stopped working altogether.  I go back on here (where I bought it) and found that I'm not alone.  How can Jawbone make an activity tracker that dies within 6 months of use and charge people $100?  It's got a lot of cool features (the sleep monitoring is the best of the bunch), but no amount of features will overcome durability.  I don't care what it can do if it's broken and I can't use it.  I never even wore it in the shower even though they say you can.  I never submerged it.  I never twisted more than what I needed to put it on my wrist.<br /><br />There's nothing that turns me off from a product like a lack of durability with normal use.  If Jawbone doesn't do something to make me whole, they've lost a customer for life.  Maybe I'll come back when I hear overwhelming positive reviews about the durability and reliability of their products, but that won't happen for a while the way all the reviews of their new products are going.<br /><br />This sucks.  I really liked it when it worked...."
Perfect...fast delivery! Just as described... And exactly what I needed!
"The case is colorful but does not come with a strap. The hole is there but no strap for it. I was expecting it to have one. No biggie, just an FYI."
Burned my hand after wire split days later.<br /> Used a few times and had to toss
Love it...does exactly what it's supposed to do.
"No problems at first. Wish the rear camera had a better image, seems a little cheap, cannot see at night (added brighter lights to my truck for backing up). Front camera is great, good HD quality.  Worked for about 8 months, now it will not turn on. Tried to contact supplier with no luck."
"Water proof test worked. Case fit my phone perfectly. All features still function without difficulty (fingerprint ID, touch screen)."
Great product. Works well and we use it daily. So convenient.
Design peeled off 2 weeks after in use
for only $10 vat go wrong luv this
"Very high quality, suitable price. Thank you"
"This holster comes in three pieces, however the outer protective shell that protects the face of the phone is very hard to slide on. You literally have to force it on."
frayed immediately
It looks just like it I got the one with the blue glitter and pink hearts I accidntly drop my phone and it didn't brake it's actually protective or maybe I was just lucky but my phone is intact and so is the case
Was to big for my phone..was a waste.... 😾
Easy installation... Good fit.... Super quality...
"Awesome case, use it at the river and pool, verry good quality..."
"The team arrived in Venezuela with all its accessories, but does not start and unfortunately there is no way to fix it."
Good for inexpensive product. Rubber like material on sides bends easily and gets stuck in pockets.
Don't waste your money. Design peels off the first day of owning it.
I loved this case when I got it but it stopped taking a charge after 2 months of using it. I emailed the company to let them know in hopes that they would replace it and nobody ever got back to me.
"Probably fake. Make sure you aren't duped. Was going to purchase it, read the reviews and decided against it."
Great for a portable fish finder. Make sure you use the strap too tie off the excess cable. Mine got caught in the motor propeller. It only came loose one time. I used it on aluminum boats with up to 10 HP motors.
A great 2 in 1 cable this is one of the best I had. I love that I can use it for 2 charging electronics. Comes in a nice box for protection. It is attached good. The plastic cable feels great quality and I know it won't break easy.  I really like that it is reinforced on the ends of the cables where the plastic tends to break easy. Cable is soft but great quality. It is easy to interchange the head attachments. I have used it in my iPhone 6 plus and on my iPad and it works perfectly.  It also works to charge other items. I can also sync with no problem or issues popping up. Really good cable. Worth it various product uses. I recommend it. Great plastic quality.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest option.
not able to use
There was a piece broken off the side of the case.<br />I managed to glue it but there is a gap.<br />Not very happy.<br />The case would be fine if it was in one piece.<br />I already sent a response via packaging review.
For the price and quality this is the best but I have found for a glass screen protector! I will buy more and recommend this product. It also comes with cleaning wipes and tape to take the lint off before applying the screen protector
This is the drawer where I keep assorted lengths of wires. These cables are good quality and arrived quickly.
Use it every where! Keeps my phone charged
Great product for working and my morning runs. Awesome!!!!
the product is just awesome!
excellent
This case is fantastic!
This Battery Charger brought my phone back from the dead! It was delivered in a flash. Very happy with purchase
This is the most amazing phone case ! My husband works in contraction and has dropped this phone sooo many times and the phone just bounces protecting the phone it's the material of what the phone is made of its amazing! I really recommend give it a try!
"exactly as expected, good for travel and extended use of navigation"
The best freaking cell I have every had. No more touch screens for me
The phone is crap can't even turn on when you first set it up. Don't know why they still sell it
Great product
Good item. I am happy with it.
can't beat the price
Great case for my iphone 6 plus.
Really cute case and nice protection for my phone.
OK
"It works for my iPhone, iPad, and my android tablets. It's quite big and heavy (see the seller's picture - comparison to the iPhone), I was planning to carry it in my purse, but decide that it will be a bit too heavy). Mine cannot be charged to a 100%, 99% is the maximum that I can charge, although I did try to charge it before I even use it. The on/off button never works, so what's the point of having an on/off button? It comes with several adapter."
Loving my new selfie stick! It's very handy to use. It's connected to your phone and it's easy to use!
This is a very light weight retractable Micro charger cord. I love the retractable cord I tem because we usually have cords going EVERYWHERE in our van. This makes it a lot easier to keep cords from tangling. Cable length is approximately 90 cm or 2.9 ft. I really like it has a usb port because that means I can charge my phone and so can my husband without fighting over who's phone will charge first.<br /><br /> I received this product at a discount price in exchanged for my honest and unbiased review.
I was wondering if 3knights sold just the holsters to this case I broke the holsrwr
Excellent
Nicely made.  Doesn't topple over easily.
It works great.
Great phone at a great price.
"Gook phone, looks beautiful, worth the price."
works well.
"Works perfectly, original Samsung product."
"I just figured out that this is rechargeable!  I used my Kindle cord and it worked. I also noted that it is important to turn it off when finished, as that drains the battery."
I'd's everything I wanted - not sure how to store the pen. I get a lot of comment on it. One friend went online as I showed it off an bought one. Nice quality.
"Worth every penny...Not two days after purchase, I dropped my phone out of the car door getting out to go to the grocery store. The durable rubber made the phone bounce lightly and protected it completely-not even a scratch!"
although copied well tech content was poor; sound and transmission ranked between static and broken morse code. Poor Motorola model
Very nice built quality. Have it by my bedside now.
Awesome... very cool looking and sleek.. gets the job DONE!. .. a little heavy but that was expected.. will Def buy again if I need another
Very good!
Wonderful
"Is pretty, but it open real easy,I recommended to use a wallet and not to hang it over the shoulder has a purse.I hardly use it. not worth the money."
Neither of the two adapters works. Totally disappointed.
"Working great with my iPad Air 2. No issues, charges quickly and does not give any errors. Will purchase more in the future, definitely work every penny."
"Terrible. Not the item I ordered at all. The borders I received are white. The Ravens logo and lettering are blurry, and at the bottom there is text that says: 16- Month Plan Ner<br />Septersber 2014-December 2015.<br />I am high disappointed and want my money back."
This cover meets my needs and price range. It arrived well packaged and in good shape.
Very good protector !! And seller !!
"This product worked very well from May until August.  I used this product Thursday, August 27, working normally.  I charged it at night, but when I tried to use it Friday morning, they did not work.  I assumed I did not charge it long enough, so I tried charging them again.  Much to my dismay, they are completely unresponsive.  When I plug it in to charge it, the light turns on, but when you disconnect it and turn it on, nothing.  I think I would have been better off just spending more money on a brand name that will work longer."
"This screen is amazing!  Not only does it keep your screen safe but one of the best things I like about it is that it's oil resistant. I used to be a huge pain always needing to clean my phone's screen but since I've had this screen, it never gets dirty or oily! This is way better than the cheap plastic screen protectors or the ones that come with protective phone cases."
"van for holder window, thank you<br />Horace"
"Great Product for a reasonable price. It does take some time to charge, however, it holds a decent amount of charging power!"
"It was wrong cases, I ordered white and black but I got black and pink ,now I can't use it."
I got this product and the instructions that go with it are not clear.  The pictures are too small and the instructions are written for someone who already knows how to repair iphones.  I was unable to install the new screen.  I had to take it to a mall kiosk where they told me that the screen provided in this kit is not an actual iphone screen and is more of a replica.  I am not sure if that is true.  I don't recommend this product for the price.
"Outstanding product! As with any screen protector that has adhesive to adhere to the screen, placing it on the screen can be a bit of a challenge. However if you do it properly the result is a great screen protector...one of the best."
"Great wireless charger, but I wish it would charge my phone faster!"
"Very cute, fits phone great and got it day early :)"
Great
works great
"Cheap plastics - feels cheap. Scratches easily. Glad this was cheap, it landed in the trash and not on my iPhone. My old Griffin case, is way better - even after 2 years of heavy use."
It did not play. Sent it back and bought a different kind
"Perfect, thank you."
Love the case! Quick shipping.
"Cables arrived right on time and they work perfect, will certainly be a repeat customer.<br /><br />Thanks Greg"
waterproof
"Great battery.  The unit charges 4 usb items at once.  It's been great to keep both my phones, Ipod, and any other device I need to top off charged while in airports or on planes, or in business meetings where power is unavailable.<br /><br />Great customer service.  15 months into use, the unit still held a charge, however it would not output power to my devices.  Emailed Anker with the issue, and they are sending a replacement free of charge.  Thanks Anker!"
My ear lobes are very small and sensitive.  I found these headphones to be very comfortable and lightweight.  The volume control buttons are easily accessible and I like that they are raised which makes it simple to adjust.  You'll hear a message stating that youve  reached the maximum volume.  Thia gives you a powerful punch of sound.  Making calls and receiving calls is very simple and the sound quality is amazing.  I like the behind the head strap as it can easily be hidden under my hair.  Getting a full charge took less than 30 minutes.  The earhooks can easily be taken off and put back on as needed.  The little pouch that is included is an added bonus for storing tour headphones.  Received free for my honest review.
"I bought this phone from &#34;232Tech&#34;, they get 5 stars because the order was completed successfully and delivery was sooner than expected<br /><br />So far, the product meets the expectation... a simple Blackberry to keep Grandma in touch via Skype and WhatsApp."
ITS THE WRONG SIZE. IT DOES NOT FIT Huawei Ascend II
Really nice & comes up around sides to protect front if phone is dropped.
"Amazing came earlier than expected, it was exactly as explained"
My Samsung S4 fits nicely and delivery timing was good.
"This really is a great product. I thought the base was a little bulky when I first got it, but after &#34;installing&#34; it, I find I barely notice it's presence. It clips into the CD slot nice and securely, and maintains a secure grip on the phone (iPhone 6). The arm is firm enough that the phone doesn't move around and change it's position, even on bumpy roads, but I never find myself fighting and fumbling to find the right position. One-handed operation may take a little bit of technique, but is rather simple when placing and positioning; taking it out is easier with two hands, but still manageable with one.<br /><br />The main thing to keep in mind is the location of your CD slot, and whether your phone will cover up any other controls or displays. I'm using this in a 2006 F150 with a center console and a factory six-disc changer (that has never seen a single disc). As long as I place the grip at the bottom of the phone, I can still clearly see my radio display and access all buttons."
"It arrived in a nice timely manner and is in good shape but the Wall charger didn't work, and the battery must be the original. The battery lasts half a day with little use. The product is refurbished so everything should work as new, just with some scratches right? The battery is the most important part of the phone. By the time I get a new charger and battery I should have just paid the extra $50 and got a new phone."
EXCELENTE
great item
it works awesome
I had no problems putting the screen protector on my phone.  I like the durability of the tempered glass.
"Great price nice case fast shipping, I'm happy with my case."
"This gadget performs as expected, without a lot of unnecessary frills.  On a recent trip to Cleveland, we put it to a good test by allowing it to guide us from our hotel to the sites we wanted to visit.  Samantha generally knew what she was doing.  There were two occasions on our trip when the shortest route wasn’t the fastest; fortunately we had a paper map along as backup. “Trust, but verify,” was my wife’s verdict on Samantha.  I particularly like the feature that shows one’s elevation above sea level."
Love the feel.  Strong and great fit.
The Airave Version 2 Sprint Access Point was the correct item to solve the weak signal I was receiving on my Virgin mobile phone.  The item<br />was delivered on time worked perfectly.
"I bought this over a year ago, still works great.  Hope this was a bit more compact, then even easier to carry during traveling."
Great product for a great price.
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
Great deal and fast shipping. Phone was indeed in near perfect condition as described. erything works great. Was able to easily use with straight talk service provider. Totally happy with this purchase. Would recommend seller highly!
Item as specified.
works well for me
Works very well but think twice about ordering as it only has two USB ports. Love that the prongs are retractable.
"Just as described, no defects whatsoever! Will buy from you again!"
Very useful and easy to use. Puts the phone where it should be and easily adjustable
Still using it awesome
Did not properly fit the phone. Will be returning the item.
Great
"works well, unfortunately my ears are too small for it, but it does work."
Didn't work. I doubt it's compatible with apple products at all.
Perfect addition to our bike rides.
Great quality!
Thought it was going to have a pocket but it doesn't but it works well
"Excellent case, excellent service!"
"This, like everything else I have tried from Anker, works exactly as advertised!"
Product is exactly what I wanted!!
Thought it would be more 'rubbery'
"Great cover, even better price."
Fits the Galaxy S5 phone perfectly and is beautiful.
"Although I ordered the wrong phone (this is GSM but I found out later that I really I needed CDMA 450 MHz)<br />but nevertheless, I love the phone. The volume is enhanced, so that if you are hard of hearing this perfect. I gave it away to a friend who lives in a rural town in Yucatan, Mexico, actually it is for his elderly mom, who finds in hard to operate a small handheld cell phone. This is a fixed wireless desk phone that works great with a SIM card from the Mexican cell phone company TELCEL."
Wife loves it.  Works great!
"Charges quickly, fits well in the lighter socket.  Like the little blue light that reminds me it's plugged in.  This is my second AmazonBasics charger (lost the first one) and I've been happy with both."
Worked great
"I Bought the previous version of this product but don't see a difference between the two. Works great with Cricket, but there is a caution.<br /><br />It includes a nanoSIM, with adapters for microSIM and miniSIM. I didn't know the difference, but the phone I got had an icon on the box that said not to use adapters. I googled and found out that the problem isn't electrical, it is mechanical in that the contacts that connect to the SIM card can catch on the plastic seams of the adapter if the SIM is removed and bend or break.<br /><br />This problem isn't a concern for me since I have no intention of ever removing the SIM, but it could become an issue if I change carriers (or Cricket requires a SIM change for some reason).<br /><br />So, depending on your phone, and if you ever want to remove the SIM, this may be a problem. You can google how to remove a nanoSIM in an adapter safely, which essentially is to use a thin plastic sheet (like screen protector film) to slip in between the SIM and contacts before removing the adapter in order to protect the contacts. There are YouTube videos showing the method (example:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv8fA8j_8oQ)."
"This is an incredibly handy device. As a teenager that goes on many school trips, It's amazing to pass around the Audio cord and have the driver pop up anybody's music on the radio. Or if you simply don't have an AUX in on your car radio, this is your next best option!"
Worth
It works as advertising.
Excellent
This is a great head unit. Doesn't react well to fists.
"Case provides excellent coverage with access to all ports. Grip ridges on the sides give a firm feel when holding since the phone can be slippery without it. Not too thin or thick, fits in & out of a belt holster case with ease! Folsom is a trusted brand, can't beat the quality especially for the price! Color is richer lime green in person which is a plus!"
"CONS:<br />The reason I love HTC is for the camera.  This cover does not protect the camera, and camera started getting scratched in my purse in the odd times I used the Dot View.  I love SPECK cases and the quality of this cover is nothing like SPECK"
It's good.
Does not work with iphone 4 OS7 or mac )S 10.8 .
I returned this product because the case showed signs of wear after only a few weeks. The color began to wear on the corners.
Stopped charging after only one month.  Very disappointed
"ONE YEAR UPDATE:  Noticed that my phone was wobbling so I inspected & found that the ring that tightens to the swivel ball was completely split on one side.  Good thing I checked or I would've lost my phone on the highway!  Unit has not been abused or over-stressed, and is stored inside on my bike.  Don't waste your money on this -- especially if you value your phone or GPS!  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Securely holds my Samsung S4, or my daughter's S5.  Clamp fits fine on the slimmer sections of my handlebars, but not big enough for the thicker center section.  Because I had to mount it on the slimmer angled portion of the handlebars, there's not enough articulation to hold the phone directly facing me.  Even so, the screen is easily visible while riding, just on an angle.  I would buy this again."
it charges fast
Beautiful case
"Item came with no instructions within box. Item is as described, great sound and over all satisfied with purchase."
Fits perfectly and easy to install.
"Shipping took a while but it works great! The one thing is that it can't hold your phone vertically, so if you want to do that you have to twist its little octopus legs a lot and have your horizontally-clipped phone held sideways... doesn't work great but it'll do in a pinch. For most of my horizontal-phone recordings (widescreen style), works great!"
"Works well, small size and 2 x 2.4A ports to charge your devices at high speed. i received this product for free to test it and so far im loving it."
Absolutely amazing. I can charge my Samsung Galaxy S6 edge 10 times with this easy. I have also used it to charge my tablet (Nexus 9). It charges two devices at once easily. My fiancee and I use this when we are out and about during the day and have no access to charge.
This case did not look like the item online but much to my surprise it was actually nicer and of great quality. Not sure if it was redesigned and pic was not updated but I'm happy with what i got. Thanks
Pretty awesome. Holds phone very well and you don't have that band across the front face.
water got into the case.
Excellent product!  Fast delivery!
Works as advertised.  Uset the tools to remove a dash panel in an expedition.
"Very, Very Happy. Arrived on Time. Nothing bad to said."
Took a little while to get used to the new clasp coming from an up24 but overall I really like it. Tracking has improved.
My husband uses this almost daily. Loves it.
Great!
Disappointing. Brand new they last maybe eight hours. Admittedly i am on the phone a lot but the Samsung batteries lasted at least 24 hours when new. Ya get what you pay for.
Not a realistic wallet substitute
Yes it did
Awesome product thank you
Worked perfectly on my iPhone 5s
Neat little item. Very pleased
EXCELENTE
very good
Terrific!
DID NOT WORK
Works great! So glad I replaced my old one.
"Very slim, preserves iPhone 6 design. Texture has just the right amount of grip - it doesn't slip but you don't have a struggle pulling it out of your pocket either.  Altogether very nice"
Great and durable case. Super cute on my silver/white iPhone 6+ to boot. 😊
"After looking at all of the 'actual' Samsung branded batteries and their inconsistent reviews, I decided to go with a company that puts their own name (and therefore, reputation) on the product.  I'm glad I did!  The turnaround in my battery performance was immediate and distinctive.  I cannot recommend this solution enough for anyone looking to replace their phone battery."
Horible!
Its good
"Its a case, it works and protects - my kid has not broken his phone in spite of dropping it"
"Update - Sept 10  I have performed additional testing and I found out that the issue is not the battery, is the upgrade to the new Android Lollipop release that I installed in my cell phone some weeks before buying the Anker Battery.  The result of the tests in summary is that the Anker battery lasts at least 3 hours more than the original battery.    I have read some forums and I have implemented several of their recommendations to improve the battery life.  By the way I am very pleased with Anker support, as soon as they read my previous post, they contacted me apologizing and offering to replace the product.  I want to apologize for placing a bad review before comparing the Anker battery with the original one.  =============================================================================================== [Old Review] Battery doesn't last.  It even lasts less than the original one that i replaced."
I just received my Kate Spade phone case and I love it! It looks exactly like the one in the picture and it is beautiful and looks and fits real nice on my phone! Very pleased!
As expected
Exactly what I wanted.
"iLLumishield for the Nokia 1520 is easy, easy, easy to put on. The first time ever that I've done the dry method without messing it up. It's beautifully clear and the surface is SO super smooth to the touch. I like this much better than Armorsuit that I had on my Lumia before it.<br /><br />The edges do not seal down completely due to the curve of the glass on my Lumia 1520, but with the protective cover on it hasn't been issue to deal with either.<br /><br />I thought I had something great before, but Illumishield is much better. So much better."
"I was originally looking for a way to reduce alternator noise. After reading online info, seemed the best thing to do was find a way to take my high level speaker inputs that were run directly into the high level amp inputs from oe system and make them low level inputs for lower distortion. This unit not only turned my 4 channel speaker outputs into 6 channels. it combined it all into full range for the ft and rear and low for sub channel. It has adjustable bass levels and ... no alt whine.<br />Id give it 5 stars but I'm picky and it would be much nicer to have a separate max light for all 3 outputs, not just 1. Takes a little fiddling to get it right. but all and all very nice addition to the system. very happy."
Very comfortable to use while at the gym.
Excellent bluetooth transciever. Beautifull sound with my headphones.
Nice flip case for Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 Fits perfectly the phone is really protected with this case on with the S View Window makes looking at time and quick messages with a breeze every port is easily accessible
I'm a huge harry potter fan so when I saw this case I had to have it. I've had zero issues with this case. I love it!
The bracket is not good.
i really like this case it fits very well and it has a cute and cool design to this case its a very soft silicone thats very protective.
Exactly as described. Holds my iPhone 5s in a case and makes driving much safier and easier
"Easy installation, my recommendation is to clean the screen, gently place the protector on the screen and carefully move it into position, then when the position is satisfactory press the center to set the adhesive.<br /><br />The clarity is great, and the protector feels nice too. No issues yet, but with screen protectors issues usually don't appear for the first couple of months"
"Every now and then I let my son help me test products. This was definitely a fun one! I hooked my phone 6 to this selfie stick within a few seconds. You rest your phone on the bottom part of the cell phone holder and pull the top part up using the tap. Once my cell phone fell into the holder I let the tab rest against my phone. Plug it in and you're all ready to go. After letting my almost 2 year old run around with this selfie stick for half an hour, I can promise you two things: your phone does not fall out and this selfie stick is durable as all get out! Another cool feature I found was you can take videos by pushing the button once to begin filming and a second time to turn it off. This really is great for parties and the photos are HILARIOUSLY from a toddlers point of view. I received this selfie stick at a discount in exchange for my honest review."
"Love it!! Exactly what it looks like! Beautiful case. It's easy to close. You wont be disappointed! The only downfall is, the shipping took awhile, BUT well worth it :)"
The part where IDs was okay but there was no room for money how to put a small change purse in there very tight not what I expected.
"Ok, yes, it's cheap in price. What it isn't though, is cheap in quality. I read the reviews of this mount and several others before deciding to trust a reviewer who said he used this in his jeep off-roading. It does exactly as it says. It holds onto that phone and doesn't move or drop it. There are wheels for adjusting the angle and grip. You can use the sticky adhesive or you can use the suction cup. I use the suction cup and it's never moved from my dash. Granted I don't drive off road but I feel it would still hold onto my iPhone. I don't think it can fit an iPhone 6 Plus in a thick case but then again I didn't try that."
"I like the watch strap and ordered it in black. I wish the strap itself were a bit thicker. I have the watchsport space gray and bought separately the pieces to change the color to space gray where it hooks to the watch. However, the buckle for the watch is still bright steel, which I wish was also darker."
This is the best cases ever
The case is very good.<br />However it is clunky and makes the phone much heavier.
works good with my phone
After use for a while I don't know if by iPhone Battery get drain faster. But happy to use it. Will use it to test for a while
Works really well. I have my Samsung S6 in a otterbox defender case and it charges with no problem.
"Bought this phone for my 17 year old daughter and she loves it so then I purchased one for me. I love the size, still getting used to it. I had a Nexus 4 before this, which my husband is now using which is a move up for him. Seems like a tiny lag when swiping the screen up while on Facebook but that may be because the screen protector is on it and I am not touching close enough. I love the phone but make sure you purchase the sd card so you have plenty of space for all the apps."
Wow! What a power house! It doesn't take me long to charge my iPhone/pad now. So glad I decided to purchase it.
"I opened up a support case with Plantronics asking for a battery replacement. Well the warranty life is only 1 year, so basically, throw it out or buy a new one is the official answer. The battery will start dying down after a while. This was my second unit. I would recommend looking at other products.I don't think anyone wants to buy a headset brand that need a new replacement every years!"
"Bit bigger than expected but damn does it hold a charge. I gave it to my sister before she took a trip to Dubai, she only stayed there for 4 days but swears she only used the bank for charging her iphone 6 and never plugged it to an AC charger. She came back with 2 out of 4 battery bars left. Wow."
Good alternative to LG tone pro
Well worth the money and easy to use!!
I really like the feel of this case it's not very bulky but it feels substantial and high end.<br /><br />The wings are very unusual but cool. Until they broke and then the whole thing was extremely annoying. Its like the magnet wasn't strong enough to hold them to the case.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy this case.<br /><br />Product provided for review purposes
great case just don't care for the screen protector. its not easy to put on and u have to make sure to get it flat on or there are bubbles in between.
"Arrived & packaged as expected.  A co-worker suggested I check out OtterBox, and it is a good product.  I'm satisfied."
Nice case and as advertised.  Rated four stars as one of my cables with a thicker end won't work on this case even though it worked on a different case which has since worn out.  Otherwise I'd rate five stars as this is a very nice product for the money.
Works great for streaming
this was exactly what i was looking for to upload my music to my computer and you can also use it as a walkman like the old days
"This phone case is really handy.  It's perfect for carrying your phone, debit/credit card, driver's license, and money without having to take your whole purse.  It has a small hole in the top corner that you can attach the wrist loop to.  It works just fine without it too.  It fits the iPhone 6 Plus perfectly.  The phone isn't loose and all the holes line up well.  The card slots hold my cards securely too.  The case closes over the phone and has a magnetic strap to keep it closed.  This case is great for anyone on the go.<br /><br />I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review."
this was awesome!!!!! Will get another when I need one.  Well worth it.
"The screen i ordered didnt come with adhesive, so i ordered this adhesive which came quickly and worked perfectly.  The included tweezers are excellent and youll have enough leftover to do many other future devices."
Just as expected
"the the diamond look (bling) part that traces around the case,came off on day 2. the 2 pieces of stone that is on the closure came off as well. it was not worth the money. if I should you all a picture of this case and I haven't had it a month you wouldn't believe how quickly it fell apart..very disappointed"
"This is the best case!!  It beats the otterbox case that I had, by far.  Very happy with product and delivery!!"
crystal clear.  much better than the flimsy peel off protectors.
"I like the feel, the protection and how it swivels."
"*I received this product for free solely for the purpose of testing and reviewing this product. All unbiased opinions are my own.<br /><br />With this case, I now have convenience, and great protection all in one case. The wallet comes handy to store a credit card, while keeping the case thin. The only downside is, it holds only one card, and that may be a problem for some people. It also does not hold cash, which is another downside.<br /><br />The case itself is really tough. It is only made with 2 pieces, a hard outside and a softer inside, which are stuck together and make the case extremely shockproof. Pressing the buttons require a little more work, but not an extreme amount of pressure. The only thing that irritates me is that the volume on/off switch is recessed in the case, so you have to stick your finger all the way inside to access the switch. Good luck if you have grown fingers and little nails.<br /><br />Overall, I only took off a star for all the disadvantages, but I feel that the main points have been said in helping you find your next case for your iPhone 6 Plus."
"Fast shipping, great product."
"I bought one of these for my wife and one for myself back in May and I must say it has not been a good experience.  Our biggest gripe is that the Moto E is EXTREMELY slow.  It is hard to tell what the bottleneck is, but any level of multi-tasking will bring this phone to an absolute crawl.  I typically use Endomondo to track my walking and running while also listening to music stored on my phone with Google Music or streamed with Pandora.  So far I have not yet been able to run both apps without one or both crashing or the phone spontaneously rebooting.  If the phone is updating any of its apps, you might as well sit it down and walk away for a while because it will be mostly unresponsive until the updates are complete.  Switching between apps takes far longer than I would expect from any phone in 2015.  I have tried clearing cache and doing factory resets on both phones several times since we got them but have not seen any improvement in responsiveness.<br /><br />Another extremely annoying issue is that apps moved to the SD card are moved back to the internal storage when they are updated through Google Play.  So, if you plan on moving apps to the SD card in order to save space on the meager internal storage, be prepared to move your apps from internal to SD each time they update.<br /><br />The Moto E isn't all bad though.  The battery life is very good, there is virtually no bloatware and the built quality is very sturdy for a budget phone.  Motorola is also doing a great job keeping their devices on the latest stable version of Android.  I wish I could recommend the latest release of the Moto G over the Moto E, but it has the same CPU and memory bandwidth as the Moto E so I'm concerned that it might be a terrible multi-tasker as well.  I replaced our Moto Es with the Asus Zenfone 2 (purchased here on Amazon for $200) and found it to be a much better performer and better value overall than the Moto E.  Not a surprise really since the Zenfone's CPU is much fasterand it uses much faster RAM."
"Not giving it 5 stars yet because I've only had it for a day.  However, as far as I can tell this case is great fits very well. All buttons and cut outs match the phone. I am able to charge the phone with the case on with no issues. Each corner of case has a slight ridge that prevents camera lens to touch surface. Great product so far."
"So far, so good. So many apple chargers I have purchased (including the ones directly from apple) either don't work, or burn out in a few days. This one has been good so far and for the price I don't care if I have to replace it."
Nice screen protector.
"Looks stylish, does the job, sits anywhere, and does not fall off easily (coz it sits!). It also has a sticky pad to its bottom, which adds to the stability of this phone mount. Love it.<br /><br />Bought similar product in different design before (alike almost all products out there), which relies on a suction pad on one end to STAND itself, and hold phone on the other end like an arm. This creates a lever and makes it too easy to un-mount itself from wherever it should stand. Also I'm not a big fan of magnetic mounts for 1. I don't want to have to add something to my phone in order to mount it, and 2. I don't feel safe to put electronic products next to magnets.<br /><br />Drawbacks: 1. This thing would sometimes hold down buttons on the side of my phone, in my case the volume down button, so it would silence my phone. This can be simply avoided by moving the phone a bit. 2. This thing fits so well in the car with or without my phone mounted, in a way that I found quite often myself forgetting about taking the phone off with me when leaving the car. Why couldn't it remind me my phone's still in the car? Bad boy!<br /><br />All in all, highly recommend this phone mount."
This case is currently on my phone. It has been dropped many times and there is no cracks or scratches on my phone. I love how the blue part is rubber not plastic so it won't scratch my phone while putting it on unlike other cases. The pink part is hard which I love. I am very satisfied with this iphone case. 100%
Does the job very well...
used twice and wow its great and awesome only family wants me to charge there phone all the time but l told them to buy a huawei
Doesn't work with two LTE. Just buy one usimed iPhone...
Surface area on this magnet holds my Note 4 perfectly. I bought products like this in the past that couldnt hold my Note 4. I was happy to find that this one did.
"Works as intended, great product.  2012 WRX."
this case is truly beautiful. will recommend to other friends
"The wife picked it out and loves it!  So I'm happy. 'If the Queen is not happy, there is no peace in the kingdom.'  Very sturdy, protects the phone well, and looks great!"
Big discount for quick fair review ;) very happy.
"First, I will say if you are on the fence about ordering this case - order it. It is a great value for the money. Is it identical to the Lifeproof case? No. Is it a great alternative for a third of the price? Absolutely.  I installed this case 30 minutes ago, so if using it in the real world necessitates an update I will. Install was fairly simple. I did have to reinstall 3 times to achieve a &#34;clean&#34; install (with only one minuscule dust particle - I'm gonna go with it), but in my opinion that's not unusual for this type of case. One note - the ringer switch needs to slide into the toggle/switch on the case. If you look at the inside of the case before you slide your phone in this will make sense. I tested the case with three chargers. Both the authentic Apple cable and the Anker cable fit, but the Amazon Basics cable did not fit the port on this case. Touch ID seems to be responsive through the case. Although you can tell that you have a thicker screen protector between you and your touch screen (especially at the left and right edges close to the rail) the screen is still plenty responsive. No issues there. For headphones the adapter has metal threads and the case has plastic threads. I am concerned this may be an issue in the long term. The volume and power buttons are a little bit on the firm side, but still acceptable. I noticed that the material for the Touch ID protector ever so slightly &#34;overflowed&#34; onto the screen protector area and is visible with the case installed at the extreme bottom of the display. This is one of the minor build quality issues that I think are characteristic of this price point. Overall I feel the Merit case was worth the money.  EDIT: After a week with the case on my iPhone 6 Plus the volume buttons have become easier to operate with a softer press required. Although the material used to make the Touch ID sensor work is slightly visible one the bottom edge of the display I rarely notice it and if doesn't affect viewing of the display in any way. I have not subjected the phone to submersion in water, but it has been exposed to lots of windblown dust in the desert and as far as I can tell if has not penetrated the case or ports in any way. Prior to opening the charging port door I cleaned the case with a damp paper towel and it was good as new. After a week with the case I have upgraded my review for 4 to 5 stars. Great product Merit.  UPDATE: I have had the Merit case on my iPhone 6 Plus for approximately six weeks now. My only update is that the door/cover for the charging port clips or snaps in place. Over the last month and a half I have noted that on occasion when I remove the phone from my pocket  this door has popped open. This is only a minor inconvenience, but I can imagine that in a more hostile environment than my office this could subject the phone to sand or water. Also, this same door has now chipped on back of the door. I don't recall any substantial drops that would have caused this. A picture is attached. The chip does not seem to impede function, but is unsightly."
Nah
It was the  best.thanks
"In my understanding, I ordered screen protectors for an LG G2 - which is a 5.2 inch screen. But what arrived in mail was something else. These covers are for a LARGER screen. They're not even for the same phone. They don't fit on my screen at all. Greatly disappointed. I should have just gone to the store instead of ordering this online. Don't waste your money because the only thing they will be good for is filling up space on your shelf."
"My old battery would not keep a charge...at all...I ordered this one, my husband & I watched a video on how to replace it & my husband replaced the battery. Now my phone works great! It is a little complicated to change battery, lots of little parts...be sure to watch the videos!"
LOVE this phone wallet case!!  It holds just enough of what I need.  The phone fits securely and the Edge screen is clearly visable.  I like the fact the cards have a separate divider so when using my phone noone can see my cards.  I tend to carry too much and this wallet keeps me to the bare mimimun.  It will close only with a card in each slot and limited cash.  Love the plum color.  May order more!!
"I love this phone, It can work as a tracfone or be tied to verizon which I plan on doing soon.<br />perfect if you want the perks of a smart phone and the affordability. I have an iphone 6 I use as an ipod now, those things are way too expensive for plans."
Battery arrived dead. I charged it but would not hols a charge. Seller was easy to accommodate the refund but I should not have had to pay for the return shipping since the product was obviously defective.
Very cute..
"I requested a red and black case, I  received an orange and black case instead.Not happy. The case itself is fine.it would have received a better rating,"
Doesn't come with any instructions. So you don't know when it's charged or not.
Doesn't work well with my IPAD?
I love it 💜 great case with a great clear image fits snug on my phone.what u see is what u get
"A good product for the price, in fact quite good."
I got this case for my grandmas phone and she really liked it!
Good case to use when i do not use my other more creative ones
"I wish it were leather.  The plastic stretches so credit cards fall out.  Leather would not do that.  Otherwise, it looks good."
"Sounds great, easy to use but the remote hardly works! I also have the MW1 and it only work about 40% of the time. Extremely frustrating!!!"
none
very good
Nice case .. Arrived way before it was suppose to which was good 😊
great stuff
Doesn't go on very easily and it leaves a lot of smudges that you can't clean off
Did the job!
Works Great!
This is the best iPhone case I've had and the TARDIS design is perfection!
Very handy charger. Note Edge eats up batteries. I need at least two full charges to make it through busy day. This charger always allows me to have a charged battery handy or quickly charge a backup. Works off 12V too!
muy bien
I love the protection this case gives. I've dropped my phone several times while using this case and it has protected it from any damage. It goes on easy and I love the way it feels in my hand. It does add a little bulk to the phone but I actually like that it feels bigger. I've gotten many compliments on how great it looks. I would definitely recommend this case.
i expected this to last longer but while functionality is still good... Product is definitely not any better than cheaper alternatives
"Great battery case, love the removable colored frames. Would be nice if they offered more colors separately though!"
ive had this for a long time now and its such good quality :). i recomend
Doesn't connect instantly. Takes several minutes to connect to iPhone and be able to listen to music. I went back to aux cord.
First let me start by saying YOU CAN JUST REPLACE THE GLASS !! Now with that being said. If you have the time and the patients it can be done Please take your time removing the glass from the LCD. You will need a good hair dryer or a heat gun be very careful heating the glass to loosen the adhesive from the lcd. Also watch some YouTube videos and do your homework before attempting this repair. I actually removed the glass myself and then took the replacement part to a cell phone repair guy at my local flea market and paid him 20$ to install the glass for me. (Took him about 30 min) but that is a lot cheaper than the $100 to $200 that everyone else quoted me to do this repair. Also if you do attemp to install the new glass and digitizer be very careful not to break the digitizer!!!! It is very fragile  But if you do break the digitizer or cable. There is an app you can install on your phone to bypass these keys. So good luck and TAKE YOUR TIME !!!!!!!  Maybe something I said will be helpful This is my first review and the first time I've ever worked on a cell phone !!  Would have gave it 5 stars but no instructions  I also just purchased another kit to repair my phone  the first one was for my wife's
"The Anket is very handy, especially when traveling . It is very useful."
it did not look like wood at all like the photo it was a bad print as soon as i received it i had to put a sticker over it.
"These are very slick headphones with a lot of verbal feedback for what you are doing at any given time including telling you about caller information if you use them to answer calls, power levels, etc. The instructions are actually pretty poor so it's best that you get this sort of feedback to help you navigate their use more effectively. For the record, the &#34;pairing&#34;/&#34;power&#34; button is the little button in the center with a phone receiver on it. This isn't made clear in the instructions. However, the phone functions are clearly explained.<br /><br />The sound quality is actually very good, though it does vary based on how they are put in your ears. The manual makes it clear that fit affects sound. If you get a good seal, the sound is excellent with good bass and treble. If they're not in properly, the sound will come across as more muted, though certainly not poor by any stretch of the imagination. The high notes are especially rich. Bass was good and not muted, but it may depend on your sound source and type of music. I listened to U2 and it sounded quite good, though the songs weren't especially bassy.<br /><br />The headphones design is slick and elegant and whether or not you like it will depend on how they happen to fit your ears. My ears are average for a woman and they fit me fine. In fact, I liked the fact that they are smooth plastic better than a rubber/silicon ear bud design, but there is no adjustment possible. If they don't fit you, you're out of luck. I wondered if the lack of alternate buds related to the fact that they are waterproof or maybe it is to ensure that people put them in such that the sound quality is good. I would recommend putting the cable behind your head rather than having it hang down in front of you because there is less &#34;pull&#34; on the buds out of your ears. That being said, I tried them both ways and in front didn't cause me any issues even when I shook my head to see if they would fall out.<br /><br />I didn't add up all of the time that I played music through these without recharging and I didn't listen for more than 7 hours continuously, but it didn't seem that recharging was necessary at frequent intervals. I'm sure they'll last long enough for most needs based on my rough estimation. They also seemed to have some noise cancelling effects, likely based on the position they take in your ears.<br /><br />Note: I received a sample of this product in exchange for my assessment.I played music through these without recharging and I didn't listen for more than 7 hours continuously, but it didn't seem that recharging was necessary at frequent intervals.

Excellent case.<br /><br />Has survived many drops with no damage to the phone at all.<br /><br />Diztronic always has great products.
"Nice unit,  but I returned it and prefer the Mophie because it has a permanent on switch and a four level power meter."
Great quality and very bright wonderful colors. They are very high quality ink. I had no issues with it.
still using it and sound is awesome with the preamp
loveit
Love it
Junk  Freezer bag
It doesn't  protect you phone it cheap and unsafe could break easy don't by this piece of plastic
Fair price-works for around the neighborhood and they are loud and clear and keep their charge.
"Elegant, high quality, real leather. In summary: What you expect from a BlackBerry case. Really recommended.<br />Now on the other side (nothing to do with the product, but important to mention), I think this case is on the expensive side considering the value of the Cell phone itself. But worth it any penny."
"Disappointed with the microphone on these, but I was reaching thinking they'd work for wireless calls. The audio was decent until they recently fell apart only four months after purchase. The glue holding the ear buds to the rest of the ear assembly mushed out."
"It broke after one month of use. Very generic plastic. I thought the RCA brand would have been better quality, but it turns out this branding is inked on cheap plastic.  Very disappointed."
"Works great, love it!!"
WORKS GREAT
Using with Ram Tough Claw to mount GPS in RZR side x Side - working great and holds Nuvi very snuggly while riding rough trails and roads. This unit will definitely not come loose.
This is better than the cord that comes with the iPad 2 which eventually wore out.
good
"Slightly heavier than i thought it would be but that's ok. Haven't really used it much yet but i'll be taking it to work with me this week to try it out. Takes a while to fill to 100% which is understandable.<br /><br />I've finally used it and i've found that it loses power just as fast as the item charging!  My Note 4 has a 3220mAh battery and it seems that for every percent i gain on my phone, I lose it on the charger! Let's hope this is just a fluke."
Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you.
The first transmitter I received worked for about a month. A replacement transmitter was sent out right away and works perfectly.
Love em.... Will buy second one for back up....
👌👌👌
just enough sticky to keep it on the dashboard...  soft enough that when dropped I haven't broken anything.  I love it.
"I already have the other model that attaches to the dash board (or windshield) for my other car, and would recommend this one (but love them both). Less hassle, more convenient, doesn't fall off the windshield, holds in place very well. The strength of the magnet is very good. There is no way it would fall of while driving. You have to use a fair amount of force to take it off.  I guess the only con is that it restricts some of the air flow from the vent, ....but I can live with that."
Good price
The mic works great. Wish I had purchased it sooner.
Wasn't satisfied with the product
Great fit!
Excellent !!
"Nice sleek product nice fit , could have been better on bass - good for run/workout.overall worth the money spent"
I bought it for my new phone Moto G G3. It seems like a cheep case and the worst thing is that it doesn't fit to my phone perfectly in the bottom side. I don't recommend it.
Not worth the money. Buy otterbox!
Received them quickly and they work great with both my iphone6 and iPad Air 2 well worth the price
Good product charges great
Fit perfectly
OK. Good seller
Works as expected.  Have apple and non apple products so it's great.
Very little adjustment  broke very easy
Works very good !!
"I've never used a smartwatch before so when I got this, I wasn't really sure how useful it would be.  I have a Galaxy Note 4 in a wallet case, so it's a bit cumbersome to open and view notifications.  This watch has been super useful for just quickly checking whatever text or email I was just sent or who's calling without having to dig into my pockets and mess with my big phablet.  The coolest thing I've used with it so far is with navigation.  When Google Navigate is running, I can have an app on my pebble that will tell me what the next turn is, how far, and it vibrates when I'm getting close.  The only major downside I've come across so far is that the screen has tearing issues occasionally.  Lines will occasionally get scattered around across the screen randomly.  It's pretty easily fixed though by just navigating to a different menu and back again."
best thing evah!
"I really thought this screen protector was going to protect my screen. It seemed pretty thick and durable until the phone slipped from my shirt pocket as I bent over to sit (I am 5 feet tall, thus bent over the phone only fell from about half that) leaving the phone ( brand new) with two corners of cracked glass. Needless to say,  I'm not pleased."
Great case! I have had it on my phone for several months now and I have had no problems. It still looks the same as the day I bought it. Very cool and sleek design. The buttons are easy to press though they don't give that &#34;click&#34; as they do without the case. It has helped my phone survive many drops from chest height. I have had no problems with speech or sound being blocked by the case and no problems with accessories fitting such as headphones or chargers. I would recommend this case to anyone with this phone.
Love the sticker. Put it on my clip on case. Its peeling a little bit and I bought it in May (2015). Nothing a little Modge Podge cant fix.
"This worked very well in Serbia, Croatia, and Italy"
Great fit
It works as a waterproof case very well. The only problem I had with the case was the mute switch broke and the people were nice enough to send me a replacement case which didn't work either. But it's a good case. The people gave me a full refund. The only problem was the mute switch.
"This case was so easy to put on my cell phone, fits like a glove. I have only had this cell phone case for a month but, I would have no problems recommending this cell phone case to anyone."
The charger works just fine it got here on time so thank you for that So in till next time this order gets a five stars yaya awsome
Telling my friends how great this is.
"Very well made, fits my Galaxy 6 perfectly. It maintains the slim profile of this phone by adding very little bulk. I don't use it as a wallet, bu I can highly recommend it as a secure, attractive carrying case for the S6."
It was cheaply made
This is a great solar panel. It is thin and very light which makes it easy to put in a backpack without making it heavy and bulky. I was impressed that it could charge my smartphone and a 2000mah battery that I have. I will be getting another panel for some other solar projects that I have in mind.
"Beautiful concept, not at all practical though. The audio port is too narrow to fit any jack, considering drilling it out. The jigsaw like piece that fits the two halves together is flimsy in design and would be best glued together once you've committed to the case."
"It worked as advertised.  Plugged it in, turned on pairing and paired to phone, clicked the go button to find a station, tuned radio to station and hit play on Apple music.  This has solved a daily problem with 3 kids and 2 adults that had to rotate a very long AUX cable around the truck to play each other's music.  Another daily problem solved!!!"
"Very nice looking case, seems sturdy good for drops. A little bit hard to put on but that's not all bad, means it won't just fall apart if the phone is dropped or picked up by a 2yr old!! Fits perfectly and feels comfortable. Only bad thing is, the bittons like on/off or volume are a little hard to press. Which they fixed that and make it more like the otterbox. Overall there's nothing that would really deter me from buying another case. Possibly a white one.<br />Bad part....Shipping took a while,  i don't know if that's an amazon issue but ebay definitely has faster free shipping."
Doesn't look like the picture but I like it
Great product!  No problems. Don't buy anything else. This is all you need.
"Beautiful cover, and pleased with product."
Good price.
Absolutely a perfect phone for the price. Love it!
"No mesh earpiece, lines on the screen after professional install.  Tried 3 times to verify installation but the next screen installed without issue - this was just a bad screen.  Good price, unfortunate experience."
Works great
The wound quality for music is good. Has great bass. But phone wise my calls would breakup. Fully Charged only lasted half the day and most of the time it was on standby
Too small!!
Pros:<br />Received item quickly<br />Colors match pictures<br />Magnet seems strong<br />Phone fits perfectly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Smidge of blue color on the green flap (see pic)<br /><br />Other than that I'm happy!
"Previous versions are better. Look like Jawbone are not interesting to continue developing headset and they prefer go with the activity tracker, very disappointment"
works great good imaging like the downvue ferature
Loved this product!  Can take it anywhere and it folds down to a decent size!  #Selfies have never been so easy!
great
I have always been a big fan of Kenwood products. I purchased this amp to replace the same style because of issues with the circuit board. When the amp arrived it wasn't the one I ordered it was the 2000watt version. I'm not complaining just wish they would have told me so I could have done some research on it. I haven't noticed the 200 watt difference. With the hot days we have had I have been putting it to the test seeing if it will cut out as it's not fan cooled. It's been doing great I recommend this amp so far I will update if I have any issues.
Won't keep charge. Took a chance on generic and it backfired. Amazon prime purchase took 3 days to receive.
good
Great case. Very protective but not too bulky. IR blaster works great with this case too. I've dropped my phone a few times (on concrete too) and not a scratch to my phone.
not durable. soon you may need to buy new one. teared at the charge point.
Product arrived ahead of schedule and performs as anticipated.
"Get it, it works, iPhones 5s"
"Pros:  Great speed, great screen and Nokia apps.  Looks good.<br /><br />Cons: Slippery, seriously hard to hold on to.<br /><br />Waiting to see windows 10 later this year."
satisfied
great buy
Fast shipping .. Good item
Temper glass looks and feels great on my phone. Only issue I had with this was the procedure from not peeling off correctly. Other than that is great ď
Very good
"Bought mine about 18 months ago for about $90 on sale at Verizon.  Use it every day, not to power my iPhone 5S which is always charged with other chargers, but it gives one full charge to my iPad Mini.  It takes an overnight charge to get to four ****, but then fills up the iPad Mini beautifully.  Have recharged it countless times, still is reliable and compact.  There is newer and faster technology out there now, but I've been very satisfied with this powerstation duo..."
Sturdy and well made.  Great fun for parties.  A little difficult to turn the selfie stick off--you have to hold down the power button for a lot longer than you'd expect.  I wish the telescoping part was a bit longer.
"Good material, and protect my phone really good"
"Fit wonderfully, was easy to put on. Great price."
"This case is a piece of garbage.  My daughter received it for her birthday to &#34;protect&#34; her new iphone 6.  The second time she went in the pool with the phone and the case, the phone suffered water damage and was rendered useless.  Now we own a worthless $70 case for a $600 broken phone.  These cases are a complete sham."
Great product.  Exceptional quality.<br />Will order another 1
"Works with 2008 Chrysler Sebring.  Instructions were adequate, 2 harness options provided."
"Well this item that I purchased is not what I expected it to be. This phone does not charge at all,none what so ever. Really disappointed. Need an address to return please"
Good quality with cheap price. I always charge 4~5 phone & tablet but it shows me good performance every time.
Works great with my LGg4.
Lasted a week....
Worked ask advertised
"The Pebble Time becomes a brick two weeks after you start using it.  Pebble shipped these watches with a known defect in the charging system.  The watch will only charge one or two times, and then will stop charging altogether.  Pebble is being flooded with emails.  Support response is extremely backlogged.<br /><br />The watch does not stay charged &#34;up to 7 days&#34; as they claimed.  Three days, four tops.  Then it dies after the first or second time you charge it up.<br /><br />Pebble needs to do a recall.  Just google &#34;Pebble Time does not charge&#34;.  You will see even professional reviewers had to send for replacement cables while they were testing the Pebble.  Each reviewer though it was a one-off problem, but it isn't.  This is a serious defect affecting a large number of Pebble Times."
"This is useless. It hold your GPS upside down and just isn't practical. I gave up trying to use it, and wish I had bought the clip version instead."
not real good
Great quality. Fits perfectly.
Excellent case. The quality you would expect from Otterbox!
"This selfie stick is SO much more than a selfie stick. I was offered a free product in exchange for an honest review. Having used other selfie sticks before, I was expecting to rate this one lower. Why? I'd had MANY other experiences to compare this one to. Could it -really- be the BEST one I'd tried? Well, yes- it definitely could be. I am so impressed with this dang thing that it's not even funny. Can you hear the excitement in my voice? It's definitely there. Anyways- why is it a 5 star product?<br /><br />This is an all-in-one selfie stick. Essentially it's not only a selfie-stick, it's also a tripod. Let's discuss the selfie-stick aspect first. As with most selfie-sticks, you connect your phone (or this one can actually work with a GoPro camera as well) to the stick, and then you take a picture. This one has a bluetooth button that you can connect to your phone- then you press the button and it takes the picture. You can get all sorts of awesome angles holding the phone a ton of different positions. LOVE it! I just have so much fun with it.<br /><br />But, the real reason this selfie-stick sticks out from the rest is that it can also be used as a tripod. It has three feet on the end that can be spread out, and then the stick can be adjusted to different heights. Once again you can connect your phone or GoPro to the stand, and then use your bluetooth button to take a picture. This makes it PERFECT for taking large group selfies. You can literally stand the camera up at an appropriate height, run into the picture with your group, snap you clicker and take a photo! It's so unique in the fact that you no longer need a photographer behind the camera. You can take pictures at a distance and that's really awesome to me.<br /><br />I like that the tripod can be adjusted in height so you can take an array of different photos and make sure that everyone fits in (whether their shorter kiddos or taller adults). The tripod itself is a bit wobbly, but it gets the job done. The clicker works well, but loses it's connection at about 15 feet away (but seriously who's taking a picture that far away anyways?). Overall, and awesome product. I'm rating it five stars because it's so versatile, and I'm definitely a fan.he clicker works well, but loses it's connection at about 15 feet away (but seriously who's taking a picture that far away anyways?).

Work good.
"I could never get this thing to work.  I reached out to the company twice, requesting help to set it up and got no response.  I'm so disappointed."
Great case for the money. Hope it holds up over time. OB lasted less than 1 yr.
"Great product, got this for traveling when I need gps/waze in a rental car. Easy to put on and take off. Holds my phone very solid doesn't fly out and the whole piece stays on well. Would have given 5 stars but I can't get it to stick to dash board only the windshield ."
Good customer service lousy product. Died after two weeks and sound quality just awful. They promptly replaced unit but I'll probably just give them away. Wish I had spend more on better brand.
great gift for my daughter
"I don't usually write reviews, but this is really cute. I love the colors and the stylus was a nice surprise. Fast shipping and the price is really great."
Comes up as not compatible or not an approved adapter for this device. I am on IOS 8.4.2.
"I had been looking for a cheap phone to replace my Galaxy note in my work environment because I don't want to break it.<br /><br />I've tried 5 different phones: 2 Cubot, 1 Blu , 1 Irullu and the RCA M1. Well I can tell you that the previous ones had issues but the RCA works best.<br />Since starting using it my Note stayed in the drawer. The RCA does everything I want it to do and does it quite well... It has only 1 issue which I can live with. The WIFI sometimes looses signal and I have to fight to get it back (Part of this may be due to my router here).<br /><br />The camera is worthless at night or in low light but works OK in daylight. The video format is .3pg which many people can't view when sending a video via email. (workaround is to use a video converter before sending) .<br /><br />I would recommend this phone to anyone who want a disposable phone that works.<br />3G works fine on 850mhz but the phone does not support 3G on 900mhz. I use 2 different companies and one is on 850 the other on 900. Does not bother me because the 3G prices are the same for the both companies so I just use the 850 one.<br /><br />Actually I've bought 2 of them and would buy an other right away if I break one to always have a spare.<br /><br />I've used some heavy apps some are a bit slow but still do the job. Skype works but on the slow side."
Arrived in good time.  Works well.  No complaints.
"excelent product, this case is very nice"
Took one charge and that was it. Returning it now
Great product.
Works well.
GOOD
Nice
Great product and service.
Nothing more than a fantastic case.
I get loud humming and buzzing noise when my radio volume is up. Tried multiple stations and still getting the annoying sounds. Want to return.
It's good but I wish they sale  different parts separates
Nice phone for the money
My mother loved it and it came in a. Timely manner
It's absolutely beautiful and we'll made. I can't wait to use it.
"This thing is awesome. I really like it because I can display things on my T.V. without any software or wifi, etc. This works great for playing Netflix on my phone in Hotels.<br /><br />It is important to know however... for some reason, plugging your phone in and then going to the input doesn't register my phone. I thought it was broken or just not compatible at first. But, If you put your TV input on the HDMI first AND THEN plug in your phone, it comes right up. Don't know why, I just know that for my phone and TV it has to be done in this order."
"Works only one month, even worst than Apple OE."
"The LUVVITT® ULTRA ARMOR iPhone 6S Case iPhone 6 case is an awesome case. After having this case for several months, these are the things I have come to find:<br /><br />Fit - 10/10<br />My iPhone 6 fits snugly into the TPU core case. All of the buttons are aligned perfectly onto the case and are immediately accessible should you need to adjust the volume or lock your phone. The hard shell case, which is the outer portion of the case, adds some an additional layer of protection  and fits nicely over the TPU case.<br /><br />Protection - 10/10<br />I personally found the case to be very effective in protecting my phone against my careless/abusive behavior. I'm the type of guy who would throw the phone onto the table immediately after coming home from a long day of work. Not only has it withstood my abuse, but it has also proved its durability against numerous drops. My phone still remains in mint condition, without any scratches, dents, or cracks.<br /><br />Look - 9/10<br />I love the way it looks, and I think its awesome that they provide you multiple colors to choose from. The look is simple and sleek. Not much design on the product, so it might not be for people who like cutesy, flashy phone cases.<br /><br />Price - 11/10<br />For 10 bucks, this thing is easily worth the investment. I normally skimp out on buying any form of protection when it comes to phones, but with these costing an arm and a leg these days, i thought it would be wise to get some sort of case for my phone. I'm glad I went with this case.<br /><br />Overall, this case has proven to be worth the investment. It has kept my phone in pristine condition over the past 7 months and I couldnt be happier. For $10, its hard to beat!"
They are okay.  They need to be just a little bit longer.  Otherwise they are good.
"I've tried other kits and this is the best I've used so far.  The tools are nicer than other kits I've purchased and the screen image looks as good as the original.  If you are attempting to do a iphone screen replacement yourself, make sure you get one that has the digitizer like this one.  Do NOT get one that is only the glass replacement. The digitizer is GLUED to the glass and you will need a heat gun to soften the glue to get the broken glass and even with that it is difficult. Get the digitizer like this one.  Highly recommend - you can do it yourself. Just don't do it when you are in a rush; make sure you a few hours set aside."
"I bought this case for the novelty of the wooden material, but this thing just turned out horribly. It's bulky, it has bad grip, and it's very flimsy. The thing broke within two days of using it, after falling a measly 1.5 feet onto the floor, it shattered to pieces. What good is a case that can't even protect itself? Complete waste of money."
Just got this in the mail and it works great! I love the color too. A beautiful purple! The power is strong and charged my phone quickly. Love it!<br /><br />I got this product at a discounted rate in return for my HONEST and UNBIASED review.
"For what it is, I like it alot.  I have not dropped my phone yet (knock on wood) and it does not feel as secure in my hands as the rubber cover I had, but it is what it is and does feel like it can protect my phone."
"Great battery, great company"
"[[ASIN:B00ZC8X8EU [Smart AI Rapid Charging Technology] RoyPow 5V 5.2A 26W Dual-Port USB Car Charger Cigarette Charger for Apple iPhone iPad, iPod, Samsung Galaxy Google Nexus 7, Fire Phone, White]] I purchased this usb  car charger at a discount in exchange of an unbiased review. I got this item on time and the packaging is well made. I found this car charger very useful. I use it a few times now in my car. The two port devices are really functional. Perfect because we have two iphones on the go. It's the right time to change my old one since my old usb car charger are getting tired of me, i've been using it for a very long time. Once you plug them in, the blue light will come out it means its working and ready to use. The deal I got for this product is all worth once this product will last for a long time. but I have a good feeling."
Works great.
Love this car charger! My favorite part is that I can charge my phone while someone else who is in my car can as well. It also charges my iPhone 5c very quickly which I love in case of an emergency. Would buy another!
"The first thing I noticed about this charger is that it has a very solid feel to it. Being waterproof, it only has a couple seals to cover up the ports which means less parts that could potentially break."
loved that the case came with screen protector!
Did not like.
I love it
I loved the colors and designs.
This key board is a piece of garbage if you have a Mac.
I love the convenience of this product. The sticky tape that holds it on is very strong and secure. It's made from a nice stretchy material that is tight enough to hold just one card but does expand a good bit. I'm bad about forgetting to use it but I'm sure as time passes it will get easier to remember it's there. It doesn't add a lot of bulk at all to my phone case. I even use it occasionally to hold a mini bic lighter and it has yet to stretch out. Nice product!<br />* I received this for free for my honest review and I do recommend it!
Very good case but very heavy.
"Good product,  we have this near yhe table seems that is where everyone ends up hanging out.  Its worked great so far.  Love little plug with the cord.<br />We use several size usb cords to reach everyone from 3 ,6 ,and a 10 foot one for the person at the end of table.  Seems someone is always needing to charge and this way no one has to play musical chairs to get near a charger. We just keep extra cords put in a little box ypu don't have cords all over the place all the time<br /><br />Im ordering another to put in my bedroom for my 3 devices."
Great product
"Great case, for the price I love it. My son has dropped it several times and my phone has not gotten any scratches on it"
"It works perfect. Simple, fast charging works great with my s6 edge. The weight is less than the average of this charger size. And with a rapid charger, the choetec charges in less than 2 hours. Excellent. Recommended."
Best phone holder
Great
I was happy to receive it and it's working fine I'm happy
"This is the second of these cases I've ordered and it's perfect for my needs. The first one was for a Samsung Galaxy S3. I had it for 3 years and it performed just as I wanted. The phone and the new Note 5 that I just got, are very slippery and sometimes hard to pick up. I didn't want a bulky case. This case has grips on the edges that allow the Note to be picked up easily. The rest of the case keeps the phone from being so smooth and sliding off, or out of things, while protecting it. The first one I had, held up well, still flexible and didn't get all scratched up. I expect this one will as well. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it took a whole week to get it. I think I paid more than priority mail costs, for shipping and would have expected to get it a little sooner than I did. I was so afraid for the Note, until I got the case. Well worth the price.  Oh, and I love the color!"
Turned blue the second day
"Pros:I love that I can put two cards in the case and don't need to carry a wallet. The curve shape of the case makes it easier to carry my phone around. Easy access to ports and pronounced power and volume buttons. The back snaps on/off easily and securely. Great price.<br />Cons: The case is a little bulkier than most cases. The shiny back of the case shows every fingerprint smudge. The front edge of the case is flush with the phone, so I can't face it down. There is a longer ledge around the camera opening that may impede the effectiveness of the flash."
"Just got it and it fits my license, ATM card and AAA card.  It accomodates 5 cards but the back bumps out and difficult to slide open.  I wouldn't suggest more then 3 cards due to card embossing on them adding further thickness."
Lasted 2 months
"Very snug on phone which is perfect. There is no gapping which I have had issues with in the past. Very cute design. The stylus did have a small dent in it, however I think that was due to the postal service not being careful. Great purchase overall."
Color comes off
Great headphones.  So far the battery lasts a long time.  Sound is good for videos and music.
The tabs keep breaking on this and causing it to sag outward
After 2 months of use the case all front edges came out. The case now looks useless and ugly.
Works as expected.  I turn car on it turns on and connects to my phone without issue.  Mostly use it for streaming but call quality is very good as well.
Works great for adjusting the angle of my fish finder so that I can see it.
These cases are great. No they aren't durable BUT THEY WERENT MEANT TO BE. They are meant to be aesthetically pleasing. Besides its wood. It breaks when you drop it. It's a great if your in to cool different things.
I am very much impressed with the quality of this phone holder. It is a simple but very ingenious holder in my opinion. I did receive it free of charge to test it and share my honest opinion. Really easy to use you simple stick the holder in the vent of your a/c air in the car and if you have a plastic cover on your phone you put the round or larger metal plate they sent with it between the phone and the cover so the magenta will work.The holder is rubberized so it won't scratch your phone . I took a picture of the phone with the magnet inside my plastic cover to show how strong it is. I am very happy with this product and I do recommend it.
I bought these as Christmas gifts for my family last year.  We went on a family cruise last New Years and these worked awesome!  If you are wondering if you will be able to communicate between decks and across the huge ships you can!  I have not had a use since but next cruise they will be charged and packed.  Just plan on over a day to fully charge them at least the first few times.  Used them by the pools with out the worry of them getting wet too!
"Very good quality and a rich look,  I have had people comment on the nice look of it.  Very happy!"
"So far, I love it! Perfect for office settings. Very discreet. Smallest bluetooth that I have ever had. Battery life only runs about 3 hours of music play, but for this prices, it may be worth buying two to get through the day :)"
"I have used so many car-phone mounts that I should have 1 on every window in my car... I even use them in my house while cooking and even on the nightstand next to my bed. I like this one because it gives you the convenience of having your phone within eye shot without having to disrupt your view of the road. There are already way too many distractions to add one more just to hold your phone.<br /><br />It came with several different rubber pieces to use on the part that actually goes into your CD player, depending on the thickness of the CD opening. Though the instructions for this product didn't really make it clear what those pieces were for. There was only 1 place on the box that showed the different sizes. I do like this product and will continue to use it as I like the fact that it's not an additional distraction on the windshield but I wished the screen on my stock radio was in a different place. It only blocks a part of the display but I don;t think it will be like that in most vehicles.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this product!<br /><br />*I was given this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my honest opinion*"
My first selfie stick ever!! It does a good selfies!!!!
"These sounds great but have some serious UX and quality flaws. the inner lining of the earphones is only GLUED, not stitched... so it recently started to tear away from the foam padding. Really not ok. Has seriously affected the functionality.  :(  :("
Very cute case but it really doesn't fit the phone very well.  I have a hard time with the downward swipe because the case is positioned too far over the top of the phone.  Spend a little more money and get a better fitting case.
"I received the charger very fast, and am pleased with the contact the seller has made to ensure I'm happy with my order. They seem eager to please, but I doubt I'll have to contact them, because I'm happy with my charger.  I like that it is slightly illuminated, so I can easily find it in the dark.  Note:  I believe the port labelled &#34;iPad&#34; has more amps, which is necessary to charge an iPad, but you can also use it to speed charge your phone if you have a quality cable."
Love this Garmin band. It is super.
I use this stand daily
"Good deal for the money.  Offers some protection from impact, and makes the phone less likely to slip around and get damaged."
Its beautiful!!!!!<br />I love it...
So far so good. Fast shipping .
Power add makes the best products!  This is the third portable charger I have gotten from them and this one much like the others charges my Galaxy quickly. I am a Poweradd customer for life!
great
Perfect for charging your iPhone when you're out and about!
So much easier to hear on the iPhone using this. Nice find.
Good cover for the fish finder. Works as expected.
Item as specified.
strap came off but not before the magnet stopped working.<br />Another thing that will have to go in the trash and I'll have to replace it.
"I bought this as a replacement to an Incipio Case that didn't work out.  This case, on the other hand, has been fantastic.  It's hard, but not huge.  I love it, would recommend, and will buy again for a future iPhone."
Works great. Easily to do if u knw how to follow directions. I followed a YouTube video. Installed in less than 30 and works great.
"When I received my item in the mail I noticed that the plastic case packaging was cracked in 2 separate spots that went all the way through to the other side and the screen protector was bent, I applied it to my phone and have to constantly apply pressure to keep it flush with the phone."
"About the same quality as the cheap 50 star flags you get at Walmart, but since I'm only flying it around Independence Day it should hold up many years. It was only out for one week this year, but we did get a couple of thunderstorms and it survived with no fraying or fading. If your looking for something to leave outside for any length of time I'd look for something better, but if it's going to be indoors or only uses outside occasionally it should serve you well."
It's alright
My daughter is extremely satisfied with this case. Fits the iPod Touch 5 perfectly and provides a better grip. Colors are bold and match well with the original pink color of the unit.
I've purchased many screen protectors in the past and have always had trouble with installation. I had absolutely no problems with installation with this one. I followed the instructions and the screen protectors went on without a hitch on 2 phones. Great product!
Fit in iPod touch and iPad 2 but fail to charge either. Tried with 4 cables that all worked without adapter.
This is a VERY nice product that came in useful as soon as it  was charged. PERFECT for my needs at work and on the road. Beautiful design and feels &#34;good&#34; to hold as well. I would recommend this to anyone that needs a power boost for their devices that allows the device to charge and be used at the same time (at least with a phone anyway!).
"The case on amazon was the best price I could find and it came really quickly.  It came all intact and everything as stated.  Love how sleek it is.  I bought one for my iPhone 6 plus, this one is on my husband's iPhone 6."
Good
"The card sleeves are a little bit tight. Can't fit much more than ID, CC and one or two more cards, but the whole point of the purchase for me was to slim down my wallet, so I'm not complaining. The magnet that secures the iphone case to the wallet portion is really strong and reliable (after two weeks of use). Overall, great value, and I would recommend it."
Great product. Relatively easy to install and does look like glass.
"Came on time, the color is different from the picture tho, it looks whiter in person"
"This selfie stick is relatively easy to use. It's adjustable, so that's an added bonus and I like the box it came in. The packaging is gifty which is a huge plus for me."
A surprisingly good case at an excellent value price.
Very pleased with this extra battery for my LG G3 cell phone. Have no complaints. Would recommend it to anyone.
"I own a 2005 Equinox and it was one year shy of getting an aux-in. And 1 year too new to get a cassette player. So I have been stuck using FM transmitters. I have gone through several in the last ten years and they never worked very well. My car was great at picking up radio stations from mexico but it could never get a good signal from the fm transmitter. A few months ago I bought this and it has blown away all the other fm transmitters I have owned. The sound quality is great, I can hardly tell the difference between it and an aux in.<br />The good:<br />Sound quality is fantastic. Very clear strong signal far better than any other’s I have tried.<br />Bluetooth connects right to the phone once I get in the car and start it up.<br />Dial on the top makes tuning stations easy<br />No need for batteries, has a usb slot for powering device.<br /><br />The anti-good:<br />My car has the accessory-power jacks between the seats so that puts my fm transmitter in a bit of a hole. So for my car the neck isn’t long enough so a passenger is needed to manipulate it while driving. If you car has the jacks in a normal place, than you are fine.<br />No auto-scan. But that’s ok cause I haven't ever been impressed with those. The tuner on this works better.<br /><br />Update:<br />Recently it stopped working. Had a short or something. So I emailed the company and they sent me a new one no questions asked. Fantastic support!"
It is just as I expected
"Terrible. I am writing this review from an iPhone 4, since the video to do the replacement on my iPhone 6 was so vague. Don't attempt to do this yourself. Spend the extra money to have it done by someone who knows what they are doing."
Product feels like it is good quality. I hope to get a few years out of this. I feel confident about this product.
"Worked as promised. I had one go bad and the seller did a great job of replacing it, no questions asked. A nice change from $20 Apple cables."
this is a great device but for some reason it keeps disconnecting from my phone. the ear pieces are a bit uncomfortable but it might just needs to be broke in.
This is great and so easy to use!  I keep it permanently attached in my car.
It came earlier then expected. 😄😄 I love this case its my favorite.
"Great Case, better customer service!"
Update:  Since my last review Amazon replaced my unit And the new unit is working like an Anker should. Am updating the rating because of both Amazon as well as Anker's stellar customer support.<br /><br />Well guess its my luck this baby will not take a full charge. Left it overnight still only 3 LED will light up and charging a phone will drop it down to two ....feeling a bit let down specially with my upcoming trip ...
Brought this phone for my daughter she loves it works great compact and cute pink color.
Sounds pretty darn good. Could use a little more bass but for $20 it blows away everything else I've listened to
"Absolutely LOVE these.  Not only are they weight-sensitive on-off, they are great for an added boost to the height of the seat in winter to see better. LOVE 'em!"
This powerbank is awesome. Lasts several days/ number of charges for my phone.
Love this band and I've used several. Sturdy. Adjustable for various sizes. Yup! Win.
Bought this item for my son off of his Amazon Wish List and he was very happy with the product when he received it .
good
It works but I can never seem to get all the bubbles out no matter what I try. It's only a few. It works though. It's a great deal for the price.
nice and sparkly
I loved this cover. It arrived on time and it was exactly how it was described. I bought this so it could be a heavy duty cover because I have two toddlers and because I can put like money or a credit card without worrying it will fall. If you want it for other reason than don't get this one. I love it.
Was not appropriate for my needs
Locks securely into cup holder.  Very stable.  Does not allow my 10.1&#34; tablet to move on its own.
Does what it says it does! Not light on it but its no problem.. im happy with it.
It was great thank you
Love it. Amazing product.
best
This cord works as well as my apple cords do.
"This phone is awesome, ive had allot of phones but this one is by far the best ive ever had, i owned the nokia 1020 and K zoom cause the camera on a phone is the most important feature, i loved both of those phones but this one is far better, the video's this phone produces are beautiful, if you were to buy this phone just for being a camera you will be extremely pleased, also the specs are good enough to play any game the android market has available, also the body of this phone is very nice, removable back plate for swapping battery, and metal frame are awesome, only negatives with this phone are no memory card slot and no optical stabilization. If you wish to see the video quality for yourself click the link below for my youtube channel.<br /><br />https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnWW7mkP6ToWFeUo_VrsKTwCUN5b2Hxqc"
Great ear phones! Works well.
"Work better than expected with my S4, Tab 10.1 & MXII, (google TV box)."
"nice case. Fits great. So far I have not dropped it, but hopefully when/if I do it will protect my phone."
"After about 2 years, the battery life on my i5 was down to about 4 hours of typical use, so I figured I would get a new battery.  The highest rated battery with tool kit on Amazon would not ship to my location outside of the &#34;48&#34;, so I went with another seller's product.  The tools are fairly low quality and I broke one of the plastic pry tools during first use.  The other, smaller tool was able to get the job done (there are 4 different plastic pry tools in the kit; 2 guitar picks and 2 chisel-like tools).  The replacement of the battery was quite simple with the only challenge getting the separation of the screen from the back case a bit of a challenge (look up YT videos on the process and be slow, gentle, and patient).  The reason for 2 stars is due to the tools being &#34;functional&#34; for the task.<br /><br />If it weren't for the tools, this would be a 1-star review as the battery itself has proven to be essentially worthless.  It is identical to my original battery in all markings except one: It's old.  Very old.  the original battery in my phone has a manufacture date in 2013.  The &#34;new&#34; battery I received with this order has a manufacture date of 2012, so it has been sitting on a shelf for 3 years.  I've had the battery in the phone for several days now and run it through several charge/discharge cycles to be sure, but I can't get the &#34;new&#34; battery to run my phone for more than about 3 hours.  I'll be popping my phone back open and putting my original battery back in so I can get at least 4 hours and then looking for yet another battery source to see if I can find a newer battery that will function at near original capacity levels.  At least I have the tools now, so I can search for just the battery."
"Product seems to be working very well with both iPhones and our iPad.  Would definitely recommend.  Nice having the dual ports, which both work well at the same time, not slowing down charging."
it didn't work! :(
Very good. Love it!
"Well built and clearly well tested.  It fits snugly, and while I'm not planning on testing this out, looks like it would provide good protection against accidental drops. Another plus is that the case doesn't add much bulk to the phone.  I've owned cases in the past for older phones that near doubled the thickness of the phone itself.  This is a nice slim form factor, which is nice considering how large the Nexus 6 is to start with."
Very convenient. Im using it a lot
"Great sound for the money, fast delivery."
"Ugly fit...Bad fit, the phone wobbles inside...<br />OK glossy print at the back, but nothing special...<br />Waste of money and time!<br /><br />Was in the bin after just few minutes on.<br /><br />Will keep looking.<br />I would give it half a star if I can..."
"I wear it everyday and it really provides incentive to keep up the number of steps taken each day.  The sleep tracker is very interesting to analyze sleep patterns as well as give a little &#34;nudge&#34; to help you get your goal amount of sleep each night.  I do not use the food/calorie counting aspect as I find my diet too difficult to track due to erratic eating habits. The battery holds quite nicely for approximately two weeks.  This style is worn easily and without fear of losing it as happened to me with a new Fitbit that I had on for less than three hours - gone!  Unfortunately, however, I believe this style is being discontinued which, IMO, is a mistake on the part of Jawbone.  Get it while you can."
i like it!
My husband puts these on phones for a living he places this one against my phone Gently  and it shatters.. Poor quality for as much as you pay for it. NOT WOTH IT.
"JOTO's waterproof case does everything as described! It's a such relief not to have to worry about my iPhone 6+, just enjoy it! Used my JOTO on the water this weekend (I'm 73 & love kayaking). My JOTO is easy & simple to use (important when dexterity lessens!) and I got just as clear pictures as when it's not in the JOTO."
"Just receive, seems good."
Cute case however strap is not very sturdy
"I did not like it, it barely fit felt cheesy and it broke on me the next day"
The quality is not higth.
"From the moment I installed this product in my vehicle,  I fell in love! The Samsung Wireless Charging Vehicle Dock rocks! I have a Samsung Note 3 phone that has a wireless flip cover and I needed a Qi wireless charging dock for my car. The charger works every time I place my phone in the dock and I've had no problems at all.<br /><br />I love the fact that I can charge my phone easily and wirelessly. I also love the fact that the Qi Wireless Charger rapidly charges my phone. I've had others Qi wireless chargers that worked when they wanted to and charged very slowly.<br /><br />This is a high quality, very effective and nice looking product and I highly recommend it."
"i expected thick rubber that protected the pone and had a great feel. This feels slippery in hand. the colour looks great for me, but disappointed wit finish and feel."
it does what I needed it to do.
"I dont usualy write reviews but this thing is awesome works great holds charge for several charging cycles over several days which is great for me becuase I'm always mobile and I do everything via my phone. The 4 usb power ports great for multiple devices. It is alittle heavy but its alot of battery. Before I bought this portable battery I would carry a mini jump start battery which worked well but didn't look as cool, it had only 1 usb port and cost twice as much. This charger is super simple highly recommend."
I expected more coverage on the top and bottom.
Exactly as pictured ... Too long on shipping
Works
"My mom works at A hotel. She can talk on the phone as long as she stays busy. However, she can't hold the phone and work at the same time. I seen the iGearPro on Amazon and knew it would be perfect for her.<br /><br />  The iGearPro gives her options. She can listen to music or talk on the phone with it. The device is very small. When she wears it, you can't tell. Her hair covers it. It connects to her iPhone 4s quickly and has good signal. It's charged by a micro USB cord that's included. When it's fully charged, the battery life is great.<br /><br />  My mom really loves the iGearPro. I feel like you can't beat the price. I was sent this product to test and review. I am in no way compensated for this. I am honest when I say, this product is wonderful!"
"After taking a few days to research the current crop of smartwatches and reading what others had to say about their smartwatch experiences I chose to give the Moto 360 a try and I'm glad I did.  None of the currently available 1st generation watches are likely to fit everyone's tastes but I found the Moto 360 to be a beautiful and functional watch and as it is currently on sale its an exceptional value.  Out of the box the watch is easy to set up and prompts you to update to the latest version of the Android OS, Lollipop.  The watch paired easily with my Alcatel Tracfone and sends timely notifications and e-mails conveniently to my wrist.  I love it!  For those that feel variety is the spice of life you will find many watch faces available in the Google Play store.  Some folks seem overly concerned with battery life on these watches.  I put my watch In the wireless charger before I go to bed at night and its ready to go in the morning.  Even with ambient mode selected and with moderate use the charge lasts me all day.  When I bought this watch I wondered if I would find it useful but after wearing it for a week I know that if I didn't have it I'd miss it.  I'm happy with the Moto 360 and would buy it again without hesitation."
Sucked threw in trash
Excellent quality product for price that should outlast other synthetic products three times.
So tiny yet so useful. I don't like carrying a wallet most of the time so this CardBuddy stretch allows me to carry just the essentials a credit card some cash and Id and bus card. 5 stars works great and gets the job done. Attaches to phone or case. I received a discounted sample in exchange for an unbiased review.
Works like a charm!
This case is sooo cheap. The &#34;logo&#34; was a sticker and instantly came off. After about two hours the cover came off of the while case.  This case is worth like a dollar or two.
Exactly what we wanted. Sturdy.
"All 5 ports charge my iPad while in use, both outlets work and its definitely nicer than having 4 wall chargers plugged into a power strip.  So far so good.  Update 3/18/2016 still working great.  Update 12/20/2016 now 100% worthless, ports deliver a maximum of 300 ma, unless I plug in 3 or more devices then its even less."
This case was not what I thought it would be don't like it at all
"This was the last commercial base station antenna that I'll buy. The assembly instructions are not great, but tolerable. My biggest problem, though is the claim that no tuning or adjustment is necessary. Bulls***! My antenna, fully assembled and tested at least 10 feet away from anything, including the ground, showed a 2:1 bandwidth from about 144.5 MHz to about 147.5 MHz. Not enough to cover even the FM portion of 2m. On 440, the situation is even worse. Resonance lands at about 435 MHz and the 2:1 mark is passed at about 438 MHz. In the transmit portion of the FM repeater section of the band, it's already over 3:1, so unusable on that band, and far from what is claimed.    Today, I built a \\""flower pot\\"" vertical dual band antenna from about $10 worth of parts, and it outshines this piece of crap by a landslide in terms of both usable bandwidth and on-air performance. I'm going to give this Tram to my dad and let him see if he can get it to work or use it as a mono-band antenna. I'll be homebrewing my base station antennas from now on."
"The speaker sounded great and had awsome volume for such a small speaker, but it started making a high pitched whining noise after I tested it at full volume."
"Adorable design, but hilariously poor quality. You get what you pay for."
Fast charging. Works well with my phones and tablets.
Love it
Holds iPhone 6 securely. Works great.
So far it's still sticking. Gtmat seems to be made right. Price and quality. What more could I ask for
"Quality is not great but for the price is completely acceptable. Very cool design and zipper works easily; cloth cord does not tangle much. Bought these mostly for the cool and anti-tangle design, very pleased with it. Would be 5 star if not for the sound quality but I would buy these again if I needed another pair of cheap earbuds to toss in a bag and take out without having to spend ten minutes detangling them."
"This case help if you just drop your phone, it does not protect prom the water at all, but on the box it says that this case can protect your phone under water around 6 feet deep for a 1 hour. This case is just waist of money. And yeah, they doesn't replace my phone, they just send me a new case. Why do I need a new case if my phone is not working?"
Perfect. Batteries hold charge well. Better than my q year old OEM samsung battery
This is good
It's a good case but it's hard to take off
"Do you like trying to piece together broken English? Do you enjoy the rage the comes with putting together a selfie stick with no instructions? Than look no further than the Urpower selfie stick!<br /><br />First of all, the English was heinous. I've traveled to 15 countries and I've never been more confused than I was trying to put this together.<br /><br />The instructions also must be focused on some older or newer model than my phone, because it instructs you to open the camera and click on the gear icon. Welp, the gear icon doesn't exist. So that was a delight.<br /><br />I guarantee that I was putting it together incorrectly, but my phone was very flimsy and loose in the selfie stick. I'm taking this bad boy on a road trip with me and am going to be holding it over the cliffs of Acadia in Maine? Probably not.<br /><br />I will return, 100%. I would not recommend this product unless you're some sort of engineer, speak broken English fluently, or have enough wine to give you some clarity on how to set this up."
They work as stated I've not had any problems .
Just wat she wanted
I purchased this cover for my first smart phone. After the sticker shock I decided to find a cheap but good quality case. I am very pleased with this case. It does the job and added bonus of being stylish. I had no problems putting this on the phone.
"Bought this for our 14 year old daughter and she loves it. It was easy to sync with her iPhone 5s. Daughter likes it because there is no remote, the shutter button is on the handle so no remotes to lose. Selfies are being taken all the time now."
Doesn't work at all with Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. I've tried every position with and without the case. Useless.
I love this case but wish it had a handle connected to case for carring
It craped out after a month
"STOP LOOKING! I tried 2 other screen replacements and they either didn't work, or was missing cables. This has it all and spare parts. 5 minute job tops if you already have the screen off."
Awesome product so far! Great for use at the pool where limited charging is available. Would buy again!
Love love love it
My husband Loved it feels great and works awesome
Great purchase.
"When I first bought this product I thought it would be a cheap poorly made speaker but it turned out when I received it, it was already partly charged and I had no problems connecting it to my phones Bluetooth. The sound was surprisingly loud for its compact size. The suction cup on the bottom worked perfectly fine on my wall and my window. On the device there are volume up, volume down, and play/pause buttons. There is also an on/off switch and a led light indicator. Overall this is a great product for the price."
Where has this product been my entire life? It protects my phone from the worst abuse that I can throw at it. I've dropped a handgun on the screen by accident and it just bounced off (though I haven't tried SHOOTING the screen protector). Fits into my Incipio branded two-piece case too.<br /><br />Tip for applying the screen: take a couple strips of tape and tape one side of the screen protector to the phone (so you can lift it up like opening a book cover). Remove the film to expose the adhesive and &#34;close the book&#34; so there's a perfect fit.
Screen protector is good quality but too small for the phone screen; perhaps it is meant to be covered by the case?
"Love these cases, lightweight and fit sung the rubber on the outside edges keeps them from slipping out of your hand."
"This headset is an excellent product especially for the price.  It was a little tricky at first getting the bluetooth to connect but once connected, the headset worked like a charm.  I use my mobile phone as my work phone and this headset makes it sound like I am on my handset and it does have decent amount of noise cancelling.  I would definitely recommend this wireless headset."
"Out of a group of about 10 cases for iPhone 6 Plus, I think this is the best one all around.<br /><br />It's extremely similar to Ballistic's clear case (which I love), but is slimmer, uses a differently tinted plastic, and has a different design on back.<br /><br />This has a great feel to it that is slick, yet has grip when needed. It is not bulky at all and slim. It has the air cushions on the corners for great drop protection. Cut-outs and button alignment are good.  I like the line design on the back.<br /><br />You really can't beat this case so far."
Awesome case!
No comments
I know a lot of people who purchased from this seller so I thought to give them a try. I received a discount on my order for a fair review and this charger works really well. I will be purchasing more soon as backups since my puppy like to chew on my cords lol.
"didnt work out for me display was scrambled purple and white you might have much better luck than me, if you have a problem do contact seller"
Just what I needed at a great price!
"4 stars and not 5 because the watch gets to my hands 16 days later but, its attached perfect with my iphone very good watch!!"
This start to broke the second day of used. I received the phone on wesneday and by friday it was crake on the top left. See the picture below.
Great!
Great charger that has saved me quite a few time!  Took this with me to Disneyland where we stayed all day. I was able to keep my phone charged all day which was perfect since I took a ton of pictures which normally drains my battery.  I was able to charge up two cell phones that day with one charge to this charger and that alone made this purchase worth it!
"I ordered this for my dad and he loved it 😊 , fits his phone perfectly and came in quick . Good Quality 👌🏽"
This is not 4 gauge.  4 guage has a conductor diameter of roughly 0.232 in.  This has a diameter of about 0.199  which is almost 6 gauge.  Go with XS power 4 guage.  It isn't much more expensive and is good quality.  Theirs measures at around 0.261
Walmart now has this phone for $49. I am stunned a piece of tech this advanced can be purchased so cheaply nowadays. This phone feels like it costs $200+. I broke my galaxy s4 mini and picked this phone up at Walmart. I like this phone equally as much at a fraction of the price. The screen isn't quite as good on  paper but looks just as good as the s4 mini. The camera isn't quite as good but it still takes pretty impressive pics. It handles android 5.1 like a phone that costs 5x the price.<br /><br />I am not sure if there is a way to bypass the activation screen but if so this phone is a steal without even using it as a phone. I rarely write reviews but I am so satisfied I felt I had to share how I felt and hopefully sway a few people that are about to spend hundreds of dollars to just save it.
Fast.
Works great for my Galaxy S3 with slim case!  My phone never fails to charge (as it does sometimes when I plug a charging cord in)
Wow! Great product.  Fast shipping.  Can't ask for more : D
my favorite case.
better than expected
"Worked ok for a month battery life was only two hours, and then the week after the Amazon 30 day return expired they would not charge or turn on.  Don't buy. I had seen some reviews that they were junk but the overall review were positive so I bought a pair and had the same problem all the one star reviews said I would."
It had more scratches on the back then what I expected!
"These screen protectors are some of the best I've ever used.<br /><br />It was easy to apply the screen protector using the instructions and applicators that were included, and I didn't end up with a single air bubble once it was completed. It's a lot better quality than most I've purchased on Amazon in the past. I can tell it won't need to be replaced for a long time. The anti-glare and anti-liquid features work as advertised.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying from iCarez again in the future."
I always carry it with me wherever I go :D
This headset outs terrible. My husband is used to the lg but we got this one for fear of getting a knock off version of his beloved lg set. This had no range and I can barley heart him when he talks. I purchased out awhile back for him. He keeps putting it in the drawer for use if his beloved lg broke again. This week the inevitable did happen and yes he went to using this thing. He hates it and I hate hearing about how much he hates it.  Now if you do not have a superior set you've used previously it may be ok for you. He has to have an easy too hide set so it doesn't show on his uniform at work with good range. He also listens tho music all the time too when He's running and working out. He's on the phone all the time and it has to be something easily hidden and comfortable to use. For some reason it seems tho be just the opposite for him. So anyway this it's my honest review but like I said you may not be as picky as he is.
"Worked for a few months, but now doesn't charge any Apple product that we have.  Product had potential but now is useless for lighting applications."
Watched their installation video and followed the isntructions but  air bubbles don't go away even witha  squegee.  Used 2nd protector. same thing.<br />I've used a few other screen protector brands and this has to be the worst!
Perfect for my 02 escape
Worked great exact replacement Sirius sportster 5 very satisfied
"Did all the prep work (clean, microfiber, dust removal) and this baby went on absolutely perfectly. Not a single bubble or speck of dust. Never had a screen protector apply itself so well. Also looks great and touch response is unaffected. Couldn't be happier."
"After 1 month of use, it burned up and also burned the cable while charging my iphone. Thanks god it didn't broke the phone."
Very reasonable price. Seems to be a quality product.
Charges fast. Excellent price. Works great
It was great
Needed a long cord and this filled the bill.<br />Sasha
"Case fits perfectly. Speaker ports were already cut out, and the perfect size. Its not as diesel as it looks, but its an ok case for the price. The holster clip is surprisingly strong as well"
"Fits well, makes black phone easier to find, and has protected against a couple of drops."
"A super thin metal plate inside my phone cover and that's it. The magnet grabs and holds the phone in place. It's strong. Everybody that sees it, thinks it's very cool."
"Awesome phone!!! I gave a shot to this phone based on reviews seen online and I love it! Fast phone, screen looks sharp and the phone looks great. The shipping was extremely fast. It arrived before the expected date. I recommend it..."
It work very well...
Perfect!
as expected
Love this case and colors!! Great protection!!
Great case and cool color too.
Excellent application.
pi got this item at a deep discount to try and review and give my honest opinion it was shipped fast and works for my needs
"Love it, great item"
"Cannot beat the price, though the screen is crap and the device can occasionally be sluggish."
it's an alright case except the screen gets dirty on inside faster than outside and very hard to clean
Excellent item for a very economical price.
Not real wood. But. Real wood would not last. Awesome look case and deal. Screen protector and stylus handy too
10 cent piece of plastic. It does a good job but scratches easily. Really the military film shields are the way to go.
"Great product but after couple weeks stopped working. I Kept it in perfect condition also. No sweating , no drops , no water and still stopped working. Cheap quality. DO NOT BUY!"
"The belt clip is very cheaply made, I've had to order 5 replacement belt clips and won't be buying another"
"Love my mophie juice pack, I work long hours and often use my battery pack.  I have dropped it several times and the case actually is quite protective as well !"
Great nDeal. Runs a little slower with 2 sims active
Excellent product.  The four charge slots performed flawlessly and fast.
Good
This product is incompatible with the stock 2007 VW Jetta.
Works great as a transmitter to my Bluetooth earbuds for watching TV late at night. Does not work while USB charging.
Didn't work. Did the same thing my old batteryou did.
Great protection for phone and went on easily
"just wasn't what I thought it would be, it connects to my phone fine, but I have to continue to download different apps to access all the features of the phone, music app, workout app, a app to download other apps its just too much for one off brand device"
Love it works great haven't had any trouble with it
Mic doesn't work at all can't make phone calls. If you referbish a phone you should make sure all of it works before you sell it
"It worked for a little bit but then the little claps all started breaking off. And the little circle that shows the Apple symbol started cracking and it drove me crazy, so now I use a different case."
great
I bought these during the Prime Sale and like them. The colors & texture of these cords help make them easy to find.
"Very clear, though sometimes disconnects from the phone for no apparent reason.  I think it is more comfortable than the competition."
Wonderful quality...
can't charge for more then 10sec's even with a 2 amp USB
Great tools.
I'm not really into headphones so much but really needed something that I could use while I'm at work. (Complicated job --- can use cell while working but must be hidden!) I like to not only listen to music while working but to be able to answer calls in case I am needed! These did the trick! im<br />I was so happy they came with multiple ear pieces for comfort! And the sound was seriously amazing. (I work at a grocery store and it tuned out ALL the noise of people!!!)<br />You would think &#34;where do I charge these?&#34; But it's right ln the side of the ear bud. And also able to charge these portibly so that's awesome!<br />I can't say anything about the sweat and water resistance because I've never used them to that extent BUT they feel like they would live up to that!!<br />Shipping was FASTER than expected and I really love that! Also fit right in my mailbox. (EVEN BETTER! We live in apartments and our mailboxes are SMALL!!)<br />I was able to get this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review - and that is exactly what you've just read!!<br />Attached are photos of an earbud close up and the other is the whole product along with the charging cord attached!!
Item broke already
As described fits perfectly. Sunday deliver wasn't expecting that.
"Easy to apply, very durable, and the cutout makes it so you can put a case on your phone without difficulties. I ended up ordering another set about 5 months later."
Used it for a week with no other electricity. Worked as it should.<br />A pocket underneath would be great so the phone & charging battery could be tucked away during charge.
I love it
Works well
Love the phone. Upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the HTC One. Very user friendly. Good price and fast shipping.
Great case. Slick and protects  my phone.  Only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars is because if the air bubbles created in the back seethru side. None the less the best case ive purchased for the s6 (tried 4 already)
"this stand stinks!!! it doesn't stay up , keeps falling down every time i attempt to set it up.  iYou get waht you pay for. :/"
very superior Case 5 Stars
Very good product. Perfect fit.
These are great screen protectors. My mobile provider doesn't sell the correct size in store so I first wasted $12 for one that didn't fit...  Finding this excellent alternative online was perfect! Fast shipping!
"Poor quality, only half the functions work at once, wouldn't charge and display HDMI at the same time. the connector bends when I plug it in to my phone and lay it on the table. DO NOT BUY."
"The case has plenty of protection, and looks sleek. It slides out of pockets easily without pulling the fabric upwards. Since I put this case on about a month ago my phone has taken some serious tumbles and has come out unharmed.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the interior gray plastic flexible case is a little bit loose, especially around the bottom of the phone by the button. The thin strip of rubber there wiggles around a bit and there's a gap between the rubber and the plastic. I've just been kind of stuffing the rubbery part under the plastic and it's worked fine."
"Good hardy case.  Not stylish, but gets the job done."
I works perfectly ... I'm glad I got this!
Super sturdy. Has a screen protector built in. Plugs the charge and ear bud holes
Worked good.
"Did not line up perfectly on my Samsung Avant, and it did not install bubble free."
As described
"Within 2 hours of m review of the product, The retailer has contacted me (Via Text, phone, and email) to offer a return. Mind you, i ordered the product on march 27th and it is currently August 30th. I am amazed at this service. Sure i may not be happy with the product, but i am amazed by the dedication of the team behind this product.<br /><br />Here is my new more in depth review.<br />Audio: This device lacks in terms of audio quality. The headphones seem to focus more on highs and mids (which i prefer), but even then, the sound is distorted, as if listening to a small speaker which has been place in a cup.<br />Comfort: I understand that comfort can be subjective when dealing with in-ear equipment, but i find these to be incredibly uncomfortable. I have tried using different sized rubber on these things, but i can't seem to wear them for more than 15 minutes before i begin to have a headache. I believe this is due to the added weight of the earbuds (the battery and electronics are stored within the buds themselves, making them heavier than your average earbuds).<br />Form factor: The headset seems to stick out a little bit giving the weight a little more leverage to pull them out. This could be fixed by shortening the length of the earpiece by a few fractions of a centimeter or moving the center of gravity closer to the ear.<br />Battery life: I found that this device has amazing battery life for the size of the product, and it seems to hold a charge in standby mode. I haven't used this device for over two months, yet i was able to turn it on.<br />Cable length: Cable length is just about right, not too little where they can't hang comfortably, but not so much that they get caught on everything while being used.<br />Buttons: The volume buttons are placed perfectly. they are very easy to reach, and give a satisfying click when pressed.<br /><br />All in all, the GS-08's underperformed where it counted for me. I have since moved on to a pair of LG tones which i have found to be much more comfortable. Even though i may not like/use the GLYCON GS-08's, i would gladly purchase another product from them.gh i may not like/use the GLYCON GS-08's, i would gladly purchase another product from them."
Received timely - fit phone
"The space for cards is not big enough, resulting in broken after two months."
"Great product, but I have only used for 3 days since the first one came defective.  They replaced it right away for me by the way."
Bought this for an iPhone 6 after reading great reviews. First time the phone was dropped (about 3 feet onto tile) the screen shattered. Otterboxes seem to protect our phones much better
One rainstorm and it shorted out. Product is not waterproof. Worked perfectly prior to that though.
"Easy to setup and use, my husband and I loved it! Made pictures of us on vacation possible"
"This thing is great for traveling, especially if you've got a family with lots of devices"
"these are the best , wear these for jogging ,boxing and working out - if they ever stop working I will buy another pair that day. (Great product)"
"I’ve been using this external battery charger for a week now and it has been working great as I’d expect from any Anker product! I’ve used it to charge my Samsung Galaxy S5 and my Acer Tablet a few times and it works as expected. This is really not a complex product, it has a micro USB input charging port so that way you can charge the battery using a USB charger of some sort. It’s a 13400mAh capacity battery so it does take several hours to charge it, just plug it in and leave it overnight and you’re good in the morning.  It has 2 full size USB ports to plug your devices into and charge, they’re standard Anker PowerIQ USB ports so you can plug anything in and charge it without having to worry about anything. It can output 2.4 amps per USB port so it can charge your phone/tablet in a hurry.  There is a little button on the front of this external battery that you can press and it lights up a circle of LED lights to indicate how much juice is left in the battery, it’s a nifty little feature so that way you know when this external battery needs to be recharged. This battery charger is about the size of a wallet, very portable and heavy for its size of course since it’s packed full of battery cells. I like the look and feel of it, it’s certainly not an eye sore. I think it will fit right in sitting right next to your phone/tablet/whatever device you have. So bottom line, this external battery charger will charge your phone multiple times and it’s very easy to use. Anker backs it up with an 18 month warranty as well so they got you covered if the unfortunate should ever happen. I attached pictures of my unit to this review as well, it’s charging my Acer Tablet and Samsung GS5 at the same time."
Looked cool and I bought it cheap. After about a few weeks using the little kickstand it broke off. I won't get this model ever again.
Device broke down in 2 months of use.  Does not turn on.
The ONLY tool you need to worry about is the thin wire to remove your broken screen.... two were included and both broke multiple times... if I heated my phone to the surface temperature of the sun they may have worked. I broke my digitizer trying...
Great guy. Great price. Thin case fits phone perfectly. Thank you!
"I have up graded my iPhone 5 but keep it and use it as a player for my audio books.  With this Horn Stand, it now is loud enough to hear without earbuds or external speaker that needs recharging.  The case protects my phone and the horn speaker works as well as a rechargeable one.  Great product!"
GREAT
L o v e it. Has lots of room. Good quality. Fast shipping. Good packing.
This product does not function properly  https://youtu.be/AoBPZm8xcys
We ordered a case for an IPhone 4 and received a case for an IPhone 6..
"I love this and it is top quality for a great price, hasnt ripped or been scratched up from dropping it or anything."
ok
Worked as expected. Was necessary to adapt existing harness to the aftermarket speakers.
Good!
This screen protector came equipped with all you need to clean and flatted the fit to perfection. It was easy to apply with no air bubbles. I love it!!! I recommend this product to everyone with a cell phone.
I own jay birds i love them but i was shocked at quality of these for price would buy again.
It works perfect
Super nice!
the product is fine
"Works well.  This is a replacement for an old cover that was placed in dryer by mistake (heat melts an inner liner).  The seat does slide as I enter and exit the car, that is my only complaint.  There is another model that is advertised as non-slip but I didn't purchase it.  I had my last one for over 10 years with no problems."
Good quality and super cute. Love taking my phone out in public with this case on.
"nice phone,"
I've used a lot of different screen protectors on the various phones I've had over the years & this has got to be the best one I've ever had!! Was a little intimidated when I saw how thick it was but installation was very easy. Just make sure you follow the instructions and install it in a clean dust free area and you won't be disappointed!!
"Thought it was a great case, but then the sleep/wake button at the top of of the case broke off. Spigen won't fix or replace even though the case is only 5 months old because I brought it through an authorized retailer (Amazon)."
Great product! Just as described.
"The battery works as expected, restoring my phone's battery life to what I estimate is comparable to its original life when my Nexus 5 was new. I've been using the replacement for three weeks with no problems."
It works great
"Bought this for my recent trip to Asia and it did not disappoint.  I was able to recharge my phone battery twice a day which was critical for me using GPS to navigate.  Very reliable, I was very pleased."
Quick ship and item is just as described!
Works as advertised. Very convenient.
Very nice thank you
I've owned more expensive wireless headsets but they don't perform any better.  This is my fav and when I've lost it and had to reorder... this is my go to headset!
This case blocked my phone from signal
Great product. This one fits a Sportage 2012 full edition remote control
I could not get it to charge in my car
Did not think I would find these batteries due to the age of the equipment.... but these batteries fit like the originals. Charged just fine and work perfectly.
Like the cover so people to my left can't see what I'm looking at!
"Bought this phone last year, received the wrong item (Black - Boost Mobile version), never did send it back, although I was disappointed."
"Perfect fit for my Bose unit, the handle makes it easier to carry without dropping it."
Works well with Kurio and other devices.
"Very sturdy, keeps phone nice and safe!"
Exactly  what I was looking for - works great.
Love it great phone!!
Delivered on time. Works much better than the junk ones for $5.
Prongs broke on day three so won't charge phone
Did not fit properly
Good product
"Love it! Cheap yet durable, long battery life and sounds great..good product all round."
Did not fit my phone at all...this case is not for a s6
Loud enough to listen to in a decent size room. Has a good amount of bass for such a small speaker. Would definitely buy again
"Love the look, the feel, the sturdiness. This color combo is really sleek and unique."
Good
"I love the case design, but definitely isn't the most protection. Granted I have dropped my phone a few times and it has lived without scratches or cracks lol"
"I was a little concerned because it came wrapped in plastic but not in an original box, but it does appear to be an original Samsung battery and works as well as the one I received with my phone.  The only difference in the labeling on the battery between this and my original is the country of origin. (Yes, that made me wonder, but like I said, the one I received does work as well as the one that came with my Galaxy).  I do not use NFC for anything, so I cannot confirm whether that aspect works or not."
Does what it says. I keep it on my dash and has not fallen off yet.
Excellent
Really cute!
Only two of the charger cables worked. The third cable did not work at all.
Works great to keep all my devices charges
It worked for me
Decent quality sound.  Decent range device to headphones.  Comfortable to wear. Easy pairing with phone and computer.  And all at an affordable price!
exact replacement
"I love it! The quality isn't the absolute best but it's good enough and the colors are so pretty, I've had for months now and still can't bring myself to change it for another one, even though I like change themy often"
"What do you know, my 1 yr old smashed my phone on week 1 of me buying the glass protector. It shattered but the screen did not! yes! Does exactly what it needs to do.<br /><br />Easy to apply, looking through instructions beforehand was more useful 2nd time ;)"
perfecto
looks very nice on my phone..
Just as expected!
Case came in a timley manner.  All was good and as expected.  Would purchase from here again.
Love it just what I wanted
Worked as advertised. Need to charge an iPad while on holiday and did not disappoint.
This case was a piece of crap. It was not shockproof or dirt proof. Save your money.
Can't keep the corners down on the product. But this is most likely something I did wrong on installation
Did not work. Glad I paid $9 for it.
"This is a fantastic product! I purchased it to use while on a 2,500 mile road trip and it performed flawlessly. Sticks to my textured dash without any problems and provides quick and easy access to my iPhone 6."
This cord was torn when it arrived. My husband and I waited a month to receive the cord. We had to throw it away
very pretty!
"This phone case is great! I got it as a Christmas present and it has protected my phone amazingly well. I have dropped it a lot (hence my needing a high impact case) and I've dropped it on hard surfaces like concrete (even accidentally dropped it down a flight of stairs) and it has held up really well.  My only complaint is that the case cracked in the corner after about 6 months and now gapes open (but that's just as much my fault for dropping it so often). I've been lazy and haven't gotten a new case yet, but even with the break, it still protects my phone! I dropped it on my tile bathroom floor just a couple of days ago and even though the case actually flew apart my phone was still okay.  That's one bad thing that happens with this case - if it drops really hard the case will actually come open a little bit, but it's not a big deal, you just snap it back together and it's fine. I would definitely buy this case again!"
Does not work on all model Toyota trucks.
Works as advertised for my Nexus 6.
The rhinestones were coming off when I received the case. The case does not fit the Galaxy S6 as it should and all the edges of the phone are uncovered. Not pleased.
Ordered this to use for a backup charger to throw in my bag. Like that you can swap USB cords. Shipping was good especially as it's coming from China. Had it for about s month and is working great.
Very dissatisfied. The car charger has ready become defective and it's only a few days past 30days so I'm unable to return.
"I'm usually no good at installing screen protectors, but I have to hand it to Anker on devising quite an interesting procedure. They provide &#34;hinge&#34; stickers to attach to the protector and your device, which ensures the placement is spot-on. It also avoids picking up dust while you're attaching the protector. The protector is clear as crystal and there's no distortion like with some other types. I haven't dropped my device (knock on wood), so I can't say anything about how it behaves in that scenario. All in all, a good purchase, a good quality product, and worth the money spent!"
Great
"I really need this for my workday. I work out in the field and can't get to a charger. This one is awesome and so portable. It looks very sophisticated so I don't mind pulling it out of my bag and charging my phone. I would recommend this for those who can't always get to a charger/outlet to charge their phone during the workday, play day or any day."
Great little bluetooth speaker
Tried this out to make sure it would charge my iPhone 6.  It does.  Looking forward to trips with the kids and keeping all devices charged.
So far I love these headphones. They stay put whether I'm running long distances or working out at the gym. It's easy to use and functions well.
"Works perfectly, and though its a bit tough to get on, when its on you know it won't slip around or get out of shape.  Have not actually put it too the test by dropping the phone, but I feel confident it will work and the extra rubber corners seem very effective.  The pen does not offer any value to me and I would have been just as happy if it was not in the package, but there's nothing wrong with it."
"Works and looks great. Charging is a bit slow, but I use it to charge my phone overnight on the night stand."
Earbuds are better than expected
"Use this item for various things.  Have one mounted to hold a GO Pro in various situations, a security camera, and a GPS in a RZR.  This is the shorter size and hold items very securely and takes up the least amount of room of the double socket arms.  I also use the longer double socket arms where more length is needed, but I find this length to be the most useful for my needs.  Really like the adjustability that the double socket ends gives you. Use this with a Ram Tough Claw and your mounting possibilities are nearly endless."
I keep it in my travel bag and use it in rental cars.  It's easy to pack and can accommodate an iPhone 6 and even a Nexus 6.
Excellent seller.<br />100% recommended.<br />Thank you
You get what you pay for. Very cute though.
Loves it
Nice case.  Thin adds little bulk to the phone.  Buttons do not have a tactile feel to differentiate them from one another.  Others have complained of difficulty inserting ear phone jacks but I have not experienced this with two different ear sets.
Did not work 1st use keeps falling
"best bang for your buck, really love it"
Love them
"This case just came today and it fits really well on my phone.  I like the design, too.  It's relatively simple but effective.  It's a hard case so it's definitely more durable, and it really relieves a lot of the worries of damaging my brand new phone.  Unfortunately, the power button isn't working for me.  The volume buttons work fine, and it's possible to turn the phone on and off by touching the button on the bottom of the screen, but the case's power button doesn't press hard enough to push against the actual power button on the phone.  Still, it's a nice case, and definitely should hold up against daily use with my phone.<br /><br />EDIT: After a week or so of use I'm revising my review to say this case is awesome.  I've dropped my phone 3 times and a few chips on my case, but absolutely no issues with my phone.  The power button is working, almost a little too well... (I accidentally bump it from time to time.)<br /><br />I received this item at a discount in return for my honest review."
Worked great. Excellent replacement part.
"Great back up or emergency batteries. These hold a charge just as long as the original samsung battery. Down side, when taking photos with your camera you can not use your flash. If you try to take a photo using your flash your phone will shut down. I use these batteries when my Lomui 3800 mah battery is getting low. Just keep one in my wallet and the other in my back pack. Once a month I discharge them and then recharge them to keep the batteries healthy and ready for emergencies."
"It is great.  Easy to use.  Works.  You can just leave a battery sitting on top of it and it will charge it.  I am doing this because the charging back has arrived yet.  I am sure that will work just as well.  Too bad Samsung didn't put on in my Note 4 when they designed the thing in the first place, just another example of them falling away from what consumers want."
"Brilliant no nonsense GPS, well worth the money."
Recvd on time . Reception good most of the time. Audio on other end said to be faint.
"It's a great design I like the way it attached to the cover, but the cover spontaneously broke! Kinda disappointed"
Charges quickly but the light on the end is too sensitive. If I use my phone while plugged in it shines in my eyes
"Love this case!  Holds phone, money, ID."
"Worked great at the Electric Forest Festival, came in very handy."
Terrible - won't hold a charge.  Refurbished nightmare  -  if we hadn't been in such a bind I never would have bought this
It does not protect your privacy as well as the tech armor. For the price I thought it would be better but nope. You can see everything from the sides.
not what I was looking for
My husband is very pleased with the cover.  Great product
"I am not one to usually write amazon reviews but I felt compelled after putting this product on...  I can say, without a doubt, this was the single easiest screen protector installation I have ever done. Wow... I was shocked how painless that was.  I have always had a love hate with screen protectors and more recently opted to stop using them for about a year. Of course, though, since getting my Note 4 a few days ago I was having new phone jitters so I caved and ordered one. I have never tried these tempered glass variants before but heard good things so for the price of this one I thought why not.  I got to say... again... Wow. The installation... flawless. Just immediately goes on and works itself onto the screen with no air bubbles or needing any sort of credit card smoothing for 20min.  Instructions on the screen protector was really easy to follow and it comes with everything you need to get it installed.  *You're Awesome Thank You card *Dust-absorber *Wet *Dry *Glass Screen Protector  ************************************************  The correct order of application is: 1. Use the WET cleaning pad on the phone screen. 2. Use the DRY wipe to completely dry the phone screen. 3. Use the Dust-absorber to remove dust which may have settled. 4. Remove the label &#34;①Step&#34; from the glass screen protector. 5. Gently press the middle of the glass screen protector, then ensure the protector has no air pockets by pressing gently but firmly against it from the center outward.    In terms of the actual feel and look of it? It feels great. I am really pleasantly surprised by this protector (granted it has only been about 10 min). It truly feels like nothing is on the screen but at the same time feels like a great layer of protection. It is clear, with no noticeable deterioration of screen quality.  Another point worth mentioning. The packaging of this brand of protector is fantastic. Comes in a hard cardboard book style inclosure. Provides 1 screen protector with a anti static wipe cloth as well as a alcohol prep tab. 10/10 for packaging. Well done Yootech. I don't think I have ever seen better packaging for a screen protector.  I may have found a rejuvenated love for screen protectors now because of tempered glass, and especially this brand. The purchase of this protector is a no brainer. You cannot beat the price for what you get."
Love the compact design and the fact you can store a battery inside between use.
Loud and crystal clear sound
This was very easy to install. It has a good fit and very few finger prints get on the glass.
I got this for my daughter and her husband to take on vacation.  They used it on the beach and the sound was wonderful.  I paid for the one day delivery so they would have it by the time they left.  That extra one day delivery payment was well worth it.
"Dose not work, waste<br />Of money"
Sounds really good
"Good, simple TPU case.  Fits well."
This case was exactly as I expected and works great!
"I absolutely loved it. It fits my phone so good. But the top was sort of hard to get on, but it's still good. I love the color of cover and it does get dirty easily so be careful! Lol. Loved it."
2nd one purchased
great buy
Fast delivery and great case!
I love the watch! Getting my emails and calls without having to carry my phone in my hand is so convenient. But you have to be within range of your cell phone
It feels very resistant to impact. I just hope it doesn't turn yellow over time.
"Worked great when I first put it on a back in late July.  Now, it fits loosely and I expect wouldn't keep the water out if I dared to test it."
"A must have for Iphone 6 + as the bare chassis is slick and will slide out of your hand. This full carbon fiber case is incredibly light, adding limited bulk to the already big phone. The case has a great tactile coating making it tacky and easy to grip. The chrome apple logo is hidden by the case which is my preference as the logo is the tackiest and least aesthetic appealing thing about Iphone 6s."
Came on time it's good quality and the extra port is useful
worked great
love this case! not bulky but with good coverage. great design. loved the color!
"Fits perfectly, feels really good, and the phone still feels slim. I would buy this item again."
Add a Moment wide angle lens and a Monfroto pan head and it makes a great panorama with 8 shots around that fits in your pocket.
Got a great deal on this.  Should have ordered a few more?
"This is a great product! We bought this to go on vacation to Florida and it was one of the best purchases we made. It rained constantly in Florida and or course there was the beach. We got plenty of use out of this. The only thing I didn't like was how big and bulky it was, but it's definitely not a deal breaker. Great product!"
perfect
good
love this. white gets dirty fast
"I actually really love this new way to combine my Wallet and IPhone 6+<br />I had a Metal Money Clip which I used and loved, but after 3 scratched credit cards I had to replace it, I threw in the towel.<br /><br />I like this one for a few reasons.  * The Pictures here are very accurate.  A tad heavier than a plain plastic case.<br /><br />1. Great Leather Feel, so much better a feel in my hand vs. plastic.<br />2. The Clip magnetically snaps. It doesn't move unless you move it. But cleanly is great for a stand to watch videos.<br />3. Good Tough Guy Look and feel. None of those clasps that Women uses for their purses.  This is simple and tough!<br />4. I keep three 20s in the lower part and my 2 credit cards and Drivers License in the top.<br /><br />My funny comment is after I put it in my Pocket, I for the first few days kept thinking 'Where is my Wallet'<br /><br />This keeps everything in One place, and for those like me who put their wallet in the bathroom, closet, kitchen, dining room and random places only to find you are now late for work... You get me.  IPhone 'Find my Phone' works in 1 minute, madly searching your house, pants etc... take forever and frustrating.<br /><br />Simple, Amazing Quality Leather, Slim and Cool.  I absolutely recommend this for anyone who doesn't have that<br /> &#34;George Castanza&#34; Mongo huge wallet.  And really do you ever need that 8&#34; of Wallet in your Pocket.<br /><br />Go Slim, the Ladies Love it!"
Reasonable price and quick shipping speed.
Easy to apply and works very well.
"This is a fantastic head unit.  Installed this with my factory sound system and did the Auto EQ / Time Delay adjustment and it made my system sound much better.  Eventually replaced the factory speakers with JBLs and a sub, did the Auto EQ again and bam, amazingness.<br /><br />The only thing that sucks about this unit:<br /><br />No FLAC Support :(<br /><br />No 64GB SDCard support.  Haven't tried 64GB USB sticks.  Will read 32GB SD Cards<br /><br /> Bluetooth support is meh.  Android will support changing tracks from the head unit / remote, iPod / iphone via bluetooth will not.  USB iphone/ ipod works perfectly.  I wish it would support metadata via bluetooth; like song names or currently playing internet radio station, but it does not.<br /><br />A small issue: when visualisation is active on the unit, and you hit 'DISP' to see the title of the current playing track or radio station, it will only display for 2 seconds - it will occasionally not scroll through the entire name in that time, so you will only catch the first 12 characters of whatever your playing off your SD card or removable media.  If the visualisation is off, it will constantly scroll the entire track name.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants high quality audio control of their vehicle but does not want to outfit their whip with a bulky multimedia display"
Slim case that shows the beauty of the iPhone but not slippery like other clear cases I previously owned and the ports are high enough for all types of lightning cables and all types of headphones and the speaker holes are exact
"This case is pretty good and does its job well. The only problem I have with it is that it is a gold color, and not the bright yellow that it is pictured to be on Amazon. I wish that the correct color could have been shown in Amazon when I was looking to purchase it. Update on October 20, 2015- I wanted a red case for my Galaxy J1, to keep in mind God's wonderful gift of salvation to us, through &#34;the blood of Jesus Christ his Son (that) cleanseth us from all sin.&#34; 1 John 1:7, KJV. I checked out several red cases for the Samsung Galaxy J1, but this was the one I could afford. I went with what I knew, even though the gold one I had at first ordered from Bemz was not as bright yellow as I would have liked, as previously mentioned. But on this case, Bemz came through with FLYING COLORS! This case matches the bright color shown on Amazon, and is not a darker red, as I feared it would be! Good job, Bemz!!!  So now I give Bemz a five-star review!!"
Gift for my husband. Perfect fit.
Nice Phone so far.
Everything ok
I love it.
Loved it!
A+++
Couldn't get bubbles out.  Cracked when I tried to lift and re-postion.
Good case
Works well for the cost and value if you don't want to sell your arm for a phone case
"Performs as expected with little-to-no issues.<br /><br />Attaches to car with a 3M adhesive patch. Make sure you are ready to have this on your car for a while.<br /><br />The button controller attaches to the 3M patch with magnets, and is easy to remove and hide.<br /><br />The multi-slot USB charger is a great value in itself."
Excellent battery case.
I had to rebuy and other one. it didn't sound good at all. its cheap but I wasted my money on it. I don't know why I totally forgot I could return them.
Good product
Was nothing like the description.  The strap was extremely long-must be for a six+ person.  Won't be using it.  Very disappointed.
It works
Works great!
Great sheild for the nexus 6. Little hard to put on but they all are. Just be patient and take your time putting it on. Also feels much smoother than the regular glass which is kinda weird.
Always works great.
"DONT BUY IT , it breaks too fast ."
"Well, I started out loving this product.  It charged my phone in warp speed.  Awesome, right?!  Then, the 3rd day I had it, it was plugged in and my phone fell off the counter.  The plug part pulled as it fell since the cord wasn't quite long enough to reach the ground.  Well, the whole thing came apart!  I mean it plug into the phone just kind of disintegrated - it was the weirdest thing ever!  I had to use plyers to get out the last piece of the plug that got stuck in my phone when it came apart.  Very disappointed."
Very good!
Nice
Does not work with a brand new 2015 Chevy Camaro.. Disappointing...
Work just like it was supposed to
Fit my iphone 5s with screen protector just fine. Lasts me my entire 14 hr day at work
I go through a lot of screen protectors. A lot of them because my girl ends up pulling them off or they end up getting scratched going back and forth from here to her Mom on the weekends. So a three pack at this price? Awesome.
Nice phone
Fits perfect
Nice case! works well
Perfect !
Nice
A bit disappointed that the screen protectors do not completely go to the edge of the screen. There's a gap between the screen protector and the edge of the screen and every case I have put on pushes the screen protector back up.
"Excellent product, fits perfectly and the price is right. It came on exactly the date it was expected"
"Pretty amazing GPS.  Very accurate, clear with a huge screen.  My only gripe is that it does not show where the red light cameras are.  That would really help considering we have so many in the NYC area."
"I absolutely love my JOTO! I got it and did the initial test with the paper towel and it passed, and then I brought it to the pool. I took some underwater videos with it, and the videos were crystal clear. My iPod touch (which I used to record) didn't get a drop of water on it. I would recommend this to everyone who wants a good, working case to take underwater photos and videos, or just to bring to the pool or beach so their device doesn't get wet or dirty. I look forward to future use of my JOTO waterproof case!"
2 big 4 my 15 in box
Great
The cover is very nice and sturdy.<br />The clips holds it too snug and it is hard to take it out.
"These earbuds came exactly as advertised. The sound is clear, even at higher volume levels (please do not play music too loud). I have used the microphone sparingly, and there does not seem to be any problems associated with it as well. The only caveat to these is the material does not seem to be as high quality as the ear pods that were originally shipped with my iPhone. However, the price was great nonetheless.<br /><br />If anything does come up during longer use with this product, I hope I can return and add a supplement to this review. The seller far exceeded my expectation of the delivery of these ear pods, and has been easy to work with."
"really good,"
EXCELLENT!!!!!  The price was AMAZING.  I have already recommended this phone to friends and family.  Thank YOU.
"Very good looking case. The swivel belt clip is a real plus, but I'm not certain about its longevity. This is why I've given it a four star rating. It's fitted very well for the Moto E (second gen.) The presence of a very thin shell protector on the back of the phone results in difficulty when placing it in the case and removing it as well. I would recommend against using a shell protector if one is considering this carrying case for a purchase. I know because I tried to use one on my own Moto E and had these very problems.<br /><br />A thoughtful feature on this case is the metal covering over the lower edge of the belt clip. The faux leather covering over the steel spring always wears out first at that edge. This leaves the lower part of the clip exposed and the clip itself usually has sharp edges on it. This has always resulted in needing to replace a case even though the rest of it was still in good shape."
"Bought this for my significant other who is a huge BTTF fan. It is a slim case for the iPhone 6 with grooves for grip which is beneficial since most plastic cases are slippery and cause the phone to slide out of your hand.  The sticker is as displayed in the advert.  The image is a bit grainy and would be better in a higher resolution, and the words on the top and middle of the capacitor have also been covered with a red block which detracts from the original image, but overall it was a good purchase that I am happy with."
Works Great! IPhone 5S connects perfectly and push button shutter release is perfect.
Exactly what I needed. Came as promised.
"so let me explain my delimma. a waterproof, shockproof, dust proof phone case is often, unfortunately, sound proof also. not so good fo ra phone! but i work a lot in a wood shop and am building a tiny house on the weekend, so a bumper type case is just simply not enough. this is THE case. it has a hard inner layer surrounded by a soft layer kind of like an otter defender. but its not as bulky. and its more stylish. Am i the only one who doesnt want my phone to look like my M&M's? then the last piece,of  which three are sent with it , is the back-plate, and it  protects the back of the phone. so, unlike a defender it is EASY to get it in and out of the inner hard layer, and the back plate provides the protection for the back on the outside. its not just decorative. it would be apt to say this is a three part case. and it looks great. a little rugged, but stylish too. not to thick. great protection. there is a hole in the home button so your touch ID works. the ports are covered with soft plastic covers so things cant get in there. and call quality is fine, its the first thing we tested. highly recommend.  Update. I've dropped my phone numerous NUMEROUS times with this case on. I've actually broken the case in fact, but my phone is fine. And I'm a tall guy, I'm 6' 2&#34;. I've dropped it standing, tried to catch it, and knocked it across the room into concrete floors. And the phone is fine. Love it. ;)"
works really well
Great for the price :-)
"Thay are great sounds great performs awsome, I recamend them to anyone"
Well Working
DOESNT WORK AT ALL! I ordered this for my iPod shuffle as the other cord is on its last leg - this wouldn't charge when plugged into the wall and wouldn't connect OR charge when plugged into my computer. DO NO PURCHASE THIS!
It very good thanks
It's really cool .
It protected my phone and also look goods .
"I have nine grandkids, ranging in ages from 1 to 10 yrs. I have anywhere from 3 to 5 visit for a sleep over at least once a month, plus other visits. I needed something charge all the tablets and phones...this is perfect. I have color-coded USB cables so every one knows who's is whose."
The metal back on it interferes with the signal!! :(
Not strong enough for me
Perfect fit and finish simplified a dreaded install
"Great Product to have in your car to power or charge laptop, tablet & phones."
"First day and so far I'm loving this.  I watched the video, read the directions and had no problem installing it.  The screen looks clear and perfect."
"After reading all of the reviews and having an approximate 94% approval rating, I was totally hyped up to check these out. when I get them and opened them up, I was a little put off. They do look cool, but they are completely made out of plastic. They feel very, very cheap, solid, but cheap. There was no charge on them at all. Typically, there is a partial charge or at least enough to power them on. No problem, I took the supplied cable and charged them for 2 hours. I saw the red light lit indicating a charge, and then the blinking blue light indicating a full charge. I put them in my ears and I was unable to power them on. I wasn't sure what was going on. I plugged them back into power and then was able to turn them on. I put them in pairing mode and started playing music. The sound was very good and they had a good fit. I continued to let them charge for another two hours and after that I was still unable to turn them on without being plugged into a charger. I am very pleased with the replacement / return process. Maybe I got some out of a bad lot or something. I am not sure what happened. With all of these positive reviews, I am very disappointed in what I ended up getting."
great~~
"shipped with europen plug, but bought adapter and the pack works great for my laptop"
I have several of these working in my home now. They all work flawlessly and [with IFTTT] have limitless possibilities for programming. Looking forward to adding more as time and $$$ permit.
"[[VIDEOID:e8181b266aea9bc5006b93fba5078b2c]] This is a great little speaker. It has a rubber casing to protect it from bumps because you will be taking this on the go. There is an included carabeaner clip to attach take it wherever you go: to the park, to school,  to the beach. Included with the speaker is a micro USB charging cable and a 3.5 mm audio cable if you aren't using bluetooth. On the back is a rubber covering protecting ports to charge, 3.5 audio port, and the on/off switch) The top has clear buttons to pair the device, play/pause/answer calls, Volume Up/down/skip song forward/back. Whats neat is that this also included an LED flashlight. I can see myself taking this camping just to do double duty.<br /><br />Sound wise it gets loud and clear with crisp highs but not much in the way of a lower range. I don't expect that from a speaker of this size but its worth noting. Bluetooth range is typical for a device like this at about 30 feet in open air. Full disclosure the seller provided me with this to review. If you have any questions please leave a comment.<br /><br />Amazon Disclosure Statement:<br />-I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review; or<br />-I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.<br />Why the statement?

it doethe job
Extremely cheap. Doesnt stay on the phone. Design is great though.
Awesome case perfect for that phone. Thanks.
"We can charge all our devices at once. No more arguing over who gets to charge. Great color. Plug folds down for travel. WHen plugged into wall, doesn't block the 2nd outlet. Very pleased with purchase."
"Flimsy junk don't waste your money, they say they fit the 1999 vw but they don't, I actually found some localy and when I compared them they were not even close."
Nice!!
Worked great
"Nice case, fits the iPhone 6 with Spigen Slim Armor Case perfectly."
Good!
Easy to apply. Item as described
I'm not a big fan of this case. When I make calls no one can hear me. I have to always have my headphones in and it's just annoying that I don't even use the case anymore.
"For the price you can not really bet it, but you get what you pay for. It is kind of tricky to get the watch on it to start charging."
"This case DOES NOT fit a IPHONE 5C, I recently purchased it for my daughter and was extremely upset once I received it. The case is too small. The seller clearly states in the item description that it fits an &#34;IPHONE 5C&#34;...not worth the purchase, time to return and dispute #OVERIT!!"
Our son likes to throw the phone on the floor<br />Its completely safe with this case!!!!
Great case good quality
Great
Really nice mouse for the price. you can also adjust the pointer speed. fits nice in the palm smooth on a lot of surfaces
"I really like this case. Originally when I first ordered it, I was simply buying a case just to protect my phone. But now I'm super happy with it because not only does it protect my phone, but it also looks really cool, and doesn't make my phone bulky like other cases. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it; people think it's one of those &#34;life proof&#34; cases. Also, I like the the little stand that's built in to the back of the case. I recommend this product."
I hate it because it didn't come with a plug in cord.  So  now I have to buy a separate cord.  I should NOT  have bought this item because of that.
"Very, very disappointed. Since the beginning having problems with the door you use to charge thei cel. Hard time to keep it close and now it does not close. Looking forward to get my money back."
"So, I had to get a replacement transmitter becuase the first one did not cooperate. But I send JETech a email stating that the transmitter didnt work and I wanted a refund. They offered to send me a replacement, once I got the replacement and connected it to my radio, IT WORKED! An amazing product, barely any static, just have to find a great signal on an fm station. BUY IT!!!!!"
"The product is functions very well as a charger. The LED indicator remains blue for any device that is not Quick Change 2 compliant and turns green if it is a Quick Change compliant device (operating at a higher voltage than the traditional 5v in USB devices). I like this ability as not many charger have it.  The only complaint I have is that the plastic opening surrounding the port is very small and tight. In fact, when I first got the device my USB cables would not even go in. I have to really force them in gently by wedging the connector in to carefully expanded the size of the plastic opening to the port. I don't know if this is just my unit or just typical of this model. The USB port is still a bit inconvenient to use and take more effort that what should be to plug in a USB connector.  Most Anker products are exceptional, I hope this is just a fluke.  Edit (9/7/15): The Anker Staff has since gotten in touch with me and offered me a replacement. The replacement just arrived and works perfectly! There are no longer any problems fitting the USB plug into the charger. It's understandable that once in a while things get passed quality control, but Anker's excellent customer care fixed the problem quickly without much effort on my part."
GOOD PURCHASE
6 days of battery life with my Note 4. Need I say more?
My wife loves it. Helps keep it of the counter and saves space since you can place items closer to it without worrying about getting burned.
"This case is so awesome.  Looks very professional, feels great in hand."
It stopped working a week after unpacking this cable. Terrible quality. Didn't expect this from Tech Armor
"Price ='s quality!  NOT saying it's cheaply made.  It's of equal value and super fun, cute and easy to install on my phone."
"I love the phone except it doesn't have UBER app functionality as of  August 31, 2015. (I tried the mobile web version, but it doesn't work.  Error message says to download the app.)  Hopefully this comes soon, but for now I'm stranded.  I will update my review as soon as I find a solution.  I might be close.  I tried using the mobile website recently and it might be working.  I will verify as soon as possible (9/4/2015)  To research this issue, search for mobilityarena article uber-app-for-android-not-working-any-more-on-bb10."
"The sound is great on my iPhone 4s. But every time I make a whatsapp call, Viber or any other free calls I have to turn it OFF AND ON to hear through  the Bluetooth  when I get a regular call. And sometime the Bluetooth will  disconnect by it self"
I absolutely love this case. Very durable like an otterbox but without the plastic screen cover.
Was delivered as promised and received what I expected. I can't ask for anything more.
beautiful
excellent charger
Works as described. I use it around the house and not actually while travel. My battery pack that plugs directly in the wall and has built-in cable is better suited for travel.
"Weighs a little more than I expected & isn't as compact.  However, it holds a charge & does the trick. Nice to have away from any other way to charge things."
"Read the reviews and ordered two of these 6'ers. I really wanted a 10', but it sounds as though the phone end of the plug is different on it than the 6' and would be too big to fit my Lifeproof case. That being said, everything has worked flawlessly on these two."
"We bought them to use with our new RV we needed them for directions in backing up, and my husband and I use them with the headset to talk to each other when riding in the RV, he can not hear me talking to him so they help us to communicate as he is driving."
"Fit my 2006 Toyota Prius key perfectly and, since it's lime green, it stands out from our other car keys."
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
It works fine and the iPhone doesn't show any incompatibility message.
"This item worked great for two weeks.  I was hoping Monet was a good brand after I saw similar adapters were duds.  After two weeks, it died. It took me a while to write the review as I don't drive the Acura that much. Much promise...greater disappointment I bought another unit hoping I receive a defective unit.  The second unit failed within 10 days."
"Easy to place, very clear, no problems yet, will buy again!"
Love it
"Love it, and it's easy to use."
"Nice item. Charging the phone is a little annoying, have to take plug out of bottom and the charger doesn't go in all the way."
for my neighbor. she said it fits fine. and it a good color.
Very very very good quality and make the device looks much more premium.<br />It was just one issue that the package it was broken but the case it self it was ok
"It has been almost a month since I started using them. At first they worked well, but now the sign that says &#34;this device is not compatible with your device comes up often&#34; and sometimes I have to move the wire around several times in order for it to start charging."
"The Rankie cords are the perfect replacement for the the original product received with my pc tablet and smart phone.  My foster puppy has chewed through every cord while the devices are being used or charged. After a few bad purchases, I finally got what I needed.<br /><br />I mistakenly purchased similar cords from another vendor and although they seemed to be made well, the thickness of the cord made it stiff.  It affected the connectivity in a negative way as the cord could not bend at the connection point for consistent contact. Nothing worse than to find the tablet had no juice hours later.  This happened all the time and so irritatingly inconvenient.  Also, I mistakenly ordered the wrong length of cord and that vendor would not allow a return for exchange...and that item cost more than these.<br /><br />Rankie customer service offers service AND replacement or exchange!  The connection point on my devices are not damaged by a poor fit by a unbending cord also.  Why didn't I find these cords first!"
Purchased this for my daughter.  She is very happy with product
BUY NOW !!
"I traveled overseas to Thailand, and this helped out tremendously on 8 hour tours of the city."
Perfect fit.
"This charger ROCKS!!! It charges multiple phones faster them my car or wall charger. My husband and spent all day riding a motorcycle, and thanks to this devise, my LG3, his I phone 5 and Samsung (3 phones) were fully charged as we were taking million of pictures.<br />Also being a mom of 2, I am terrified that my phone might die while I am at the store, or can not charge it. Now I have this charges in my purse and no longer worry that my kids or their school wont be able to get a hold of me.<br />Its pretty compact and sturdy.<br />Thinking about buying one for my hubby as he started borrowing mine quite often..."
"very nice clear picture. A bit difficult to run the wires, but camera works well on my 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited"
Worked just fine and the price was affordable...
All cables stopped charging my phones after short use.
"Great product, packaging is on point and includes lots of extras to install it."
Ok screen protector.  Had a hard time getting the bubbles out.
Good
"Every time I attempt to use the wall charger, a printed message on my Garmin Nuvi says &#34;The connected cable is not compatible with traffic for this device. Traffic service is disabled. Connect the correct power cable to receive traffic service.&#34;<br />I am not sure whether the device actually can charge the Garmin, since the Garmin is new, and the battery is currently fully charged. Gomadic/Amazon refunded my money, and Gomadic did not want me to return the charger. Everyone has been cooperative."
Everything oke
For what your paying its worth it but the cross does start de-coloring about after a week. other than that it is really pretty!
very satisfied with this case.
Horrible
"I love this case so much. It's wonderful, but it's slightly cheaply made. The printing doesn't line up on it very well, but regardless I love it. The shape hugs the frame and its so adorable. I've gotten a lot of laughs and compliments from it. Thank you! :)"
Happy with this purchase.
great product
"Works great! Never had a problem of the suction mount loosening or coming loose, even in direct sunlight! Will hold an IPAD Air 2 but you will need to put it in a case or use foam to fill the empty space."
works perfect
"I found the case I wanted at the price I was willing to pay. Then came choosing the design, which in itself was kinda fun. When I saw the design I chose, it was immediately recognizable as the correct choice for me. When I saw the name of it, &#34;Owl&#34;, that was instantly recognizable as incorrect. I is a CAT. When I opened it, it was apparent it is no ordinary cat, but the CHESHIRE CAT. I love it and have gotten more &#34;Where'd you get that? It's so cool!&#34; comments about it than anything else I own."
Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
"Fit perfectly, feels good."
fit perfectly & very sturdy...i drop my phone a lot & no cracks
"These ear buds can connect with two cellphones OR two tablets at the same time.  That's pretty cool.  Usually if one of my kids is using one of the blue tooth speakers I can't listen to it in my ear buds.  (Although it's the same music they are listening to, I like to listen with ear buds so I can tune out everything else.)  I tried these out over the weekend and they worked great.  I was able to listen to the music in my earbuds while my son had it playing softly for him to do homework.  I have not tried it with two cellphones yet but I am anxious to do so.  Charges fast and has good battery life.  They are also sweat proof.  I LOVE that feature!  I live in the south and the heat and humidity are miserable.  I have ruined a couple of pair of ear buds because of sweat.  My husband used these while mowing (and sweating profusely).  There was no problem with the sound, connection, controls, incoming calls, etc...  The sweat didn't affect them.  They sync up easily, the sound quality is great and they are comfortable to wear.  No complaints here.  Sample provided for testing, evaluation and review."
Thin and not what was described.
"I love it!!!! I can carry my credit cards, money and cell phone all in one wallet. It is so convenient!!! I don't carry my purse as much because this is less of a hassel. Very good purchase for the price! I recommend this wallet to everyone with a cell phone. The wallet is good for a man or women. You will love it!"
Effective but a little pricy.
it is what I expected
Doesn't fit my phone properly...a tad too small.
I love it and it fits my phone perfectly.
My GPS can't fit in it if connected to the power.
Perfect!
Loved the fit & color
works
"Bought to replace a disappointing battery from RayOVac/Batteries Plus which was not lasting a day.  Went to them after none of the $5 motorola batts sold online that I tried were out of date and wouldn't hold up.  This battery is lasting through the day with about a 50% drain, which is good for an old droid x.  The battery did fit in without a modified cover, but it was tight and I had to pressure the door a bit to get it to close."
It's marvel comics not DC comics.
great
"As soon as I put it on, my phone feels protected while looking stylish. The buttons are a little hard to press but you'll get used to it. Loved that this was only 9$. And yes people it does protect the protruding camera. I feel my phone is better protected now because of this case and I have a tempered glass screen on it. Awesome :). I got mine in blue"
Battery arrived in good shape
great one i like it
Holding up very well.
Awesome product!!!!
Received sooner than expected and the product was good quality. Highly recommend
Case was warped and wouldn't stay on the phone
"Love it! But to be honest, I thought it was counterfit at first because of the package. How wrong was I, I'm writing my review on it."
Very useful especial when I and my hubby need charge smartphones at the same time in the car
"Arrived on time, no issues, well wrapped, Very Happy."
Good product
The screw fell out of bad when it was on wrist and amost lost apple watch. The bad also does not fit in locking  mechanism easy have to force it
Best case on the market. Fits perfect:)
Great phone
Great item
"Go-to, inexpensive mp3 player for my workouts. I'm on my 3rd one (have been wearing them out for about 8 years). The clips eventually break or the headphone jack gets messed up (causing the sound goes out in one ear), but I'm talking after a couple of years of very heavy use/abuse.<br />---PROS:<br />-Inexpensive<br />-Clips onto clothes for hands-free use<br />-Comes with COBY earbuds (I have trouble using any other kind due to an inner ear piercing)<br />-Comes with USB converter that you use to charge the battery and upload music from your computer (I charge it using my computer)<br />-Battery life is at least a few hours/several days of working out<br />-Has a shuffle/random setting, hold button, pause button, fast forward skip, and rewind/backwards skip buttons as well as volume adjustment<br /><br />---CONS<br />-No screen<br />-No folder/playlist options (unless you have shuffle on, songs will play in the order you uploaded them)<br />-The last one I purchased didn't have as strong a clip as previous ones (slides off my shirt if I'm running strenuously). This could just be a fluke, since I've never had this problem before with previous ones.<br />-Sometimes I wish it would turn up louder. Some of my music files are on the quiet side so if I'm near traffic I can't hear them as well as I'd like to- however, this could be a headphone problem. Most of the time, it is plenty loud.<br /><br />Love this product because I can listen to music while working out and not have to carry it. I don't have to worry about it breaking or falling, because it is so inexpensive to replace. It's very small and practically weightless. Uploading music is simple- think dragging mp3 files onto a thumb F: drive. Charges quickly and holds battery life long enough. I also purchased a USB wall outlet for super cheap so I can charge it when I'm not around my computer. Overall, a great bargain for the price if you're looking for a lightweight, no-frills shuffle mp3 player!"
Was delivered when promised. Great product
Great replacement battery.  I purchased two of these.  I always place the date I purchased them.  The price was good and the delivery was on time.
Nice throw away item.
"The protector is bigger and the corners have a different shape than the phone. This causes the screen never to adhere right. And because it is actually glass, you can't cut it.<br /><br />I got the usual seller email with &#34;we want you to be 100% satisfied, contact us if you have any issue&#34;, so I wrote then and explained the problem. Their answer was in line with &#34;pics or didn't happen&#34; because it seems that I'm too stupid to write a good explanation or a thief that lies to get $7 back...<br /><br />Just don't buy this..."
Love so far. 1st impression was great really cute
"The iPhone came defective. The Wi-Fi adapter is not working, so I tried to contact Apple but they could not help. This was a bd gift for a relative but when the day of the bd came and the iPhone was opened it was already too late for a return or refund. The iPhone was returned to me and well, the seller deserves less than one start for messing up a special birthday present."
"Loved it!! Was as pictured n described! Arrived on a Sunday, was a huge surprise that it arrived so soon!!! It is perfect!!!"
"Everything is good except that the Glass doesn't lay flat all the way, leaving some air pocket at the edge. It doesn't matter too much because it's in the edge of the screen."
Compact and does the job.
"truthfully, I would love to give this case a good rating, but i just can not. It looks nice and feels good in your hand. The case does not seal all the way around the bottom portion of the phone. also, the camera lens is hard to clean. I did the waterproof test without the phone in it and it was successful. With the phone in it, it was in water for about 10 seconds before i could see water entering near the charger port. I have had two life proofs not and they are not worth even 1/3 of their cost."
I love it!
All right
Great!
These are great for the price if you ONLY want to charge your device. They did not work for data transfer.
"I ordered this along with the 8400 model and the 24 watt wall charger.  I wanted it for power outages as well as travel.  The products arrived on time and with all the goods included. This unit came 75% charged but charged to 100% within a couple of hours.  Instructions were easy to understand and carry out.  I will keep this one at home and use the 8400 for traveling.  Both units have a sturdy, qualitative feel to them - like all parts fit like they should, with good quality materials.  I do not anticipate any issues with this unit."
Very good
Very cute and functional.
GRRRRRRRREAT
Get what you pay for
"I bought this phone about a year and a half ago and am very pleased with it. It's a very sturdy phone and has withstood countless falls without a case, including falls on asphalt and down a hill. When it drops the back cover of the phone comes off and the battery falls out, but I simply put the battery back in and clip the back on. The screen has never even cracked. It continues to work like always; I don't even worry when I drop my phone without it's case anymore. Also, I brought it kayaking with me once and stuck it in the waterproof compartment, but it got a little wet anyhow. When I opened the phone the inside was quite wet, so I quickly took out the battery, dried it off, blew in the cracks, and set it in front of a fan. It was fine!<br />  Besides durability, this phone is very good looking, especially in white. The white shows dirt faster, but this is very easy to remedy, just unclip the back of the phone and wash it with soap and warm water. DO NOT get the battery or phone wet! This phone can't have many apps at once, maybe five, depending how big they are. But it has a removable mini SD card, which is very nice. And it works well for Bluetooth, texting, talking, WiFi, and everything you'll need on a phone. The camera is pretty good too. Plus It's relatively inexpensive. VERY nice phone. I love this phone ! !"
"Beautiful....but the camera  has stopped working. I tried several  ways to see if it would work, but without success."
great product
Look great but it easily gets scratch.
like it
I thought this case was an extra battery plus provided doe protection. Nope I dropped my phone an it cracked. Plus I'm charging the case way too much. Mophie doesn't deserve even a 1 star.
"Best case ever. Had an Otter case for my previous phone and I hated it. This one is protective, light weight and easy to put on and take off. And as usually the price on Amazon was much lower than the phone company's price."
"Now I don't come across a lot of cases for the LG G4 phone but when I do I test them. This is a nicely made case and looks great on the phone. The case is actually 3 pieces, a top and middle layer and a hard plastic bottom layer. I feel that when you have multiple layers it actually provides more protection as they are able to absorb more of the shock. They also usually break apart but if nicely made like this case the pieces snap back together leaving your phone safe and the case easily put back together. I love cases that have a kickstand, after all these phones are becoming more and more for the younger age groups and they use phones to watch videos and play games. So if you are constantly dropping your phone or just want to play it safe make sure to pick this case from Joto up, for the price you can't go wrong.<br /><br />I did receive this phone cases from Joto at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review."
It looks great
Fits controllers well
"Ordered this for my husband so he can keep up with his phone while at the gym so he doesn't have to worry about loosing his phone or gym card.  He has only  used it once, but said so far he really likes it and it's comfortable."
"Works great, save me many plugs. Been using it several months, taking it to trips and people were amazed on how many slots I had. No problem so far, and based on reviews I bought 2 ahead of time, and they are both still good."
Durable. Color is not as vibrant as the picture appears.
NOT VERY QUICK RESPONDING. BATTERY LIFE IS BAD AND CALLS SOUND BAD HAD TO RETURN THE PHONE.
Works with Windows 10
This was purchased for my teenage son. It fits his I phone 5S very well and is very durable.
I received this battery at no cost for a review but this review will reflect my honest opinion. The battery feels reasonably sturdy and heavy in the hand but not bulky. Having 2 ports to charge with is great and the 2.1 amp port charges really fast. The led flashlight is not that bright but will work in a pinch in a dark area. One thing I wish it had was top usb ports instead of side mount ports. If you were to drop it in a bag you won't be able to charge from a tight compartment because of the side usb ports. These are really trivial things and I don't feel I should knock off a star for it. I would recommend this for a person looking for a week end of charging 2 devices but not much more than that.
"You get what you pay for. These can't be as good as Bose or perhaps a few other much more expensive choices, but for the roughly $100 price range they offer great value and quality. Meanwhile, if you have a larger head, these might be not as comfortable. Finally, they don't seem to isolate up to 94% or so of background noise as claimed, but still, they are good and worth the $100."
This case was cracked when it come thru the mail
great
"Sound quality microphone qaulity comfort and battery are all 4 star! I use this with my iPhone 6, the Bluetooth button won't pick up a call or end a call and with blue tooth connected my phone delays picking up the call. Maybe better with a different phone not happy with it on my iphone"
"Very, very stylish looking case. This Vegan/Napa &#34;leather&#34; is really &#34;pleather&#34;/fake leather (vinyl)-- but looks VERY real.  It is the &#34;grippiest&#34; leather I have ever owned--VERY easy to hold onto the back! The sides are a tiny bit slippery though. Everything is well made and fits beautifully. The bezel has a decent &#34;lip&#34; to protect the screen. It provides about 'medium' (maybe hip level) drop protection--which is good considering how slim and refined it looks--it actually improves the look of the phone.  OH, the red is a darker red than the picture.  It is couple shades darker  (kinda 'brick red'.)  I paid $24.99 for it on sale.  I would have paid $35 for it. Not sure about $45.  But it looks really nice. **UPDATE To fix the slippery sides I put a 1/4&#34; strip of this gun/tool grip tape on each side.  It actually looks kinda like leather. amazon sells it: &#34;GT-5000 Grip Tape for guns, cell phones, cameras, knives, tools - makes anything &#34;Grippy&#34; 6 Strips&#34;"
I've previously purchased head case design products and I have not been disappointed until I received this particular case. When I put it on the dimensions were off and it barely fit over my phone. I loved the design but did not meet up with my expectations.
I bought them in every color. They are great and look just like the apple band. Would love other colors too!!!
"Very cute, bigger then I expected but so cute on my phone."
"decent for the price.  I wouldn't say this is going to prevent a break if dropped from waist level on concrete, but its about what I expected.  I wanted something thin and with a bit of elasticity and this fit the bill."
Don't buy this - Power and volume buttons will not work with the case on the phone.
Love it and it hasn't even come yet
Works perfectly and arrived earlier than I expected. Highly recommend!
it's great!
Clear instructions were provided.  Great packaging and complete with all that you need for a perfect/professional installation.  I strongly suggest that you invest 5 minutes and review the installation video  ( link on packaging).  Note the tempered glass protectors are much easier to install and protect far better than the film protectors.
"I went for this glass cover because the image shows a cutout that covers more real estate on the Note 5 than the others.  See the photos attached, so disappointed in them.<br /><br />I saved a photo of the product image just in case it gets changed somehow as well.<br /><br />It's a SOLID piece of glass let me tell you, so I gave it 2 stars instead of one, but you need to know what you are getting.<br /><br />Update:  My wife noticed on 9/3/15 that the pic has been changed to reflect the actual product shipped.  Good for them to update it.<br /><br />Overall I enjoy the glass on my note 5 it's thick and applied great.  Thanks!"
Good looking case
great!
Awesome
I can't recommend this product highly enough! A problem with the Note 4 is that it uses way too much battery power so you have to have a charger within reach. This product ends all your battery worries while simultaneously taking care of your need for a protective case.
Hard to install collected lint. And the other ones got stuck to the paper. What a waste
"Got this as a present for my mom and she loves it! The soft rubber lining cushions the ipod while the hard case protects it from damage. It does not cover the screen but stays securely in place around the front border. Mine is different and only soft rubber and it slips off all the time. My next one will be just like this one! The color and print are still intact 3 months later. The holes line up perfectly with the usb port, ear bud port etc... It covers the volume buttons on the side with soft rubber so you can still easily press them without getting dirt in them. Overall its great! Mom did say it took a little work to put it on the ipod but she got it just fine. Great, cheap, pretty, durable ipod case!"
"great product, durable"
"nice look but 2 days after getting the case, it had dropped on the ground and broke. if you are a clumsy person i do not recommend getting this case it is not durably made at all"
"It'd be nice to be able to activate voice commands from this device, but overall the product works as intended."
Very good
Great protection! Make sure you get a case that protects the screen edges. I wish I knew that prior to purchase.
"I am so disappointed, I must say that it was the easiest protector to that I have ever put on but I noticed right that it seemed to cause a cloudy look to the phones display. I had hoped that it would clear within a couple of days but unfortunately I found that the screen itself just never adhered properly to the device, it came off today, no drops no new case applied, just felt loose and then came off."
Bought this for work cell and love it...
It charges! It also mows my lawn.
Fast delivery and great quality product!
"This cell phone holder is super east to use! It comes with 2 magnets stickers for your phone. I stuck it to the back of my phone under the case, but next time I would stick it to the inside of the case. This is much more user friendly than the kind that you have to adjust brackets to fit your phone, all you have to do is set it on the base and it sticks. I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review, but I would definitely pay full price for this product."
"As a person that doesn't leave home without my Fitbit on my wrist, I don't think I could ever have enough bands for my Fitbit Flex.<br /><br />This is the second set of replacement bands that I have from this same company and I love them! These are plain colored bands, but they still look very nice and come in a variety of shades.  I find them comfy to wear, but I will say they run slightly smaller than the original bands that come with the Flex.<br /><br />I like that these close tightly, and feel very secure when I have them on. Even though they close tightly, I still I always make sure to add a clasp fastener for extra security and definitely recommend doing that. The Flex is a pricey little gadget and I like having all the extra security against losing it that I can get.<br /><br />I love being able to just grab whatever one suits my outfit or my mood and head out the door. I received some to review, and I can honestly say that I love them and wear these every single day."
Best case for note 4
Sound great!! Perfect for my car system!!
great
"These come pre-impreganated with dust. Once installed, the cover shimmers rainbow colors. I opted to leave my screen unprotected rather than use these. If these were condoms, then I'd have dozens of children by now."
"So far, working great! I didn't want to spend a lot on a charger...and I didn't have to!"
Is very good
Not what I expected
Works great Love The belt loop. I work in crawl spaces don't loose My phone. AAA
Works great and isn't intrusive at all. I love it.
"Cheap plastic, not very sturdy. Pin came out of clip after first week of use and fell off of belt. Don't waste your time or money buying this holder"
This is the second phone I've purchased a Ballistic case for and they are great.
Great
The product itself is exactly as it's advertised. It has a leather look and to be sincere it looks like a wallet from afar. The issue I had is that the card will eventually scratch the phone if it does not have a screen protector. Late thinking on my side. Other than that the product is good to Cary essentials in a quick and easy manner.
Does not have the cut out to remove the s pen which is displayed in the picture and description
"I bought my glass screen protector, amd it is really disappointing. I don't do things that are particularly hard on phones, just normal adult use and my first one cracked within weeks. I got a replacement for the $5.99 shipping charge, and within weeks, it is cracked in multiple places again. The phone is never without a case either for protection from falls and such. The only conclusion I can draw is the protector itself is flawed in some way"
Thank you..
Love it!
"Just received my Skiva lightning cable and LOVE IT! It is made of a nice sturdy material, not the rubbery kind that usually falls apart quickly. It charged my phone quick and is a nice length. I don't have amazon prime and it was shipped extremely quickly. It even comes with a 1 year warranty."
"Works great. I read a ton of reviews before purchasing. Stays in place. I've been super sweaty hiking in Arizona in the summer, doesn't budget. Phone is protected and has never come out of the casing wet. Like the other reviews say, a very thin case can fit inside. I have Galaxy 6 Ringke Slim case and it fits right in. I wear the armband usually about 4 times a week, hiking, lifting weights, doing stadiums, works well in every situation. My 1 complaint is that the little piece at the end of the arm strap, that weaves through so you can adjust the armband to your arm, is peeling back. The material has separated from the foamy armband, but just at that very end. Hopefully it won't keep peeling back and just stays right there at the end.  Had this since the end of May 2015."
"Fast delivery , as described nice case"
Works great<br />No issues
Excellent for the lake! And the kids love it! For its price it's a great buy!
"Took a minute to get used to it, but it works very well.  I have played three rounds since it has arrived.  Shot 89 and 82 respectively.  Very accurate and it has seems to have all of my local clubs downloaded.  Would make a great gift for the avid golfer."
"WAS not colorful enough and since it came from China,cannot send it back"
"They are very small and even with the extensions, it's very hard to fit them in my head."
Well my daughter like this
"I've had many screen protectors over the years. The is the best I've ever had on a phone. It feels like the screen of the iPhone, it is super sensitive, it makes the screen look spectacular! It was super easy to attach to the screen with out one air bubble. Look no further than this one."
"bought this as part of my husbands birthday gift and it arrived on time, product is great...you can change colors to match with your clothes."
"The wire became lose within a month of having it. Not bent or broke, lose from the part that plugs in."
Love this wireless charge for the phone. And works nice and fits great.
Awesome product
"These screen protectors are really good for protecting my two Moto G phones that I've bought three weeks ago and are still doing a good job as I speak.When I first tried to apply them to my two phones they not that hard to get on the screens after I thoroughly read the instructions that they came with placing the screen protectors on were pretty straight forward.The pack of these amFilm Moto G screen protectors for the 1st Gen Moto G phone came with three screen protectors,three rubber bands,a dust remover stickers for cleaning off the dust on the adhesive side of the screen protectors and a card for getting the air bubbles out.Speaking of air bubbles that part of the installation to these amFilm screen protectors didn't stick all the way through to the point where I could not see any more bubbles on the screen to my Moto G phones.I mean I did use the card to remove the air bubbles as much as I can but I still noticed a little but it wasn't all bad even though the cut out line isn't entirely fitting the Moto Gs but that ok I thought I would just go along with getting these screen protectors any way since I was in need of good ones like the kind that has special features to them like HD or Anti-glare being added to the phone's screen which would enhance them for a better look and feel and that is why I bought these to give a extra HD look to my two Moto G phones and I really like them for that.Later if I happen to come across anything better than these screen protectors then I'll most likely get those after I do some research on them."
Shipping time was fast...phone was just what i was looking for.
My problem is the battery..it gets easily dead.
"Great sound , about 3 hr battery life before needing recharge"
Best case for Samsung phones! Amazingly low price and great quality.
"It was too big for my Sony Walkman to fit in it, item didn't match description"
"I use this all the time, works great."
Just received mine.  Took about 3 minutes to set up.  It works perfectly with my Xperia Z3.  I'll use it more as a method to receive notifications vs. as an activity tracker.  So far it's been perfect.  No more missed calls or text!
Works great.
"I love it! It arrived quickly, earlier than expected, fits perfect and no problems after one month of use."
"I have the note 5 and doea not cover the screen at all. I took it to Verizon because  I'm really bad to apply screens and it didn't do much better, they advise to return.<br /> Very disappointing actually waste of money<br /><br />Will be returning it."
"These are honestly cheaper elsewhere with free shipping. We chose to buy these ones (I bought 3 different colors) because they looked like deeper colors, not so bright neon. Unfortunately that's just the picture used. They are just as bright neon as most, somewhat disappointing. The covers fit great, shipping was a little slower than most."
Very good cover. Protects my phone well
As expected!
"Its the best i Ever had. I had broke the first one, and i ordered another one. Dropped my phone on the floor twice ,and the glass did not shatter."
Good case. Good material
Love the way it looks but it started peeling the first week I had it. 😕
Item was too bulky.
"[[VIDEOID:14bcffebd6a45821a64d9f5b8a682de3]] This EMIE Memo External Battery 8000mAh with Wake on Shake is a pretty neat little battery. Its very slim  and comes in a few cool colors. Its packaged well too. It is an 8000mAh battery so it should charge your smart phone roughly a couple of times before needing juice back in it. Most phones have a 2000 to 2500 mAh battery.  It does have smart charging so it wont over charge your device. Your device tells it what it needs and this guy sends that to the device. You can plug it in and forget it..it will do its thing and do it safely.<br /><br />You do give it a shake to get the battery indicator to come on. Neat..but not necessary. It does have an LED light on it that lights up when its charging or being used. Here is my indifference..There 3 indicator lights on here to show you how much juice is left in this battery. The book says green is 0 to 30% ,blue is 30 to 70%, and red is 70 to 100%<br /><br />Here is my problem with that. Green is LOW? Red Is good? And 30 to 70% ....thats a huge jump to me ...30% means I need to charge this..70% means I'm still good. So what is it..good or no? So those 2 things really didnt impress me.<br /><br />Hey guys it does what it is advertised to do..it looks cool, its slim and it's got that shake to wake thing going on. The battery indicator thing really bugs me though. I am giving this EMIE Memo External Battery 8000mAh with Wake on Shake 4 stars for those reasons.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br />I received a sample product to test and evaluate. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review."
Easy and fast to connect to my iphone 6. On my phone it tells me how much battery is left on the headphones which is a nice feature. Two gripes are that the batter does only last about 6-8 hours depending on how much you use the buttons on it - and there is no carrying pouch/case to protect them. Great for running or at the gym with no wires. Would recommend to buy.
these were better than I expected and have proven very reliable I would buy this item again
Works great!
"Beautiful case.  Did not think the pen would be helpful,  but my husband finds it much easier than trying to get his big fingers on the right place.  He has some small motor control issues,  so this had really been a help!"
I have anger issues and i hate smart phones period. I get mad cause texting i can't tell what button im hitting so i throw my phone alot. Already been threw 4 screans. So this case pops off really easy and well yup screen #4 case didnt do s***.
Very useful and economical way to convert the existing micro USB connectors to lightning connectors. Working flawlessly so far.
Great product for the price!!
"I was skeptical when I ordered this, but I found that it was easy to assemble and works well.  The magnet for the nfc switch works well and  the lenses that are included worked fine for me.  The phone is held in place by a rubber band and its held very securely.  The head band holds it into place nicely without being to tight for my average size head.  This is a nice way to try out VR and this technology will only get better, my kids were amazed at how they could look all around and interact with things in some programs.  There are many programs to chose from in the google play store and apple store to try.  I recommend it."
Works great. No problems at all. Very sturdy design. I would give it 5 if they expand their designs. I don't love the design but it was the best of the options.
"[[VIDEOID:56cad5d204e99f886c1ff956caa5204a]]HiFi for just a small size, when i received this Bluetooth speaker. i am already expecting that ill will just be like a phone when i play music because its too small fits my palm honestly although i am much impressed on packaging seller definitely got style. as soon i connected Bluetooth on my LG phone and start playing music darn what a HiFi, the bass and treble of music is great, I am surprised.I tried it on Micro SD card and it works too. with the small size i can bring this on parks to play music, pocket size so i can keep it on my pocket too. battery life is around 8 hrs of continuous playing, i did test that because i hook it up on my phone playing lullaby music for my toddler next room. good Bluetooth range, i don't need to get up to bed and change the lullabies song.<br />Easy to connect on Bluetooth, once your phone Bluetooth is ON just turn on the Bluetooth speaker, i am sure you will hear a Bluetooth ON\\"" then pair your device. Once paired you can start playing music.  Highly Recommended<br /><br />I received Bluetooth Wireless Portable Speaker by Argon technologies for FREE in exchange of my unbiased and honest own opinion review."
"Excellent for adding Sirius to our motorcycle! Love, love, love it. Worked perfect for what we needed."
great product.
The worst wasn't even the case I wanted it was a Fake imitation case of Kate spade and was very  piss about it
"I love this iPhone 6 case! I get many compliments on the periwinkle color, too!!"
great buy super fast shipping a+++
Nice ribbon-like lanyards in an assortment of pretty colors.  Fun to coordinate the lanyards to match my daily outfits :)
Works fine.
Great product!!
"Great screen protection, very easy to apply. Just make sure you don't touch the sticky side with your fingers might leave a bit of a print. Touch sensitivity goes from 10/10 to 9/10 But nothing thats really bottersome. Screen smoothenes 10/10, and look 9.5/10. Great buy would definitely buy it again! !"
Great
Very secure and protective for my Galaxy s5 active. Clip works great and a belt loop when more security is needed.
I gave this selfie stick as a gift. The person I gave it to really likes it and is happy with it and the quality.
Awesome
I absolutely love this case!! Shows your whole iPhone while protecting it!! Best case ever!!
Such a great deal! Awesome quality too.
"This product has an overall sleek, clean and qualatative feel. The performance and amount is perfect on trips where you'll be up and roaming around. Got another person or two who needs to charge their device? As long as you have the corresponding cables three people can charge at the same time; One though would be charging at a slower speed. The charger can be a hefty one pound but stick this in a backpack and it'll help. With alot of charging power, the weight or portabilty doesnt bother me as much."
"I have a hard hearing with this.  I only use it in an office so it is not back round noise.  My hearing is very good, so it is the product."
Very fast shipping and the case itself is great. Looks very expensive and fancy. Great price. Already received compliments on it!
"It was a little hard to get on but after I got it on, it serves the purpose."
Excellent
I love this! I can easily charge my phone quick without plunging it to a charger.
this is great everything
I was a little disappointed when I got the case because it is a little more rubbery than hard plastic. Also the volume buttons became very easy to press on accident.
Nicer than pictured
"I wish I would have had this the day I bought my iPhone. The bevel protects the screen very well. The screen cover doesn't impede function or viewing. It is a bit bulky but I never notice the size unless I handle an iPhone without a cover. The port covers for the charger, headphones, etc are a bit annoying but I'd rather have them then not have them."
"So far so good... Fast, camera is iffy. Overall great phone for the price. Call quality isn't very good.. Kinda quiet.. Sometimes scratchy.. Might be my location though, I don't get the best service area.."
"Glass covered up the half the &#34;Home&#34; button. Did not match the phone at all.  ordered it right with the  case not sure how I ended up with the wrong one. Looked like heavy duty, but couldnt use it."
Super happy with this product.... One of the best in the market....
Heavy duty cord. Premium build. Excellent overall value
Once charged it lasts for weeks without using it as often but still lasts a week or so using it daily. Love it!
Love it the case is beautiful and just perfect and it arrived on time great service! !!!!!!!!
This things junk! The picker quality sucks! The play the time back doesn't work half the time. The GPS cable  comes out all the time. And it died after three months of us.
Works as advertised.
"one star<br /><br />I hate to give a one star...Took the phone to be repaired by a professional... Long story short, I was sold a bad screen & requested a refund."
Fairly disappointed. It does not seat properly in the outlet.  Some times it charges and then sometimes falls slightly loose and stops charging.  I have played with it but it just does not seem to be designed properly. Hope I can still return it.
No finger prints yah
I heart this case...will buy other colors soon to complete my galaxy case wardrobe:)
"Delivered very quickly. Well packaged.<br />Unit feels very solid and made well. Jacks feel secure not flimsy. I used it to charge my Nexus 5 and an iPhone 6 - not at same time, duh, but right after each other.. Both started at about 20% battery and charged to about 95% on both.. Only consumed 2 led lights off the unit. I was very happy to see it can handle this capacity. This isbgreat if you're going out for a full day and having more than one device to recharge.<br />Im very happy with this purchase.. As long as they don't change anything I suspect you will be, too."
Perfect Fit!!!
This is an okay product. It had a hard time holding my LG G3 without a case and did not fit into the vent very well. It kept on swaying left and right due to the clip not being small enough to create a good grip.
"Fix perfectly! Maintained the phone's elegant! Got 2 of these for my mom and gf, they both loved it! =&#62; Man of the house = 5 STARS!!! Would buy again in different colors!"
Very good
My mom was super happy with this. She still uses this case. Im so glad that I was able to get this for her.
Was not compatible with an 04 Tundra which it claims to be
Very nice i iwll buy it again.
"This case is very rugged and protects the iPhone very well, but the built-in screen protector makes the phone very difficult and frustrating to use.  The screen protector doesn't sit directly upon the phone's screen, there is a tiny bit of airspace between, so you have to push in with a bit of force to do anything with the phone.  This makes texting, zooming in or out, scrolling etc. all difficult.  The home button is also covered by a thin membrane, so Touch ID doesn't work as well as usual either.  I read online about removing the built-in screen protector and using a thin glass one instead, but decided it would be easier to just return it and find a different solution."
Excellent
OK
excelente
Loved the case. Hated my ex. Easily flammable.
"Works great and charges fast, perfect to keep in a purse or backpack."
It took a while to get here but the product is great.
Good.
"Good price and good case.  Clip rotates, has a stand for displaying the phone horiaontally."
"I find this thick and bulky.  I like the silicon or jelly covers much, much better.  It also falls off.  keep looking."
Very nice!
Perfect fit
"Good:  Works in my 2003 Civic if I plug it in, attach my phone, unplug it for 5 seconds, and then plug it back in. Bad:  Doesn't work in my 2013 Tundra at all even following the plug/unplug/plug procedure.  UPDATE:  After 7 months of use the three metal pieces on the end have fallen off.  One of them went missing so the whole thing is a loss now."
Ive hade this charger for over 2yrs and still works great best money ive spent
"I have about three different cases for my G2, this is by far the best one."
well worth the cost.  difficult to see/feel the button icons in the darkness of the early morning.
not leather
Great product
I mean it's great but I thought it would cover top and bottom more but I really enjoy it
Not as good as I'd hoped
Bit loose
Only used 1 time doesnt work anymore 😡<br />Its a nice and small stick but that happends to me
Worked great for a couple weeks then nothing. This is my second one with the same result.
"Best case ever. Used for a long time. Coloring came off when I tried to clean it, or I'd still use it"
"Very pretty, fits iPhone 4 nicely, but if you are looking for a case to protect your phone, look elsewhere."
Awesome phone
Color/picture is just as vivid as on the Internet.  Case fits iPhone 6 perfectly. My 12 year old loves it! It even has a little pocket for her lunch money.
The solar charger does not hold a charge. Not worth purchasing.
"So I have had my device for all of 6 hours......can't say that I am overly thrilled. Received this the heart band and the color slides for an overdue birthday gift. My first observation is the small is clearly not small enough. I can slide one whole finger into the band and that is it on the smallest hole I get to, leaving two holes open because the device itself is so wide I can't get it any tighter (see picture). I can't figure out if there is a specific place I am supposed to tap on it because I will tap it in five different places before it wakes up. What I do like is that it does not look like the obvious Fitbit most ppl have. But know I am wondering with the bad reviews from the app, should I have just gone with the majority????? The color is very subtle, but appropriate. I will give it more time. I do like the text messages, the move texts, etc. that is pretty neat."
so pretty and reeky has protected my phone from cracking (after dropping it in the parking lot!)
great
It's a really great cd  player. The one thing is it makes the cds  really really hot. But other than that it works well and is a great cd player. It's easy to install and we'll worth the money
A little tight but I fixed that!
the lights for caps lock and num lock were broke when i got it out of the box wasn't very happy.
The glass chipped off at the side. Didnt even drop it and only place in my bag all the time. Not sure it is really tempered glass as claimed. Will like a refund if possible.
my wife seems to like the case
I've had this case on my phone for over two years and it has worked splendidly. It has yet to let my phone suffer any damage and I drop it all the time. Such a great case for the price.
Good for this phone
"It was not broken or scratched, I've had it more a month and it's still in good condition, no cracks, even after dropping it many times."
"I love this case. It's not bulky, yet if I ever drop my phone it absorbs the shock and nothing breaks! It looks great and feels great. The only downside is that you can see dirt easy (if you have a white phone). Highly recommend!"
I ordered this for my Garmin Fenix 3 and it fits perfectly with zero issues!!!!  The order was processed right away and it arrived in Afghanistan within seven days of being purchased.  The application was simple and applied with zero complications.  Being deployed in a combat zone requires additional stress on your body and equipment.  My watch is subjected to continual abuse and this film is a life saver.  Thank you for the wonderful product and the fact it is made in the USA is an additional bonus.
"This is a good case that seems to have great protection so far. I thought I would be bored with the simple blue, but it's a sleek design and how often do you look at the back anyway? Decent price in the world of phone cases, the lack of some kind of &#34;kickstand&#34; is the only critique I have. You would think everyone would have that standard by now."
works as expected very long
"This is a very clever and handy way to hold my smart phone onto the steering wheel. I tend to hang out in the car and watch utube videos on the phone and this fits and holds my LG G4 phone perfectly. It's a bit of a stretch to get it over the edges, but it holds it securely. And the fact that the phone can be turned either upright or horizontally is great."
It is not galaxy s4 compatible due to the absence of the headset cutout
Couldn't here it phone was loader!  Through in garbage.
"The case is exactly as described, fits perfectly and is comfortable to hold. I love the colors."
I GOT IT FOR MY SON'S IPHONE 5C AND HE HAS TO TAKE THE CASE OFF EVERY TIME HE CHARGES IT.  HE JUST DOESN'T USE IT ANYMORE.
Great value and they really dont tangle up!
Did what it claimed to do.  Easy to work. I used on a Samsung charge
Had for a couple days and so far so good!
"Great case as usual. This is my third phone with a Diztronic case. I keep buying them because they always fit great and look good. Button covers are good, too."
My first case fidnt get delivered  so they sent a new one right away. It is everything i was looking for. It is good quality and holding up very well.
"Not particularly thrilled with the performance of this battery bank. I purchased this in March and have used it probably twenty times or less. It no longer will charge my phone. I suspect something is wrong with the USB port, as the light will only turn on if I hold the cord carefully in it. Even then, it does not charge. I will try to see if this will be covered under warranty but for now I cannot recommend it.<br />For the time that it was working, it performed decently enough. It took forever to charge, though. I would go for a better bank if I had to purchase again."
I love these ear buds. The sound quality is amazing. They are easy to switch from music to phone and fit my ear canals nicely. I will definitely use them for many years to come. I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
Strong and attractive case. My only complaint is that the thickness of the case does nor allow me to insert certain headphone plugs
Rubber on the case started to take the screen protector off the phone
Great speaker
"I love this case.  It's stylish, cute and with just enough bling."
Horrible quality! It came open in the sides.<br />I wouldn't purchase again.
Think might be able to fit around my wrist. Good for someone with child sized arms.
"The really really bad:<br />1) I think that these headrests are potentially unsafe in a rear-end collision.  They tilt quite far before they hit the tilt limit (the whole headrest tilts, not just the screen) and the connection between the posts (that go into the seat) and the headrest is plastic.  I just am not at all confident that they would actually protect my neck in a rear-end collision.<br /><br />2) Problem 2 is that the audio did not work.  No sound out when headphones were plugged in (not sure if these have internal speakers or not, but also no sound when no headphones were plugged in.  Checked the operation of the DVD player (working fine), tried a few different head phones, no luck.  Contacted Pyle, and they said to return it.<br /><br />The good: They fit my car well (2006 Honda CRV) and were fairly easy to install.  There are included post shims for use with cars with different sized head-rest holes (NOTE: 2 of these shims have slots cut in them - the instructions don't say, but I think these are to allow the latch on the seat to engage the notches on the headrest posts) and the posts adjust side-to-side to allow for different post spacings.  There is a mechanism to keep the head-rest centered."
Love this case.  It was just what I was looking for and much less expensive than the Sprint store...about 1/4 the cost!
I love it
It charges my Windows Phone at about 1% per minute in late afternoon direct sun here in Arizona.  Good product.
"Best car charger I've ever purchased. Both a Quick Charge 2.0 port which we all know charges capable phone's extremely fast, but also has a regular 2.4A port that also charges crazy fast! It charged a full sized laptop from empty to full in a bit over an hour. (Drive from Jersey Shore to Jersey City)"
This product is amazing. It is very protective and a very nice case!!
I bought this for my tablet because I keep score for on it for my daughters travel softball team.  This gives me added protection from the elements.  The on issue I noticed is that on the hot days I do get an over heat warning from the tablet- but I feel that is ok because it did not shut down on me and my thoughts were the case really does seal my tablet in good
Case is pretty awesome! The kickstand is great for watching Netflix and Youtube. Case feels good in the hand and protects the phone well. Right after I put it on I went dog walking (I'm a pet sitter) and the dog pulled while I was changing songs on my phone. It dropped on the concrete but was completely fine. Not even a scratch on the case. Will recommend to friends.
"Simple to use, accurate.  Has courses pre-loaded.  Uses buttons instead of touch screen."
Just what I needed
Works great.  I have different types of devices plugged in and charges as expected.
"When considering purchasing this phone case I, per normal, read all the reviews and was encouraged that this would be a safe purchase.<br />I won't keep you but I just want to say, BUT THIS CASE!!! All the 4 & 5 star reviews are dead on target. I can't find anything negative to report so relax and hit the &#34;add to shopping cart&#34; button, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Have a great day!"
"I now realize purchasing an item from iBOLT was a mistake. First, the short cable on the back of the mount would not stay locked into place. Also, the included USB cables charge VERY slow, since they only charge at .5 amps. Next I noticed the little rubber pads that secure the phone fall apart every time you mount and unmount the phone. The final straw was when the little ball that holds the phone mount to the arm snapped off. Now it is unusable. Save your money and purchase a quality product from another company."
"Fits the Note 3, not Note 4. Very dissatisfied. Forced it onto my phone and the pressure on the side buttons had the phone constantly restarting itself."
Doesn't hold a charge sometimes hard to hear
"Light, thin yet a durable case. I bought the teal one but the color is not as bright as it in the picture :( but I still love the case. Thinking of getting it in different colors. :)"
"It worth the price. I think it's nice smartphone. I strongly recommen it. But the battery life is short, just charge it regularly"
Love these cases they are light and easy to use.. Very light on the belt and doesn't feel like it's weighing down ur pants...they are great!
IT CAME IN BROKEN AND THE BACK OF THE CASE WAS SCRATCHED UP
Love this case so far although I thought it came with a back not just a screen protector for the back of the phone.
Perfect fit
Great looking case!  Fits great and sticks out about an inch past the screen to provide plenty of protection in the case of a drop.  UPDATE: Revising to 4 stars because I have the Ceramic White back and there are small but visible &#34;polka dots&#34; that make the phone appear dirty (see photo).  Apparently all the clear cases do this but just a warning to those with the Ceramic White case.
Great case and cute too.
"Gift for my Daughter, she was very pleased with the performance, of these headphones, and she is very picky."
Works ok - Bought a Dual USB adapter to put in the top (As the side usb ports are useless if you mount in the console). Would not power the adapter and ended up not being able to use the product for the trip as needed. Looks nice - very sleek and small.
"This would be probably my fourth Anker product and there is a reason for it. The charger is at par with latest smartphone chargers. I own a OnePlus One and did a charge test. There is absolutely no noticeable difference between as far as charge time is concerned. Tested the ampere rating with app as well, they both perform quite similar. Bought it off a sale day at $8 bucks.  Pros: - Super quick charging i.e. Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 with 2A output - 3ft long powerful cable included which is ideal for most uses - Sub $10 price point"
I love this the price was better than in the store and it sounds clear.
Case works great essy out and in for the samsung s4 cell phone
"hardly to take off,don't buy it!"
"Nice radio, perfect size, works well, programing requires some research if you haven't done it before,  I spent 2 hrs to get my windows based  computer system de virused , then about 30 min trying to figure out how to make windows let me down load the required programing software, then I looked at videos on you tube and was programing these baby's Likity split,  always get the proper cable from milklor, do not get the cheep cable seen on a-z,  etc.  the program you need is called chirp and you will need the daily build,  I'm using these for simplex in wilderness areas and to monitor co fire and rescue, and of course noaa weather. These  radios have the solid feel of professional equipment, some people complained about the chargers but mine worked perfectly, may be a upgrade."
works great
Better than otterbox cases
"I wore this tracker to my first water class today. After class misfit fell out of band, and will not recommend"
"Works great with my 5s. Make sure to REMOVE PHONE if you turn on the heater!. Makes it somewhat less than ideal in the winter, however it's easy to remove if needed."
good product.  The kit came with things (location tabs and dust sticker) that were not present in the last tempered glass cover I purchased.
Love having an extra battery
OK
Purchased as an interface between my iPad and Apple 5 Phone.  When connected to my car radio it will not allow the music to play thru the radio.  It will charge but that is all.  Useless
Amazing product with affordable price
Love it
Very sturdy and hold my iphone 6 in place. Great product.
"Good quality case, more durable and better than the last two cases I've gone thru."
"I bought 2 pairs one for me and the other for my wife.  She didn't like them,  i gave it a shot.  The music part of it works well, good base. But the voice calls part was bad. The microphone had a problem picking up my voice,  i had to almost scream.  One side of the ear peace stopped working so i ended up shelving the unit and now took my wife's.  Lets see how long those work."
I like this speaker the sound quality is rich.  I can put it outside while doing some project and while taking a shower.  It is convenient and easy to pair with my devices.
great
love it! fits perfectly.
Fits great and the screen is fully protected
I take this with me every time I go to the beach and it works Amazingly!! NOT a single drop reaches my phone
My phone fit perfectly into the wallet.  It looks sleek and neat. Would highly recommend.
It does not charge well had it plugged in all night and it wasn't charged it was @ 60% . Not pleased
Very good product and easy to install.
Worked great. Happy with it.
TPU or die
Love this case and carrier. High quality and not big and bulky like some are.
Gooood
"To start, This amp is beautiful. The illumination is my favorite. More importantly, this really pumps my 2 10&#34; kicker compvr subwoofers in my 350z. Awesome amp!!"
Very nice!
"Works great, I bolted it to my hat for hunting. I sanded the ball for a smoother action. The 1/4-20 threads on my mount were fine (unlike another reviewers)"
Really Nice
All I was was a black case and a sticker on it
good material
muy bien
Now I don't have to worry if my battery is low. Big help when losing power on my phone. I always bring it with me every time we go out of time. Love it.
My daughter loves the protection this case gives her.
worked great for vacation. didn't have to carry wallet and phone. Only minus is you can't carry more then a few dollar bills but if you're like me and mostly carry cards it is fine.
"good value, fast shipping!  Hard outer case has good feel...kick stand quality reflects the price"
Got it before actually  :) lol and it looks awesome on my galaxy! I bought it because Im majoring in forensics so I like that stuff.
Great Product
Good
Thanks.  Sk8Maui.com MauiStyleAloha.com
Don't buy. Nonexistent customer service. Bought in July 2015 and used  3 times. Only use when at beach.  The cover for charging port fell off and small metal post that supposedly secures the cover was lost. Tried to return to Amazon but beyond their return window. Case has 1 year warranty for return but can not find manufacturer contact information despite thorough web search.
"Never written a review before, but after reading so many others, figured I had to post as well.<br /><br />This 100% does not work the way it is intended, I'm now looking for a new radio that has an AV jack so I can just plug my IPhone directly into the radio.  This product is beyond frustrating, could not find a single station that would play music without a ridiculous amount of static.  Paid $30 at Target, will be returning this product ASAP."
Works very well and is very stylish. You have to center the phone exactly on it though and confirm that the light changes from red to blue.
Excellent
"This was a gift for my husband.  I had initially planned on getting an AppleWatch for him, but I hated the rubber looking wrist band on the most affordable model.  I liked the looks of the Pebble and the fact that it would work with most phones.  My husband was thrilled with it!  It looks MUCH nicer than the AppleWatch.  The leather band suited my husband better.  He knows better than I how the apps are with it, but I do know he is pleased with all aspects of this watch.  I would definitely recommend the Pebble to anyone thinking about an AppleWatch and not wanting to spend so much on a rubber watch!"
The case looks exactly as the picture. It arrived on time. Is pretty and looks great.
Love it!
Second batch ordered and neither worked as advertised the adapter is too small for the hole in the iPhone6
"I've tried all sorts of bluetooth headphones for running, including some of the more expensive ones. These are the best I've found. They are extremely comfortable, the volume is more than adequate (many bluetooth headphones have volume issues), the batter life is good, and they are easy to use. I had an issue with the pair I received and I was rushed a replacement pair. It was an excellent customer experience. If you are a runner, these are perfect."
"This is the second one of these that I have purchased; the first one lasted for nearly 8 months before the corners started to crack and fall off, but this second one lasted less than 10 days. The plastic near the volume and power buttons is very fragile and will break apart if you're not careful. It's a shame because these are really good looking cases."
I'm not too happy with this case...its mad slippery...the back feels a sticker on cardboard. When I put the phone in the gummy part of the case does not sorround the case because of the hard shell...in a couple weeks I will put my old case back on...this is garbage.
You can not hear nothing with this cover.
Very pleased. Works great and no hassle easy to use
Excelente
Excellent quality. Love that the case is detachable and that the protective case is thin so still fits with factory belt clip.  Love it!
Easy to apply and practically invisible.
I loved this product so much that after a few months of using it in my own car I purchased one for my wife's car as well. The 2.4A charging port is super-fast and the extra port is a huge plus. I have had no issues with either of the 2 chargers I have purchased and would absolutely purchase from this seller again in the future.
Broke already
"Great sleek feel. With an extremely long lasting battery, saved my life countless times in situations where I needed my phone but couldn’t get to a charger nearby."
Better than I imagined it would be. This is a high quality band that looks and performs as well as the official Apple band. Only difference is its a fraction of the cost.
Very pleased.
"This is the perfect case for my Galaxy S5.  I have had it for a few months and the case has not had any discoloration.  I like the fit and the sturdiness.  I have dropped my phone a few times, face down on hard surfaces.  So far, the case has protected my Galaxy.  I would purchase again."
"I'm very disappointed in this. The case seems sturdy enough, and fits my iPad Air 2 very nicely, but I can't make my iPad stand no matter what I do. It just slides and lays down flat. The white color is more an off white, not particularly nice. The graphic on it (dandelion) is pretty lousy. It's somewhat distorted and not clear, a dull black. Seems like a cheap job of putting it on the case, like maybe it was stretched too much to make it fit. At least it was cheap."
Lower price and works as it supposed to. I am happy with it.
"Great speakers for the price and the quality!!!  I bought this as a gift for someone who really appreciates some good hard BASS.  I did some research online on portable/bluetooth/wireless speakers, comparing different reviews and ratings online, and in the end it came down to three speakers rated for great bass/sub performance.  Of the three (one of them was the SONY SRS-X5), I decided to go with the Jabra.  I based this decision on three things, price, durability, and aesthetics.  The Jabra SOLEMATE is a bit under $100 including shipping for Amazon Prime members, unlike its other competitor speakers with quality sub performance.  Furthermore, the thick soles of the speaker really caught my attention.  Most electronic products on the market usually have some form of weak little rubber glued on each corner at the bottom.  However, the Jabra SOLEMATE has this cool looking sole great for absorbing any impact for setting the speakers down.  Did I mention that it looks awesome?  Oh yes, and back to the Original decision factor, the bass.  Oh wow the bass.  The quality of sound that comes out of this little thing is still mind blowing.  The volume, clarity, and BASS!!!! just all around WOWmazing!!!  After testing them out and using it for a little under a week, I am already looking into buying another one for myself."
Great price and easy shopping with promo code. giving fair review is so worth the price :)
I mlove this case thank you!
Itemas described! Works Great!
"Tablets, phones, MP3 players, fitness bands... I can think of a dozen devices we regularly need to charge. Instead of having charging blocks scattered throughout the house, we now have a central charging location. Power IQ is a huge bonus. Devices always charge as fast as with their original chargers. No longer waiting twice as long for a tablet to charge because you can't locate the right charging block. I don't think any device takes more than 2 hours to fully charge, so we've been able to rotate devices through and share cables.If there's any buyer's remorse, it's that we didn't get more ports."
"Works great, would definitely recommend."
Only one worked! It works great but I needed two not one!
hooked up working good
The magnet not keeping it close.not happy.
"This is such a neat, compact device.  Love it!"
"Nice product, exactly like pictures"
exactly what I needed
"Great replacement head unit for your factory stereo. Connects Bluetooth to Apple and Android with the options of aux and USB inputs. Doesn't work with Windows mobile but its not a problem for me, just putting it out there. You can still connect to the aux port."
Loved it!
Not real leather.
These work very well. Nothing fancy. Just a dual USB charger that you can't go wrong with.
Great little case.
Colors were very nice.
Charges all my mobile devices fast. Very handy.
Love it and keeping it.
Never had a screen protector with so much attention to detail!!! I love this product and the lifetime warranty.
Poor quality<br />Keeps disconnected<br />Does not stay connected to cigarette lighter
"Great item so far. Shipping was faster (10 days from Etronixmart) than what was listed on the order (2 months) which was a nice bonus. The buttons on the GPD XD also feels nice, similar to a 3ds xl but with double analogs that feels really smooth like a ps vita as well. All in all great device."
Perfect black minimalistic TPU case for S5.
As advertised.
"Fast service, the case is really nice and strong. Would purchase again from seller."
After the install there were grid linpv
I haven't dropped my iPhone yet but my wife and I each bought one and we are very happy with the quality.
"It was not working well for my hp pavilion touch screen... I tried to draw a line on the screen but instead of getting a continuous line, I always got dotted lines... I contact amazon for refund and I returned the product... 👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿"
The box was cracked and chip
"Anker makes excellent 3rd part products for all mobile devices.  They are my first choice of manufacturer, cable was 10 feet long, is thick and sturdy and works well.  Can't ask for much more"
"vey cute, stretchy and nice color. fits well for a teenager."
Used on my last trip. You can charge too devices at once.
Good deal
one of the best models samsung ever did
Paint hasn't chiped and stand still working.
Super cute but it broke way too easily. You get what you pay for
love these
"Nice quality, saved my phone from a few accidents already"
"Great purchase,  exactly as described"
love that it didn't block the other plug in the double outlet
Cheap and sounds decent. My stock haed unit is okay but I need a 4 channel to really enjoy these. One surround had a dimple since the packaging facility at Rockford put all screws in little baggies and the bag got wedged under the surround and on top of the spider. Only cosmetic as the speaker works perfectly. Also found a home depot receipt in a box also. Lol buried treasure. Thanks seller for not including anthrax.
"Bought the Geekout 1000 a couple of weeks back. Boy was I blown away. it may seem deceptively small but the sound it produces will blow your mind. the moment the geekout is plugged in, it makes the entire song come alive and one can be lost in the subtle nuances of the music forever. best DAC I ever had."
"Had for 2 months, screen failed. Worked good up until now.  Just started repair process with Garmin, will keep you posted on how it goes."
"At best, a fair fit. Does not cover sides and bottom edges well at bezel. Buttons very hard to use. Warped at top of bezel. Would not buy again. Too many better choices for the money."
"AMAZING! It has kept my phone in one piece for the last few years. Countless drops and all, it has been a saving grace!"
great
"Cobra's iconic 148 GTL took a slight redesign in the phase-locked loop system back in 2008 utilizing a Chinese produced chip . The radio out-of-the-box is acceptable, performance is a bit low but with a few tweaks to make it a relatively good, loud CB radio. Out-of-the-box, most of these radios are 200 to 300 Hz frequency, perfectly acceptable under FCC standards but by resetting to dead center on all bands radio audio quality on the receiving end really pops as it stands out. If you're wishing to add an echo board to the radio, do not use the turbo echo board products as they have a tendency to growl and continuously reverberate unnecessarily in deep echo. I would also suggest that you purchase as an option a 12 gauge 3 pin power plug for Cobra but only change the fuse out to one more amp if the radio has been properly performance tuned, as the additional current draw in SSB will cause a warble when using single side band with the original power cord. In a.m. mode with out the upgraded power cord , the TX modulation tiends to peak negative on an oscilloscope as the unit is virtually power starved at 95% modulation with the original power cord. An indication of being power starved is if the meter lights dim when you're talking, it is because it is not getting enough current to operate efficiently. Also, if this radio is modified for additional frequencies you will find that it is somewhat less stable than the..... older 148 GTL's"
"First radio, can't go to much in depth on it. After I get my liscence and see what it can do I'll update."
Great phone! Everything is so smooth and the camera exceeded my expectation. Also cool that you can get a Gear VR and turn this phone into an amazing VR  kit.
"They are cables, and they work. :)  They feel premium not sure what else to say."
Great product worked great with my phone Samsung galaxy 6
"I really enjoyed these headphones they looked very retro which I liked. A lot of headphones now days look very high-tech  and even though these do not support Bluetooth I would still buy these so I could jam out in style.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Very Sleek<br />-Threaded cable<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Its not the big over the ear headphones its actually one of those on the ear headphones<br /><br />Overall:<br />Amazing Sound and very stylish as expected. Plus, the headphones are limited edition so get yours before these run out definitely a great steal for the price.<br /><br />Promotion Disclaimer:<br />I received this product during a promotional period in exchange for a unbiased review."
These are so cute and seem to work very well!  My granddaughters love them and I have fun with them too!
"These worked really good, until they didn't. Recently, these have been shorting, and causing my phone to become really hot, and stop charging on times. This is really annoying, and I stopped using these because I was worried it could damage my phone."
As advertised
Earphones dnt work  very well
Does what is supposed to
Excellent case!  Really good quality.  I have to say that I was surprised at just how well made it is considering it's so cheap.  It feels nice - not as if it'll fall apart quickly.  It's protected my iPod very well (I've dropped and bashed it a few times already!).  I would definitely buy this brand again.
"Works great, and the length of it works perfectly for me!"
This case does NOT fit the G4 with the leather back like the description claims. It doesn't wrap all the way to the front of the phone and somehow my phone got damage to the bottom edge while putting this case on. It's going back.
"I got a pair of these because one of my friends recommended them. Compared to the 400$+ Beats Audio they are great! They are loud with little to no interference. I use them running, working out, and normal day-to-day activities!! I love these and for the price you can't beat them!"
very uncomfortable and people have a hard time hearing you. Would never buy this again. Save your money for some LG pros that you wear around your neck. Those are awesome!
"I purchased 3 of this holder; 1 for myself, my husband, and son.  It's perfect!  Holds my iPhone 6 plus so I can use it for navigation.  Great buy!!"
Not good at all.
Ummmmm this does not charge my iPhone 6. Sad:( and sad I have to plug something into my iphone6... I just wanted to be able to place it and charge it.
Feels like good quality. Works with my Galaxy S6 fast charger. I guess time will tell but so far so good.
"I expected silicone but instead I got a hard snap on case , and the description said silicone 😒 I wouldn't have bought it if I knew it was a hard case"
In exchange for a fair review they gave me a discount. I LOVE this company. Love the products that I purchased!
"not as slim as the speck case, and the black (intended to be non reflective) area around the camera hole isn't painted completely (white showing through around the edges)."
The phone cover was purchased with the need of having more grip for my not so nimble fingers. It works great. Shipment was prompt and no problems. It serves my need very well.
Feels nice and slim. Really adds no bulk but the case started peeling off on the back. After about 2 weeks. Not happy. Especially since the color really complimented the original gold of the iPhone 6
Love it
First week into owning this junk and the holster dropped it a dozen times and broke the screen on my brand new phone. Took it off and trashed it. The design of the holster is poorly engineered and relies solely on the retention of the plastic nubs to hold it in place. One little jolt and it tumbles out right onto the ground. Steps down from equipment ladders are what matched the wits of the designers of this product.
Case is very sturdy and seems to deliver the protection i need. Color seems bright and vibrant. Authentication 10/10 !!!
Great stylus . I bought this one as a back up for one I already have had for a couple years.
"Actual phone cover is strong and fully protects.  Unfortunately, the holster broke immediately upon first try at using stand function.  Glued the stand on permanently so lost that function.  Then, 3 days later the clip broke.  Right at the hinge where a flimsy design (just like half a dozen I've wasted money on) results in conplete failure of last feature; the belt clip. . Don't waste your money.  I'd give it lower rating but the actual case is pretty sturdy, especially if you used lots of Super Glue to hold the stand undeployed, which is a drag."
charges very slow
"Clear image but four stars since you cant really set it on top of the dashboard as the image will be upside down when you review it.  It has to be mounted on the windshield for proper image view.  Bumped up to 4 since I actually use it, clear image, and has survived a month in the Texas summer heat and the vendor contacted me asking for a more favorable review  but my original intent was for it to be mounted on the dash, not the windshield and there is no setting to reverse the image."
"Good looking case, especially for the price.  The only thing I didn't like was the screen protector.  My Touch ID wasn't working with the profits teen protector.  I removed it and kept the shatter proof protector that I already had on my phone."
Screen went blank after a couple of months.
"I received this product in exchange for a unbiased review,the shipping was fast and packaged securely the instructions were easy to follow and this screen protector fit my device perfectly. all ports and speakers work properly, fingerprints are easy to wipe off. i put on a case right afterwards and the screen protector didn't interfere made of durable materials and keeps my screen safe from damage. I have dropped my phone several times since and I also keep it in a large purse nice price for the durability and quantity"
My son has a Lg Optimus.<br />He is always dropping his phone and has has even got a small chip on the corner of the glass.<br />I purchased this for him to put his phone in so that it will be well protected and easy for him to use.<br />He has no problem accessing any features of his phone now.<br />This case is light weight and i love that it has a viewing window on the front of the cover so you can see the clock or notifications.<br />It is stylish and he loves it.<br />His phone now is safe and sound against drops .<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. However I don't just give glowing reviews to a product just because i received it free or a discount. If my review helped you in any way please click
Good quality. I really like it!
Perfect fit. Compliments from everyone
works perfect
Love it easy to use and the bamboo goes with my wood.  Delivery was quicker than expected.
"I now have an iPhone 5 with a new lease of life with a good battery.  As well as carefully reviewing the good instructions and video, I would recommend that you search youtube.com for &#34;iphone pry damage&#34;.  The riskiest part of replacing an iPhone battery is damaging the circuit board around the battery when prying off the battery.  While the instructions provided here show the &#34;safe&#34; places to pry, other sources suggest only the case edge should be used.  I also recommend doing this in a warm environment, we did this in a hot room on a very hot day and the higher temperature very likely softened the adhesive and made the prying relatively easy.  It takes a while from the case side and there are some rather unnerving ripping like sounds as the adhesive gives way but it all worked in the end.<br /><br />A good product at a great price.  I take off one start because the pentalobe tool was too big for the screws on my iPhone 5 - a Nov 2012 Verizon edition.  I don't know if the pentastar screws got bigger in later editions but coaxing these screws out at the start of the procedure was the most difficult part of the whole exercise.  The screen removal and even the battery prying were quicker in comparison!"
"I'm very disappointed in the 750 series for this product.<br /><br />My first pair I bought in April. The pair worked great, had great audio, great volume, fit nicely, and would last for hours at a time. Now, they will only stay charged for a range between six minutes to half an hours, making them unusable for my normal listening habits. Note while I typically would fully charge them over night, I tended to let them get down to 10-25% power each evening after heavy usage. Charged with a micro-usb plugged directly into a PC tower.<br /><br />My second pair I bought for my wife in July. She immediately complained about low sound quality/volume which confused me since mine had great audio. I just assumed she didn't care for the in hear headphones style but when my model started to not keep a charge, I tried her pair out. I was surprised just how quiet everything is on her pair. Audio programs I could keep at 25-50% volume on my phone and one or two clicks from the max on the old headset had to be set to max on both devices in order to be heard. Sadly by the time I noticed I was past the return window.<br /><br />I don't recommend the 750 for these issues. My previous devices kept a charge for over two years, and the volume stayed consistent. To have two devices back to back fail like this makes me concerned about trying another version of this product."
cheap but you get what you paid for! Basically was just a filler to get up to where I could get free ship.
"Velcro lasted about 5 seconds. On first attempt to unfasten the Velcro, the glue released from the bag. Good thing the bag has 3 zip locks so the Velcro isn't really needed anyway. I like the strap and I easily fit my Bluetooth speaker and two phones plus ID and a Credit card with no issues."
The colors are vibrant and easy to see in my purse.
This didn't even last one year. Plastic part broke off and no longer charges. Also the charger would get extremely hot.
"The iPhone 5 arrived a day earlier than expected. It looks like new. So far it has worked very well, and I'm especially pleased with the strength of the battery. My only question is regarding the 6 months warranty. There was no paperwork regarding it in the package."
Love it!
This decal is a perfect fit with my lifeproofcase and my phone looks great.
"is only for 5 months,I brought in march and not work."
Works!
Fashionable wristbands.  Love it. Small size fits my tiny wrists.
"Best phone I've ever owned. Not the fastest processor ever, not the best looking screen ever, not the best camera ever, but darn does it get good battery life. I can regularly go 48hrs on a single charge. If I start a day at 100%, even using lots of data and navigating with the GPS, I still have 40%+ by the end of the day. It's great. I'll gladly give up some of the fancy features to not ever be tied down to a phone charger again."
"Well, I bought one, and it worked fine for a few months. But I dropped my phone, and the screen cracked, not the screen protector. very disappointing. Woulnd't buy another one."
Looks great and works well.
"Nice, but only two of the three worked.  But, the two that did work have worked flawlessly."
"I got these for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter - they fit a little big, but she can still use them without any problems. They are plenty loud enough for her, without getting too loud. Easy to use with the IPad so she can watch her shows."
"The particular cable is just about the same price, had I bought those at TJ Maxx or Ross, and theirs are of more thicker cables than the ones I ordered from yourselves, just as thick as the original Apple cable that comes in the box."
Attractive and very functional. Heavy enough not to be inadvertently knocked over! Well worth the price!
"Doesn't hold a charge for Long..  When I charge it all day, then it doesn't last 2 hours and it won't hold a charge on stand by. Yes it works but I don't recommend it."
This battery is functioning like the original that came with the phone. It will lengthen the life of my irreplaceable phone again.
Exactly what I expected.  Easy to install.
"It take a little to instal, but it works perfectly. I works with my Amazon Echo."
It's a good stereo  and economic.
"This is an updated review of these earbuds.  After about a month of using them once a week for about 2 hours each use, they keep disconnecting/reconnecting to my iPhone while I'm listening to music.  It happens frequently enough that it may do it once, twice or even three times during a single song.  The earbuds are fully charged while this is happening and the iPhone is in my pocket.  It has gotten so bad that I'm going to request either a replacement or refund."
My arm is not super skinny but I am petite and this does not stay on my arm bc there is not enough velcrow when I wrap it.
Fit perfectly
Very good produt
Works great! Even matches my interior accents
"Affordable price. Comfy. This is my second pair. Loved the color. This time I received a discount for reviewing the product. However, it is a well deserved review."
"Poor quality as far as the color (black) on the outside part that covers the glass, the color started to erase easily after a week or less using my nail and simple touches to hard sufraces"
"Great product, delivered early. Easy to install and bubble free as stated. Crystal clear like there isn't a protector at all."
Very sturdy. Attracts great conversations with fellow Hogwartians!!!
"Perfect for quickly charging all of my Apple devices at once. A must have if you are a family with multiple tablets, phones, etc."
"Very nice quality and fits the TomTom 5100 perfectly. I only wish it was half as thick though, as the unit has to be tucked into the pocket or equipment straps on one side, leaving the other side empty, or it will flop around. Good if you had a power cable or something to carry, but mine is fixed to the car mount."
Didn't even stay on a week.  Kept popping off and was lost.  Don't waste your money.
So far so good. I have a Surface Pro which requires the AC adapter port and have had the opportunity to test the device out. Very happy so far.
"These offer me a sense of protection with my Fitbit -- I don't worry that it will fall off unexpectedly.  Additionally, the bright colors are a nice spark of happiness for my otherwise dull black Fitbit."
Great for on the go. Its a bit smaller then my S6 works great and charges my phone fast..I have done the charging of two phones at once and did not have to charge them both together.
"This product works exactly as advertised! It is the best solution for everyone's needs to if you're on the fence about it, just know that you won't be disappointed."
Don't fit
Great
Cool design durable
I have now purchased 2 of these. This is a very durable product. I have dropped alot of things on my screen and the product has not failed.
Excelent. The only one problem i have with it is that it last too much to charge.. but its 10k mah how not?
"It works for the htc tmobile my touch 4g, it works great"
"Opened the package, made sure the phone fit, went to put clip over belt and the entire clip came right off.  The clip is supposed to be connected by a single rivet.  The rivet (which was never closed to hold the clip) fell off and I found it on the floor."
I really like it but it looks like one corner is already coming loose and I just have it for two weeks.<br />You can see the pictures and compared with the other corner and see what I mean.
This is the second time I've ordered this phone case which shows how much I really love it! Very fashionable 💁 the only thing I wish is that the material last a little longer. Other than that loveeee it and the prices are awesome and free shipping 😊😊😊
Bought this for an old iPhone 4.  Case is slightly too large for the phone and the antennas came off within 2 weeks.
"Best case I've owned.  Two problems though that marked it down a star, ordered the blue border but got gray/black and took so long to be delivered I almost forgot I had even ordered it."
great
"As described, great price and fast shipping"
Do not buy these. They sound terrible
Fits perfectly and comes off pretty easy. I love the Speck cases but hard to take off. My only issue is the there isn't much of a bump or cushion to protect the screen from getting damaged if it lands face down. Other than that it's a great case.
"I love to change cases frequently and I am very picky about my phone cases. I like them to be thin not bulky. I received the Fab Quality Clear Galaxy S6 Case. I love it. !!<br /><br />So easy to put on and it fits nice and snug with my phone. I like that you can see my phone back and nothing is covered. It is so thin and makes my phone look as if it has no case on it. It is comfortable to grip, it does not feel slippery. I have had others that were for a iPhone 6 and the quality  was not as good. This is strong yet flexible. Precise Design Allows Easy Access to All Ports, Sensors, Speakers, Cameras and All Galaxy S6 Features. Designed Specifically for Samsung Galaxy S6 2015.<br /><br />I will be using this case for a long time because it is so comfortable. I received this case complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own."
"The case is wonderful, I get compliments on it all the time . I tell them I got it on Amazon. It's working out excellent for meI would suggest anyone buy this type of case if you carry your phone in your pocket"
Ordered for my son to use with his iphone in his Honda Accord. He likes it and hasn't experienced  any problems
"Breaks too easily,will never buy again. Looks cool but old drop and the wood stripes away in long chips"
"Great product, works perfect. Delivery was fast. I'm thinking about getting another for school"
Works great
"Not bad, the back case material is too slick and the case is a bit bulky.  The kick stand is a nice addition but not enough to overcome the slickness of the case.  I went with the Incipio instead and it was half the price."
"They are comfortable and unlike most earbud style headphones, they actually stay in my ears and don't hurt. They are great for running."
Great portable Charger for the money!
"Barely fits the phone, seems to loose. The stylus is hard to get at and for most audio jack applications the case needs to be removed."
"So after a misunderstanding on the package i received, and the fast response from the sellers customer service dpt.. i tried the screen protector. There are a few things wrong with the product i received.. 1... the glass doesnt fully cover the screen part of my phone. I understand that it isnt supposed to go to the very edge of the phone, but this doesnt FULLY cover the actual screen. There is about 3/4 millimeters where i can see the original screen. 2... the adhesive doesnt fully adhere all the way to the edge of the screen protector.. there is like a halo around the tempered glass...  If this changes after a day or so, i will update my review on this part. 3.. It is kinda sticky to the touch. Not smooth like your screen is without the protector.<br />I do have to say the Customer Service department was very fast to reply to my concerns, and they did everything they could to help me out. Sorry guys, i tried it and this is my honest opinion. I have had better tempered glass protectors.."
EXCELENTE PRODUCTO
No exactly &#34;light weight&#34; but it's powerful. I love that I can charge it in the sun. It came in very handy when I found myself in the dark suddenly on a beautiful (& cooler) day when someone ran in to a pole and knocked us all off the grid.
"TOOK A LITTLE LONGER THAN EXPECTED, BUT THE CASE WAS DEFINITELY WORTH IT.  THE CASE GIVES MY PHONE A MORE STURDY LOOK."
It works as expected.
"Hard shell that protects phone well, but maintains the slim profile. Phone sits comfortably in front pants pocket without feeling like a block of wood."
"exactly what i was looking for, not too bulky, good protection.  fits my needs at a great price!!"
This product is awesome! Charges all of my devices very fast. I love it!
Congratulation for your team.
"I bought this for the Honor X2 made by Hauwei. It arrived before the scheduled date so the shipping is expedient.<br /><br />The case also comes with a screen protector. That is good in case the one already on the X2 becomes damaged. Be sure to look closely at the X2 screen, it comes with a factory installed screen protector so don't add another on top of it.<br /><br />The back of the case is real leather, a sample patch is attached so you can see that. I noticed that the corner of the leather back near the camera cutout was peeling off. It isn't a big deal to put some glue on it but something the manufacturer should pay some attention to.<br /><br />To install the case. slide the leather cover downward so that you have two pieces, the back and the metal surround. Insert the X2 with the side buttons portion going in first followed by the opposite side. Then slide the leather back cover in. The case does what it says and is very stylish and provides a nice grip. It makes the X2 look very high end.<br /><br />Here are the issues though and for me it is a deal breaker sorry to say:<br /><br />1. Any case will increase the bulk of a phone but with the X2 aleady being on the large side, the extra bulk is just enough to make it too large for me to carry around. It isn't that it doesn't fit into pockets, it still does but it just is a bit too large to hold. I don't say this is the fault of the case, all cases will make whatever they hold larger. Just keep this in mind. If you use the X2 differently, say carry it in a purse or something like that and primarily use it as a tablet instead of a phone for making calls, that extra size is just a bit too much.<br /><br />So #1 applies only to me.<br /><br />#2 though is hard to deal with. I noticed that the X2 gets better reception without the case than with it. I use T-Mobile and can consistently get very fast 3G speeds, so good that for practical purposes, 4G isn't any faster or doesn't make a real life difference. Perhaps itis the metal used in the frame but the instant I take the case off the 3G reception gets much better. I don't know where the antennas for the X2 are placed but this is something I noticed.<br /><br />I must say though, since the Honor X2 is designed for the Asian market, this reception issue might not happen in locations where 4G works with the X2. Since I am using the X2 in the USA and get 3G service with it, that might be the problem. If you are in a location where the 4G frequencies work with the X2, then you might not experience this problem.<br /><br />In summary, I chalk this up to 1-personal preference and 2-my location which is not where the X2 was designed to operate. I point these things out because some people like me are buying the Honor X2 for the US market.<br /><br />I rated it 4 stars because the design of the case is nice, it is well made except for that one small issue which could be isolated to my one example."
"Though delivery took a while, the case fits the phone very well, providing good protection without the bulk of some cases."
"Just as described, no defects whatsoever! Will buy from you again!"
It does protected but it doesn't look like is for the Note since it leaves a big gap after installing..
"These are great for my fitbit charge, and arrived amazingly fast!"
"The cover is good-enough for my wife's HTC Desire 626, but it wasn't exactly what she wanted. The feel of the back cover was a little too smooth and the whole case was darker than she thought it would be. But it fit nicely and I would have been happy with it."
It was alright
It works well for me being a trucker it gives me all the shortest routes
Received the package in excellent condition. The batteries have worked great so far.
Purchased as a gift - husband uses frequently!
The case showed up in a timely manner. Was exactly what I ordered and has a really great feel to it. The little kick stand that allows you to prop the phone up works great and was something I didn't even know I wanted. Would reccomened great quality and product.
It's a very good case for the money.  Bot an extra glass piece and replaced the plastic front.  I am happy with both.
EXCELENTE
love it
"The case is snug and pushes the volume button all the way down, so I cant use the item :("
love it.
"Very pretty, like the card holders.  Happy with purchase."
Works just fine good quality
It takes you the long way around. Pretty much of the time....<br />I'd wouldn't sell it to my worst enemy!
Havent dropped it yet but for the price im surprised by the look and fit. Looks and feels more expensive. Hopefully it stands up to a good fall.
"The case is nice but when I received it, it was broken"
I used it for two years and loved it. Now my 12 yr old son is using it. Worth the money!
Happy with the purchase especially the price 4 dollars
"I bought this case trying to enhace the cosmetic aspect of my Iphone 6 Plus, i was using a magpul case before this one and let me tell you it looks gorgeous.<br /><br />Top notch quality but be careful when taking off since it looks fragile too.<br /><br />Very good buy IMO."
"My first thoughts was that this case is great, until the lock that keeps it shut snapped off.. Haven't even had it for a week yet.... The worst part is that I read all the reviews before I bought it and knew other people had this problem, but I still bought it anyway...."
"Needs to improve touch sensitivity, when i press for voice notes rec. only about 8-9 sec. Even pressing really hard."
only worked 2 weeks
Save yourself expense and frustration down the road.  You don't find stronger and more reliable cables for less money than these.  The braided nylon jacket prevents the normal cracking and breaking of the wires near the Lightning plug. These cables are strong enough to allow you to use your device while it is charging.  The added length is also a welcome addition to the standard 3 foot long cable. I liked them enough order more than one. Highly recommended.
Great quality case for a great price. For a case like this at a mall you would pay SO much more.
They fit perfectly for my two year old and she loves them.  I only took off a star because they are still a bit loud.
Stopped working 3 months after I bought it.
Great product.  Fast shipping.
Good and cheap. Not super grippy.
It fit nicely and worked well.
"Despite the item description, this case does NOT hold an iPhone 6 Plus with an Otterbox Defender cover on it. Wasted my time. I paid for one-day delivery as I really needed it    Update: If you have an iPhone 6 plus with an Otterbox Defender case this one works great. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NTURFJ2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
Horrible. Scr
yes
Love it
I like it fine just is more peach than pink
"I have had this product in my phone for about a week now. Like with any battery, you want to set it up for its lifetime by getting it a full solid charge before using it in your phone. With my original phone battery, within five hours of idle time in my pocket it was at 40% battery. This battery averages to stay around 85% idle time in my pocket within five hours. I am not a very heavy smart phone user on the average day, but when I do use it, I use it a lot. So far I can say that I am thoroughly impressed with the improvement of the battery life by purchasing this product. If things change within the near future I will update this review accordingly. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is having battery issues with their S5."
Shipped fast. Description was accurate. I'm happy with purchase.
Great price wife is loving it.
"Should prob go back to R&D with this one.  Seemingly ok at first. The top of the plastic which gets locked under the plastic clips can easily be pulled out at the corners.The waterproof seal for the bluetooth button is not water tight. needless to say, stuck my Iphone in this thing, and few minutes later it was in a plastic sealed bag half filled with water. Had that &#34;I told you so&#34; feeling loosing the vacation pics. Just get a dedicated camera for water activities."
"What a great little unit.. Ordered this for my father in law and we used it over the weekend.  I used a laser rangefinder and he used this.<br />It was spot on.<br /><br />PROS:  Superlight, accurate, small, easy to read, user friendly<br /><br />Cons:  no slope meter... thats it!<br /><br />Loved it... I almost want one for when I cant see the hole... thats when laser is useless"
It's just really hard to take off if I need too. I guess that's a good thing lol
"Delivered quick, works good, picks up a lot of sound according to the person on the other end. Easy to use but wish it had more options (higher volume and battery readout) but for the price it's well worth it."
case has been great! i have used a similar product from noot with my s3 and that one is still in great condition! really like their products. light weight and durable!
I want to meet the engineer who designed this device..... Maybe he can explain me how to use without pain in my ears....too cheap to be good...
Great case! Fits perfectly even with a tempered glass screen protector. It does add bulk to the phone but makes it easier to carry which is a huge plus :) Lime green is a fantastic color.
Very happy with this purchase. Teen driver now has hands free and can even use this speaker with the GPS on her iPhone. It's small and sleak. She loves it.
"Love this case! Fast shipping with prime, the case fits perfectly and is tough enough for my lifestyle."
"The battery Works Great.<br />The tools I needed came with the battery,<br />Was very easy to replace."
Poor sound quality people on other end of call could not hear me speaking...I guess you get what you pay for
This case works very well! My daughter enjoyed taking underwater photos the day it arrived.
"Purchased 2 of these cause they stated they were Adaptive Fast charging for my Note 4. Plugged them in, no notification that the &#34;fast charger connected&#34; came up... after about 30 min only charged 6%. An &#34;adaptive fast charger&#34; would of charged at the least 30-50% in a 30 minute span. My original has the adaptive fast charging logo on it. This one did not. Returning for refund."
"I love this case,is really useful and really good quality, it's been 6 months and still working like day one I definitely recommend this product."
Best case I have ever owned. Completely protects your phone from breaking due to shocks. I have literally dropped my phone a million times and this case does not fail at keeping me protected. Sincerely thankful.
Thanks :-)
I bought thos battery in hopes it would last longer than the original one with no such luck it is just as bad. It doesn't hold up any longer. My phone has been off of the charger less than 10 minutes and I'm already down to 89%.
Complete junk. Didn't last a full day before the clip came apart and the case doesn't fit the phone.
Fits perfectly
Not good I wouldn't recommend.
Pretty...perfect fit...i like it thanks
"Says its compatible with finger print scanner but it's isn't. Does not work, not pleased with this product."
"This case looks amazing and fits perfect, but is not very comfortable.  There is a premium look to this case.  It is fairly easy to put on and take off.  The back has a good grip to it.  The problem I had with the case is the aluminum sides are not very comfortable while holding."
This item was exactly as described.  Price was best I could find.  Shipping was quicker than expected.
This cable worked well on our nook.
Works great
Made a squealing noise no matter which channel it was on
Great cable. Gets the job done.
"Wow, I did not expect a perfect phone in every way. Perfection to the detail. All the papers, sim card etc were included and I can not tell you how impressed I am with it.<br />Thanks soo much."
Overall a good case firm fit very thin only drawback is that when the back side of it is squeezed against the back of the phone (it always is bec of firm fit) it creates  a smudgeyy kind of  look very unappealing.
Doesn't hold a charge
"Not sure if I wanted a wallet type case, but after using it, it is the right choice.  Good protection for phone, feels great in hand and looks great.<br />Still have to open it to receive a call, but then can close it and keep talking.  Also works well in car with voice recognition."
It didn't work waterproof seal didn't pass the test
"After a few months, it stopped holding it's charge, so I went back to my old, more dependable GPS."
Great item....beautiful! Thank you!
great suction
What can I say?  Anker's products are top notch.  I'm using this to charge my iPhone 6+ as well as to power my dashcam.
"Great case! Especially for the price! Compared to the phone cases at the Verizon store, I saved at least 50%"
It lasted quite a few drops... finally the case died :( all the fastners broke off.  does get dirty.
Love the custom option here. Fast shipping too!
"First  I need to say that I only bought this camera about a week ago, so this review is only a first impression. The Good: 1) Video quality is very good and the price is more than fair. 2) Long power cable 3) Good suction cup 4) Auto start when you turn the ignition ON 5) LCD display that allow you to view the video and play back  The not so good: What I don’t like and think it might cause issues in the future , is that the camera getting very hot when you touch it, which make me believe when the electronic components inside getting to hot , and this is not something that can survive for a long time (Time will tell I guess) and this is hot regardless of being on the windshield in the California sun. 2) The recording loop option only good for 1,3,5 minutes. I wish it will have the option to record all the way with no limit straight until the card is full and loop recording from the beginning when the card is full 3) the worse part about this camera is the window reflection that I wish was not appearing in the recorded video . I mounted under the rear view mirror which is perfect location from the view angle , but the reflection from the window  is a BIG issue which I really don’t like.  Would I recommend it ?  Yes but for the simple reason of price and video resolution. It’s a very basic camera that will do what you looking for in events driving recordings."
Awesome product. Kids in back seat can charge and use your phone!
Nice feel.  Quality construction.  Strong magnet keeps inside case in place in the wallet.
"As described and highly recommended... A little shy on the edges but I understand why. It fits fine with an Otter Box and probably would with any protective case which fully wraps the bezel. The product arrived with a holographic seal and I feel quite comfortable purchasing from iMacket who not only cares about customer service but offers an excellent customer experience. The glass installed flawlessly on my Note 4 without any bubbles or halo whatsoever. - Nice job! iMacket has obviously taken the steps to implement great quality control throughout design, materials, manufacturing and packaging... and I truly appreciate that. - Thank you!"
"Love it. I have the previous version as well. The smaller footprint, and light were great improvements."
Was not impressed poor pitcher quality
The mesh on the front part where the speaker is started to fall apart after the first day of using it. I just slowly unraveled day by day. I hoped that after a while it would stop but it never did. The buttons on the side are also impossibly hard. Eventually I returned it for a refund. I think there is a reason Otterbox discontinued this case.
greatcase
"[[VIDEOID:8f2c0fde0be1db3383e7e976147064ad]]**4/16/16 IMPORTANT UPDATE TO MY ORIGINAL REVIEW**<br />After owning the LG G4 H815 for 10 months and absolutely loving it, I am sorry to say my phone died suddenly.  A few weeks ago out of the blue it shut down, and when I tried to turn it back on it starts to reboot, then dies, then starts to reboot, then dies, etc.  Some research online confirms this is a common problem with the LG G4 (called a &quot;bootloop&quot; problem), so common that the company has publicly acknowledged that it is a problem with the phone's motherboard and loose connections between some of its components.  There is nothing the user can do to fix it.  It must be repaired by LG.  They will repair phones under warranty under certain conditions, but NOT for the H815 model if you purchased it in the US.  This H815 phone is an international model that has no warranty when sold in the US.  LG has refused to repair my phone and I am stuck with a $500 loss after 10 months.  I would absolutely advise against purchasing this phone if you live in the US.  If you live outside the US, I would contact LG to see if you will have any warranty coverage before purchasing.  It is a real shame - such a great phone, but with a fatal manufacturing issue that renders many of the phones dead within 6-12 months.  Please search this problem on the internet and consider carefully before buying an LG G4.<br />*************************************<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />The LG G4 is an incredible phone.  It gets so many things right - big but not too big size, expandable storage, replaceable battery, tremendous camera, high quality, thoughtful user interface - and very few things wrong.  My video won't hit everything, but here are some highlights.  Feel free to post any questions in the comments section, I'll answer to the best of my ability.  Great phone!"
"after the second use it stopped charging via the sun. And since I didn't use it immediately, it's ineligible for return.  Fairly useless as solar products go. Don't buy it."
Great cord. Everything I wanted at a great price. Shipping was fast too.
One of the coolest things ever for your car perfect wish I would've known about this sooner
I bought them for my 67 hear old mom & they're great. She loves them.
works very well and is a perfect dock for both watch and phone
The corners don't stick
"I've had this case for over a year and its been on and off my phone several times. I only have one little crack on the pink border in the front. Easy to get on and off but very sturdy. I know if I drop my phone, I'm not going to have a cracked screen."
this is an awesome idea and product - perfect placement
works great
"The handle has already broke and it looks like good quality on line, but it very cheap plastic. It worked for a couple of weeks and the art is very cute, but not at all a good buy."
"Not happy !  Put battery in phone, charged battery, put phone on nightstand next to bed & did not even use & had to recharge less than 12 hours later. Recharged again with same result."
"Really enjoyed this case! The quality is good and the color is nice, but the purple shade is a little bit different in person. Other than that, everything is great! The only thing that would make this better is if it had a wrist strap."
Thank you
"Fits like a glove, Very classy minimalistic flipcase."
Do not purchase this item it is a waste of money. Brought it from seller only used it a couple times. The ear piece broke in two pieces. This is reconditioned junk..
excellent
okay
Works very well. Workmanship is pretty good - but not excellent.  Well worth the price.
excelent
"Purchased for the GPS for vacation to the Northwest and used the GPS in Seattle, Mt. Rainier, Olympic National Park, Victoria BC, and Vancouver. We are very happy with this GPS. The directions are very accurate and the traffic alerts are very helpful. When there is traffic ahead, the traffic alert will notify about the traffic and potential alternate route. Got updated maps from Magellan and it took about 20 to 30 minutes to update the map.  Minor complaint is that the GPS unit connects to the satellite a little slow when the power is turned on. So you will have to wait a bit to get signal."
Broke after 2 months or so.
Product got very hot while charging. will not recommend buying this item.
it's ok
Dropped it once and it broke
COOL GROOVY AND FAROUT
Cheap product and not worth any star in the evaluation
one of best all in one  would recoomend it<br />better than expensive brand
"Fantastic case, the hot pink is a beautiful color. Great customer service and received quickly ! Would definitely recommend to friends."
"UPDATE 9/27: CHANGED REVIEW FROM ONE TO FIVE STARS.<br />Tech Armor reached out to me and gave me a replacement protector with one day free shipping. I have not applied the new protector yet, but will update when I do.<br /><br />This is the second screen protector I have purchased from Tech Armor and both have not worked out for me. Both of my protectors have not completely adhered to my phone. The top corners aren't stuck down, so there are ugly half moons at the top.<br />Attempting to get a replacement from their site tells me &#34;sorry, but this happens.&#34;<br />Will not purchase again, I learned my lesson."
Such a lifesaver on trips and when I'm camping!!!
Love the case and ETA was earlier the stated. Do will order from this seller again.
Please with the product.  Dropped the phone a few times and it has withheld the drop and kick test.  Great!
it broke already on the first day. good thing it was free :)
Just what I needed
Thank you I love my case
Has already cracked after 1st fall. I just need the cover now but have to order the whole set all over again. Price is ok but poor quality.
"Cover is okay, it gets dirty pretty quickly."
kit is eay to install
"Got this for travel and it worked very well. Was able to charge 2 devices without problem,and the 2A port does charge devices quickly."
This is great case to make a rugged manly phone look more girly. My only complaint is taking it on and off for use by the pool and with an armband to workout. The outside part of the case is very rigid and can be difficult to get into place. Instructions would have been nice so I know if I can use it in the water without risking mold and damage to the phone. My best guess is no because the material of the phone is made to repel water and the case could hold water in.
"The texting is really annoying, however it is a great little phone for basic needs. I killed my my more costly smart phone, and find that not paying data and just using the basic features is really all I need."
Use it all the time. Much better than the windshield suction cup.
"It fell apart, within a week. Lack of proper gluing. I am wondering if it was a &#34;knock-off&#34;, and not OME?"
Love it! This is my charging box for all my devices.
"Small, portable product for a great price.  Huge plus, the battery lasts a long time!  Use this product daily."
"This is perfect! We recently bought a kayak and have been spending lots of time on the water. I wanted something that was convenient, waterproof AND that I could take pictures through. This fabulous pouch fit the bill perfectly! It fits around your neck via a lanyard, seals tight, and is definitely waterproof. It made me feel so much better to have this with me while on some of our kayaking trips. Below is a photo that I took while on the kayak, with the phone in the case. As you can see, no problems whatsoever! I love this!<br /><br />This product was received either at no or low cost for review and inspection purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review."
"I hooked theses up to a old MTX thunder 250 amp. They sound awesome! Clean, clear sound. Would have given 5 but I wish they had more bass. Great for the money."
Nice case. Fit well.
USE IT EVERYDAY
doesnt charge at all
"So original, so cool, i love it!"
Like it
works perfect. does the truck for me!
No issues. Went on easy and stayes clear.
Charges my Note 4 2.5 times and can jump start a 4 cylinder car instantly.  Great job!
Cute!  May daughter loves it.
As described. Fast shipping.
great product-fast shipping!
"The case fits well, feels very solid and is easy to hold on to, and the built in screen protector works well.  It isn't quite as easy to put on as the video (which is the only installation instruction, a link is provided for it but no printed manual).  For a phone which will be riding in a pocket, likely dropped many times, it should be well protected.  The screen protector is plastic, not glass, but is clear and smooth.  If it does wear out, it shouldn't be hard to replace it."
Well made and works great.
Looks good and protects well.
"Nice protection, not bulky, and with a stand-up strut, too."
"Used this for the first time today, and it was beyond perfect...<br />Exactly what I needed! Kept things simple :)"
Works well.  Have put it through the paces and it's solid.
The real deal!
Did not fit my phone securely especially around the point for recharging phone.
I love the case I bought for galaxy grand prime. Its perfect.
Excellent Case.. my only idea would be to make the plastic screen cover insertable / removable. If you already have a screen saver on your phone the other screen saver does not play well with it. It creates what I call the bubble effect. I am not inclined to tear up either one to fix this problem.
Cables were exactly what I expected.  6 ft length is a plus.
snug fit on my iphone 6 plus
very pleased with this case.
provides all around protection to iPhone 6 and a great price.
Have a few of these. They are much sturdier than the iPhone cabels and last much longer
Perfect arrived on time my husband loves it
Met my needs. I don't have to carry a wallet anymore.
I originally ordered a milti pack and really was happy.  But most recently the 6 foot no longer makes a tight fit and I have to play with it to get it to charge.  sometimes I get up in the morning and my phone is dead because it quit charging during the night. I will need to contact them and get another.  but overall they have worked fine.
simple and effective.  magnet strong enough to hold through a spigen case on iphone 5s
item received broken.
I like it alot! Some slight static but I'd you turn volume up on device that you are playing music from it goes away. Variety of stations to choose from if not getting good signal from a particular station. Like th remote and digital displapy. Easy peasy  to use!
My daughter is very happy with this product. She has taken underwater pics several times with no problems.
Better than expected by far
I especially like that it will charge multiple phones more than once. It sure beats my old dinky thing that only gave me an extra 20%.
"I like it because it has a perfect price, a good quality and IQ technology."
Just what I wanted and it arrived quickly.
"So I bought this at the best buy store.. Anyways this a great phone guys.. It's really quick, it rarely lags I have the 1gb version but its more than enough for snapchats, Facebook and more. Camera is really good in bright scenarios, at night not so much. Snapchats look amazing on this phone I was honestly impressed. And the built quality is great a bit on the plastic side but feels solid, the screen is bright. You don't need more than 720p it looks great to me and it helps the battery a ton although it takes awhile to charge. So make sure you charge before bed, but the battery lasts a lot. It's a great buy! It does more than enough for everyday needs and more. Im cla college kid whos always on the phone abd im telling this phone is amazing. Definitely recommend anyone, even if they are not on a budget."
"I love this case, I'm watching for it to go sale again. My brother inlaw wants one."
It works but it has to be under the sun while charging good for camping on sunny days
Could not hear it at highway speeds.
This case is awesome. I love it. The quality is great and the look is very sleek. Definitely worth it!
"This works great, until you try to readjust it. Then the protector cracks. Overall if you can get the screen on well in one shot I recommend this, especially since the protector has a good 'feel' when on."
"Love it, it just needs a place for  a stylus."
Did not work on my IPhone 6 so I basically waisted my money. But only rated it 1star for this reason only.
It was what I expected it to be. Work fine
"I love the fact that this charger has 6 ports on it. Between tablets and cell phones, we just didn't have enough outlets in the kitchen where we wanted to charge all of our devices so they were easy to remember to grab on our way out of the house each morning. This guy does them all and only uses 1 wall outlet... and all 6 devices charge fast. I have a Charger Doctor device that displays the voltage and current being delivered by a USB port, and I've had the charger loaded up to where it is delivering more than 1 amp from each of the 6 ports (6 amps total) with no problems. I've recommended this to my family and I know they are going to love it as much as I do."
great item
"The only criteria that this product met was that it's full coverage, all of the other claims are wrong. 1. It's not scratch proof, I have not even had it for one day and it has scratches already. 2. It has bubbles all over the screen, and I followed all the instructions. thank you stealing my money EDIT: So as I wrote up here I had problems with my screen protector, but the costumer support contacted me saying that It was most likely product with factory flaws, so they sent me a replacement, and they were right, the replacement they sent is flawless, I loved it (: it fits perfectly."
I love it. There was a little difficulty adjusting the ban but that was because I didn't look at the instruction illustration. Once I did it was easy to figure and install. Locking the clasp can be a little tricky. You have to make sure the first part is hooked and snaps in properly before the second clasp will lock in place. Once you get the hang of doing it there's no problem.  Definitely gives the Apple Watch a much classier look than the rubber sports band without having to pay the higher price for the mesh style.
Very happy with the quality and sound! Great value!
Use it everyday
Works great.  Very sticky surface.  Hopefully it won't leave a residue on my car dashboard but will need to leave it for a while in order to be sure.
"The LG G fits works very well and I am very well pleased.<br />The only thing was I do not think the account was not wright when I got visa bill.<br />I would like somebody check and make it wright . This whole think started because I had to return the first one , not the one."
This is a very good one but i recieved a second hand one<br />When u talk is a little hard to understand the person in the phone but to listen music is cmvery nicee and adjusts very good in ur right ear!  I would b happier recieving a brand new one
"So I've used screen protectors for as long as I've been having a smartphone, bought one for each of them, at least 7!<br />This is by far the best one, their service is also amazing. I dropped my phone on hard concrete and it saved my screen from cracking.<br />Highly recommended"
"UPDATE:  The reply to my original review implied that I could contact customer service for a remedy. I did. And not only was the respondant seemingly unable or unwilling to look up my order or review on their end, but after sending several polite emails with all of the necessary information for them, I've apparently been blown off. Glad ya'll wasted my time with your sh!t warranty. I woulda changed this from 2 stars to 0, but I'm stuck giving 1. Was great when it functioned. Purchased mid-June. Battery is now totally dead. Won't charge or power phone. Thankfully, still had my old one."
it works great!
"This cover did not look good when I got it.<br />Once I put it on my phone , looks tremendously awesome. I love it and other people ask me where I got it.  I have not dropped my phone so I would not be able to tell if the cover will handle a good drop.  Will update in a few months about the case"
Worx.
Perfect and good
Love love love this case!
As everyone else has noted the holes dont line up for the corner brackets. Its not worth the cost of returning but hey it was a $15 screen so what are you going to do? Personally I installed it and redrilled the holes to make the piece work.
Products as described and arrived very fast
Worked great
It works great for my Barned &Noble nook. I've been using it more than a year and there were no problem .<br />Good product with good price.
"Decent case... I've had this a couple time... they last me 4-6 months.  There is a button on the top, and the opening for the button makes the case weak in that area... It eventually cracks and I have to replace the case.  I've bought cases from other manufacturers as well, and the problem seems to be more with the design of the phone than the case."
Good
"The absolute first time the phone was dropped while using this case, the screen cracked. I would not recommend this case to someone. The phone fell maybe 3 feet onto the floor, it fell flat, screenside down, and the whole screen cracked. The case also feels very cheeply made, the rubber that covers where the s pen is and the charging port is very flimsy and it feels as if you could easily rip it off. This case does not offer appropriate protection."
Excellent case.  Very sturdy but light weight
Wifey here. I got a coupon for this so I wanted to leave feedback in return. This is a great little device. It plugs easily into the car and has two USB charger slots. Does exactly what it's supposed to do. I may get another one for our other car.
Awesome! Charges my Note 3 very quick.
Works great so far.
Nice
Was not what I expected.  Thought it was a glass protector with hard shell. Did not like it at all.
exactly what I wanted and is slim enough to fit in my purse
I bought this and it didn't even last 2 weeks. The plastic covering on the cord pulled off exposing the inner wire. The inner wires then began to fray and I had to move the wire a certain way to get it to charge.
"My daughter loves these and they fit comfortably on an adult head as well. Quite simply put, these are the best Bluetooth headphones for the price you will find anywhere. The company also has excellent customer service and makes their kid friendly approach very apparent. I suspect that if an adult purchased these headphones they would not be able to beat them for the quality and comfort at this price point either. After nearly 8 months of being used every day these still look and work as if they were brand new. I feel comfortable highly recommending this product for children and most adults as well though if your head is larger than that of the average size of a 180 pound male, then they may not fit comfortably."
Looks just like original brand name LG.
Better than pictured.
"absolute junk.  The gripper/jaw clip thing is loose and when it actually holds your phone, it  presses into the volume keys and messes with audio.  Really crappy design and not useful at all for iPhones."
"I love them, thanks so much!"
"Amazing product! Never  scratched, chipped or broke the entire time I had my s5! I even gouged it with my house jey whike showing it to a friend and absolutley nothing happened to the protector or my phones screen!! If they made the same product for the Note Edge I would have purchased it in a heart beat. Traded a family member my s5 for the edge ... Miss the s5 because of this tempered glass protector.<br /><br />A must buy product!"
It was a gift for my daughter and she likes it
"does not work very well, dissconnect continiously, costumer service is great."
I love this headset cover!  It stays in place and is very comfortable around my neck. The price is good too.  I'm waiting for more color choices especially orange.
GREAT durable phone case!  I purchased three in different colors and my teenaged grandsons really like them!
Very happy with order. Came a few days earlier than when Amazon told me it will be deliver. Very happy customer.
headset has excellent sound quality with many features such as the stealth feature which activates noise cancellation to queltch the noise from extreme wind.

"I love it, it's perfect!"
Excellent quality... extremely happy with purchase
bad... broked easily
"does everything it is supposed to.  Keeps the phone secure on my dashboard, in my line of sight so I don't have to take my eyes off the road when using navigation or navigating music."
"Excellent product the sound is great! I specially like the bass definition, by the other hand I ware it to run out and gym and it´s quite confortable with good fit, I definitelly recommend it."
"Finally a charger that can keep up with the power drain of running my navigation software on my iPad Air on the boat. Even when starting with a full charge and charging all day, the iPad would die on a long day. While this doesn't maintain a 100% charge, the loss is minimal."
Didn't work
Broke where the wire and the adapter meet within a few weeks of owning.  Very poorly constructed.
This case fits my phone perfectly.  It was pretty simple to put on.  My edge functions are still visible and all aspects of the phone are still able to be used.  I wish the color was different but it protects my phone.  The case is still slim enough were I can put my phone in my pocket if I need to.  I received this at a discount to try in exchange for my honest review.
I can wear this all day.  Love the way this bluetooth fits!  This is my second one since I lost my first one.
"Led light is very useful, It shows charging, fully charged and alternates red and green when device is on and on the verge of being fully charge.  The longer cord is very useful, and the is much easier to plug and unplug."
Slippery case horrible
Works like the original my phone came with.
"Case was ok, not as protective as I was would like, but was not bad otherwise."
these super shields go on smooth and  EZ. but I really did not need 6 of them. although the price was great. I would buy them again.
works great.  going to take it on our 3 week vacation..
💯
Ok.
"They are not as rugged as the OEM products, but at the price they are disposable."
"VERSATILE AND VERY GOOD PRODUCT,  GOOD AND  CHARGE FAST MY ANDROID"
"Charge cuts in and out, charger is less than a month old."
Beautiful case super fast shipping faster than expected Thankyou for getting it to me love the case. iPhone 6  has fallen and it was protected got it for when my kids play games. Love it Thankyou!! A++++
Great for now.  will see how they do as time progresses.
"This mount is sturdy, adaptable & well-made; my Samsung Galaxy S5 fits perfectly.  Very pleased with this purchase."
Good protection except no rubber around edges.
I love this case! I accidentally dropped my mp3 player in the toilet. Thank god the cover was on it because it saved it from having water damage. It is completely fine! I would recommend this product to anyone!
"Virtual partner function is excellent. Sets it apart from the lower level watches. Great interface. Easily tweaked, has like 54 potential data fields I believe. Can be used for hiking as well with its return home function. Awesome system for pacing and tracking mileage."
Nice case but the belt clip broke in about a mont
Purchased this one for my son.  &#34;Most awesome phone case ever&#34; is his remark.
"Bought this after Studio Energy.... no update, no customer response. My advice no more business for Blu from me."
DO NOT BUY.  Doesn't work.
10000maH does not seem to be right. I could only charge a samsung s3 and iphone 6 at one go. And had to charge all over again. Barely two weeks into my purchase and it hardly has any charge capacity
"This phone holder is a great tool for me, because the mount stays firmly in the air vent of my note, I have many holder for phone, but this is a great one than others. I recommand this holder, I`m sure you will love it. And thanks for your gift, I give it to my son, he love it very much. Thank you, five star."
Great! Keep it clean and it always sticks firm.
very good case
I like it
Price is way to high
Very good price for certified cables. They work great!
This is so comfortable with my cell phone when I watch a movie or just for daily use.
Works great so far.
Nice case very slim I had an expensive Life Proof case before; I prefer this one
"I bought this charger because it was long and apple certified and from Amazon. However, I have had it for about a month and now no longer works because it is says it isn't apple certified which is the way it is described in the name of the product. I hope the company can send me a new iPhone charger because this one is no longer working."
Good product. Fast delivery
Purchased the charger for my husband. After 2 weeks it broke. The front unit popped out. Hoping this is fluke. I plan on returning it.
Really cute!
Fit note 4 perfectly no issues with this
Awesome case multi useful
"A great phone considering the price! Battery life is somewhat limited, but overall performance is excellent. The upgrade to Lollipop sent flawlessly and the phone has no other real issues."
This case fit my Moto E LTE perfectly.  Absolutely love the look and feel of it.
Just as good as the original battery. I always carry an extra battery with me and charge the three of them (these two plus the original) on rotation. It's an awesome feeling to go from 0% to 100% power in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />Just be ready for confused and jealous iphone users.
"Very efficient service, the part is exactly what I need, no complains."
Love the fit of thia case on my phone
Good for the price.  Quality good. Comfort good. Stays in place.
Love the looks and perfect fit.
"This case protects my phone great. I know it's not waterproof, and neither is the phone, but I dropped my phone in the river yesterday while fishing and the case kept my phone dry and my phone didn't get damaged at all. I'd definitely would recommend this case for this phone."
Bona fide FAST CHARGERS!  Too many sellers claim that their products are fast chargers but they're not what they claim to be.  THESE are the real deal!  I will definitely do business with this seller in the future!  Thanks!
work well although no instructions
Ok  phone I buy for someone
Works great! I love this phone holder.<br />This phone holder will securely fasten into your car vent.<br />I have a iPhone 5s with case and It fits perfectly!<br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
First time user.Fast shipping. Great multi used battery charger and flashlight all in 1 and easy to use.
I ordered mine and it has a sharp ring to it when I connect my phone to it and it won't stop no matter what station I set it too
Didn't work as I expected. Hard to figure out charging and back up usage.
I purchased several of these cords for my family. The cords are very sturdy. The length has become a plus when having an active child. He is always moving and really hard on electronics. This cords has held up really good.
Love my case
Nice case
"Does not work, camera wont focus. Additionally there were no instructions in the package. Look elsewhere"
Works as it should and seems really well made
"Reviewing cables is silly. This does exactly what you'd expect. It is a good build quality, not flimsy."
"Love my blue. I can say this phone is all studio blue saz it is. The extras are fantastic to have.<br />I ditched my high end android.. For this sleek beauty.. And happy I did.. Hats off to you studio blu ,keep up the good work.."
"Works perfectly. It's been dunked in water, chewed on by a baby, and dropped on concrete just about every day. My phone is still in perfect shape. I will never buy another type of case!"
"Nice, high-quality wire & molded connector design.  Very flexible (although I assumed it wouldn't be because of its appearance in pics).  Highly recommended"
"If there is one accessory that I think all mobile users should have it’s a USB charger for their car. I personally have three that I keep in my car for various road trips. The first adapter I had only had one port. It was very helpful, but as the need has grown for more ports and more power behind it, so has the market for car chargers. Accessory designer, TYLT, has come up with a rather unique device, the Y-CHARGE [QUIK] Car Charger. It’s a charger that is designed to push more power out to larger devices. For example, the Y-Charge [QUIK] has a 4.7A high powered output. That’s enough power to charge two tablets at their maximum rate. In addition to that, devices that support QuickCharge will charge up to 75% faster than with other chargers.<br /><br />The Y-Charge [QUIK] is also a ‘smart’ charging device. This is a newer class of products that senses your device’s power needs. The charger will then provide the maximum charging rate that is designed to charge your device with. This is very helpful as you don’t have to worry about overcharging or inserting your device’s USB cable into the wrong port.<br />I’ve been a fan of TYLT for quite some time now and have owned many different car chargers. But, I’ve never seen one with such a unique design. As the name suggests, the charger is a ‘Y’. The power adapter end that goes into the cigarette lighter is just a bit longer than most of the other chargers I’ve used. It’s ‘Y’ junction splits into two ports for USB charging. I’ve used other TYLY USB Charging products and found them to be of greater strength that other chargers in the same class and feel that the Y-Charge [QUIK] is no different.<br /><br />The only issue I have with this special charger is its size. And, this may just be because of my usage, but my main cigarette lighter sits just in front of one of my drink holders. Any time I am charging something, it gets in the way of a drink that needs to sit in that holder. This is a very minor issue, but one I felt I needed to address as others might have the same consideration.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful product with a very unique design.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review. I am a technology journalist and pride myself on providing fair and honest reviews. Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.&#34;ry minor issue, but one I felt I needed to address as others might have the same consideration.<br />All in all, this is a wonderful product with a very unique design.<br /><br />&#34;This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

"I am a pretty big power user of my cellphone and it barely lasts a full day even though it is pretty new (Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge), I love my phones ability to charge wirelessly and thought it was about time I got a new battery pack to charge it when i travel without having to have cumbersome cables in my pockets etc.. so I bought one of these. First of all WOW makes life much simpler once i worked out that you have to switch the wireless charging on and off :) (light RED led on, wireless charging on )<br /><br />For a device with 10000mAh it is pretty compact in size and is constructed to a similar standard to most cellphones in that it may or may not survive being dropped on concrete but I am not going to test the theory.<br /><br />Also, using the accompanying cable allows me to quick charge (at 2.1Amps) 2 other devices that use either Apple port or USB. This worked great on a long flight when I had forgotten to charge my iPad.<br /><br />Basically this works great!"
"Previously I was one to spend $10+ on a glass screen protector, but when I went through them every couple months I decided to go a cheaper route. I spent $5 on this phone case and it is honestly works just as good as any $10 screen protector. I think I actually prefer this one more! I will continue to buy this screen protector. This is a good product and it is money well spent."
"It's entertaining, not frustrating."
Fits my iPhone perfectly! Very happy with this purchase.
"If want to use your smartphone as a SatNav in your car then some sort of mount is essential. Unfortunately although there's a wide variety of universal phone holders on the market a lot of them aren't very good. Most use a clamp design that can be awkward when fitting or removing your phone and many aren't very stable and tend to vibrate when driving. Build quality can also be a problem with many falling apart after prolonged use.<br /><br />1byone have gone with an innovative design which consists of a small magnetic disk which pushes onto any car air-vent via 4 rubberized fingers. This proved very easy to fit and stays in place very securely.<br /><br />Secondly you get a choice of two magnetic plates depending on whether you use a case on your phone or not. There's a round magnetic plate that sticks directly onto the back of your phone, or a larger rectangular plate that sits between the case and your phone.<br /><br />As my phone has a case I went with the second option and as the plate is very thin it fitted nicely between the layers of my dual-layer case. Once you pop the case back on you'd never know the plate is there - until it jumps into place as it gets close to the air vent mount.<br /><br />My phone is on the larger side but the magnetic bond had no problem holding it in place. There were no issues with it slipping off while driving although it would sometimes rotate slightly to the left or right. The phone remained stable while driving with very little vibration.<br /><br />Attaching and removing the phone couldn't be quicker or easier, and the mount's rubberized coating prevents any damage to your phone or case. When not in use the small mount with it's discreet 1byone logo matches in well with the look of the car dashboard.<br /><br />Overall I was very impressed with 1byone's air vent car mount. My previous phone holder is a clamp design which sticks to the windscreen but this is much more convenient. If you don't use a phone case then not everyonewill be happy to stick a black disk to the back of your phone but if you're willing to do so then this will work very well. For case users there really is no downside and as it's well made and very inexpensive I can highly recommend it."
"Realized after I bought this that it was for an android phone, stupid me. So I gave it to a friend and he told me the lighted cord only lasted for a week...maybe a fluke?"
"Great in theory, but doesn't work well enough to rely on. Gets really hot and only charges my iPhone 1/3 of the time. Also very slow."
Great wire I am using mine to put with my portable charger battery pack.<br />Works great no problems so far.
Another great product.  All ports in use and all my devices charge at their fullest. Just killing it with quality mobile accessories.
Broke after a week
The backing is made out of a rubber material that rubs when I run
Now it solved my problem of selfie or asking strangers to use my phone which was un-safe from get go.<br /><br />Easy to setup and now I go everywhere with this selfie stick.<br /><br />I plan to buy for gifting to some close friends.
"Arrived quickly, so I was able to get my phone working without delay."
Fits the phone perfectly for charging
Good for the price
Fair.. Not as good as I thought it would be..
Nice size
love it
Great product...great fit<br />When I look at getting another I sure will look at this seller first.<br />Fast shipping
The WeFix website had many tutorials.  It took some time but I was able to fix it.  There was one small piece which I couldn't figure out but I saw it in another video on the website.  After that everything went well.  The phone looked and worked good as new.
Good product .
"love it ,perfect for what its needed for"
Super fast charging and it looks great.
Great solid mount in our lexus is350 also holds a note 4 in a shock absorption case well designed!
"Broke the first day I had it just from putting it in my pocket. I didn't expect much for the price, but I expected it to last longer than a day."
Sucked
Bought it as a gift for my sister.  She loved it!
"I bought these to replace the factory rear 6x9's in my 2008 pontiac G6. They sound so much better and i'm just running the stock head unit with no amp. I've been a Polk guy for over 20 years but couldn't find any that had the bass i wanted according to all the reviews i read unless i wanted to drop an additional $100 , which i did not. So after reading up on these JBL's i took the chance and i am glad i did. I can only imagine how great they'll sound when i get the amp im saving up for installed."
Awsome phone for sis no scratch crack or dings
didn't fit the phone that I had bought it for. They advertised the wrong product.
Great shipping time and product exactly as described.  Great product.
Battery works great.
This is a great item.  I use it on a daily basis and it has not let me down.  Very sticky... sticks to my phone case... and the material is great for fitting a few extra cards in there.
These cases are great!!  They last a long time and don't show as much wear as some others.
"Absoultely perfect. the included install guide makes this super easy to install. Comes with everything needed to install: clean, dry, guide, and holder.<br />A+++ I got this at a discount for my honest review but even full price is good price for the quality compared to other brands. All my comments and feedback are my own opinion.<br />Any questions I'll do my best to answer"
Doesn't work!
"This works well with any smartphones, I have IOS and android and I don’t have any problem synching them with this receiver. It has Perfect audio transmission function no unnecessary noise whatsoever. It’s very convenient USB port for charging smartphones, GPS, and other devices working with USB charging.."
Even though it takes a long time to arrive I really liked the case it was just what I wanted thank you.
As other people mentioned in their postings this fits great.  It is just a hair thinner than Apple's bands but so far I have really enjoyed wearing it.
"Bought 3, missing one cord!!!!!"
"Very handy and useful, just took a while to install but after that its been smooth sailing."
"This scanner ROCKS!been using it for overs month now and I am extremely pleased. Get a different antenna though. Other than that, love it!"
Ever since i first tried these i have looked back since. They are slighty sponge-ish so when it takes hits itll mark it but never damage the screen. Just peel off and apply another. Fantastic covers.
I ordered an IPhone 5C case I got an IPod 5 case.
These are the best! Super sturdy and truly waterproof. Tons better than my current case.
Crap. Waste of hard earned money!
Easy  to hold & charge the watch.
Thank you
BEST ITE******FAST SHIPPING*******A+++++++++++++
"Good smartwatch, like the fact it has built-in gps. Its definitely a little bulky but is fairly thin. Seems pretty well built but the band is a dust magnet and there really aren't to many options for replacement bands. http://www.amztracker.com/#a_aid=56604032da0ac"
"This is the best case that I have ever had for my IPhone period.<br /><br />The features I like:<br />* The kick stand is a really cool feature, great for watching you tube videos.<br />* The outer edge is made from a rubber like material, making it non slip.<br />* the clip on cover has a velour material that covers the screen further protecting it from scratches.<br />* Lightweight<br />* low profile, easily fits in my front pocket even with the snap on cover.<br /><br />If you want to protect your phone then you need this case. Just get a third party screen protector and you will be all set.<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like is the kickstand is a little hard to deploy when you first get it. As you use it more it gets a little easier to extend."
fit perfectly and a good value
"I received this on time and its great. I went on a long trip and used it. I have an iPhone 4 s a BLU Android phone and my husband has a small flip phone, it worked great on all of them and I also had a blue tooth I charged on it."
great item at a great proce...
"I really feel like it protects my phone. Over the weekend I went to a soccer game and had my cleats and my phone in my bag. Normally I would have been nervous about this, since I throw around my bag a lot, but with the case I was fine. It even started raining, but I knew my phone would be safe in side the case. It does do fine with stuff like rain and water being run over it, but it can NOT handle submersion. The water just went in through the zippers. But overall, it is a good bag as long as you are comfortable with the fact that it's not waterproof.<br /><br />The seller graciously gave me a discount so that I could give you this honest and unbiased review.<br />-Thomas Burgess Review"
A great help in tracking and motivation!
"This was exactly what I wanted, fit perfectly on my phone, and came super fast!"
Love it
"Works well although not the highest voice quality when speaking.  Another nice thought would be for this to come attached to a phone holder since most people use one anyway. Then, you wouldn't have to stick it on the dash somewhere."
"It works as expected. I have an Anker battery pack and have been very pleased with it. Before I purchased the battery pack Anker was not a brand I was at all familiar with. After purchasing this, Anker has become a reliable/ dependable name to where I feel comfortable purchasing any of their products without any hesitation.<br /><br />The overall build of the charger is strong. Even though it's case is plastic, it is sturdy and will take a good beating. With most accessories that have a plastic case it feels brittle and hollow. This is solid, it does not feel like there is a tiny little circuit board with usb sockets on it wrapped in a case three times the size of the circuit board. the pins on the DC plug are hard. It takes a lot to move it out of position to loose continuity in my p.o.s. vehicle."
"I had another case from amazon on my phone but it was getting worn out from a year of use. I bought this one because of its look and thought it would be made the same as my other case.<br /><br />I dropped my phone from 18&#34; and the screen shattered which cost me $130 to get it replaced. I would never recommend this brand to anyone, the case is not slim, it is bulky and does not look near as good on the phone as the stock image. DO NOT BUY"
;)
Awesome
I really love my Fluance setup; sxhtb with bookshelf speakers but this subwoofer is not up to par. I am going to try a few more different RCA cables then a different receiver and maybe try just running it from the fronts but I just cant get it to sound all that great. The lows are barely there and if I turn it up it sounds muddy as hell. I have had a lot of subwoofers to compare and this is pretty disappointing ...If you are looking at this vs the polk psw10 go with polk. I like a little more punch to my bass and it just not here I am going to keep trying variations and will update accordingly but as a main sub I feel unsatisfied
It's working properly as describe. I highly recommended this product to everyone.
I love it !!
Excelent! !!!
Fits great
My daughter loves it
Big Bulky and flaky.
Good quality.. And provided good protection..
"I spend a huge amount of my time listening to music when I am working out, cleaning the house, or working in the yard. I own a ton of different headsets, but I honestly think this is one thing that you can never have too many of.<br /><br />These are a really pretty bright green color that I love, especially since this shade of green just happens to be my favorite color. The cords are very vibrant and eye catching, so I love wearing these when I'm going for a jog in the evening if it is going to be getting dark while I am out.<br />The earbuds are comfortable to wear and stay in place while I am moving around.<br /><br />As far as sound quality, I have to say they are pretty good in my opinion. I'm not a person that is super picky, but there are great for my needs.  I found I can turn the volume up pretty high and there is a minimal amount of distortion. Keep in mind you do have to adjust the volume from the phone or MP3 player, there is no way to do this directly from the headset.  I received a pair to review, and enjoyed them. While I do prefer Bluetooth headsets overall, these are a really nice pair of corded earbuds. Good sound quality, fun bright colors, and enough volume to drown out the world. Thumbs up from me."
"Apparently they redid the installation process, so it was really easy to install.  Seems like a good product, but I guess I won't know for sure until I drop my phone."
Clear and effective. I like them
This works great.  It charges both my iPhone 5 and iPad 4 very quickly and with no problems.
"like most chargers online thye work for a while then break, but did its job for the meantime."
What a great sportband for a great price.  Would recommend to others
I got these for my husband for a Christmas gift and they stopped working in less than a month.  And I didn't get a 100% refund for a broken item but had to have a &#34;restocking&#34; fee taken out of the price!
Could not get it to work!  Wasted my money
Beware! it's not made for small arms
ripoff
I haven't tried this as a waterproof case and I don't want to after reading the other reviews. BUT I plan to use when we are going somewhere that it might get a little wet.. like the water resistance feature. Even snow when we go on walks. I can do that and feel okay. It is really thick and bulky though. I would kind of expect that though.<br /><br />*Disclaimer: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my HONEST review.
I bought the black for my black Apple watch sport. I love how it looks and protects my watch. The price is perfect and the quality is good. Very happy with the product.
"Cute case, however it did not fit my phone properly. Material was also a little on the thin side."
Decent.  Not OEM but a close 2nd.
I loved da watch although I wish i could surf the internet on it.
"NICE PACKAGE. THE INSTRUCTION BOOK HAD TOO SMALL PRINT AND NOT ENOUGH INFO ON PRODUCT, HOW TO USE, WHAT THE LIGHT IS ETC. GOT SOME INFO ON LIGHTS AND HOW TO CHARGE ON THE INERNET AT THE ANKER WEB SITE. I HAVE NOT USED IT OTHERWISE, BUT WILL IN THE FUTURE."
charges phone easily and effortlessly
"This fits the phone although not perfectly.  The problem is its bulky, stiff, hot, and uncomfortable to wear.  I wore it once and likely won't use it again."
"Perfect Product, Best price!"
"I purchased this antenna and recently was able to compare the ability to receive the marine WX (2 meter) channels with a Nagoya NA-771.<br /><br />The mag mount antenna was placed on the roof of a pick-up truck.  With the mag mount antenna I was only able receive 1 channel loud and clear and 1 other barily audible.<br /><br />The NA-771, which is mounted on the radio was able to receive 6 of the 7 channels loud and clear.<br /><br />I then compared the mag mount with t6he stock UV-B5 antenna ehich also out preformed the mag mount.  I wish I had compared the preformance earlier so I could return this worthless item."
"For me, the most impressive feature about this device is how quickly it charges.  I plug it in just before I head out for the 15-minute or so drive to the local metro station and by the time I arrive, my phone is fully charged.  Also, the second port has proven to be a surprisingly convenient feature. My wife uses her phone quite a bit when she is in the passenger's seat, so she keeps her phone plugged in while mine is also charging.  Of course, it isn't just capable of charging mobile phones.  I've used it to charge a bluetooth headset and a tablet with equally good results.  Finally, the compact design is great for maintaining the car's interior aesthetics as it does not become a hulking plastic eyesore protruding into the cabin.  All said, this is an efficient, effective device for what has become a near necessity these days, which is the ability to recharge our electronics on-the-go."
It's great having an extra long charger cord.
very good
"[[VIDEOID:643dca462e9a63b11b4fd427e1305850]] For the price it is great. I've had it now for about two years. It has seen the summer heat and -20F winter days. The internal battery is not really useful at all and fails quickly, but that wasn't a problem for me as I have the camera turn on and off with the vehicle's auxiliary power. It will also chew through maybe two micro SD cards a year, but that's because it's continuously writing to the card. Today I took it apart. I was surprised at the production quality, however the battery was bloated and had ruptured. I'm just going to replace it with an old cell phone battery and put it back to work.<br />I suppose I would give it a poor review if I had paid more for it, but for the price point it's great.<br />I have included a video of me reviewing a video using the included software (it is on the card, just insert into a computer and run the application). You can see my speed at the top and a google map on the side."
So impressed with this headset - insanely comfortable with a good load of soft padding that means I can take them off after a good few hours as if I'd never had them on at all - no pain.
Doesn't work well
Does not work with an Otterbox case on the phone.
As described
The male end for plugging into the device is too long. Doesn't stay in.
Saved myself from getting the apple band
"Great USB Hub! Small, sleek and perfect. Had no issues hooking it up. The two smart power ports charge devices through USB quick and fast."
"Beautiful very high quality leather case that fits my iPad Mini 3 like a glove.  Love the antiqued brown color - a nice change from the black accessories that I always buy and easier to locate in my bag.  Case provides very good protection for the iPad Mini, along with a glass screen cover that I purchased.  Highly recommend this product."
Most of us have probably been there before. You reach into your pocket to grab you phone and it takes off and goes for a tumble. Well we all learn our lesson eventually and need to find us a nice case to keep it safe.<br /><br />The Collen iPhone 6 case offers two layers of protection. The first is the silicone layer that covers the phone. The second is a hard plastic exterior to assist with drops and scratches and keep the silicone layer tightly in place. I do mean tightly. This is one of the tightest cases I have seen yet to have such a great fit.<br /><br />I love these sleek cases. They keep the iPhones footprint as small as possible to squeeze it into your pockets yet still add a nice protection to it.<br /><br />It also comes with a kick stand on the back to keep the iPhone upright will watching a video or such. That feature has won the approval of my son. This part worries me a little. Every time I have an item with a small plastic kick stand the plastic brace always seems to break off like it did on my iPad recently.<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
"love it, what a great value"
No seriously waste of money don't buy this! phone i got this phone it sucks! its slow and the camera is blury and wow! the keyboard is off! dont buy this okay just dont buy this its enough android s***ty! phone
it charges fast
Love the length and it works great!
Waste of money
"It looks so cheap, hard time putting my iPhone inside"
"Stopped working after a month. Go with Anker, this product is garbage."
This is an awesome case. Everything that is said on their website is true about it I especially love the feel and how slim it is.  Great Product looking forward to my next purchase and color.  They should offer a red case as well just a thought.
"Very good,<br />I bought one before and is excellent, thats was the reason because i bought another to gift"
Piece of crap.  Already not working and I bought it 3 months ago.
very good just don't feel right on the ears.
"I have this for some time now, i love it. it charges my galaxy s4 very fast .And i just love that it has a flashlight!<br />It also seems very strong and durable.<br />Definitely recommend this."
Good case
good product
Didnt work. Charger didnt fit in hole. Sent back for replacement. We will see.
great product Glad I got it on Amazon for cheaper!!
worked well for the price and the amount of times I used it
"I've used a few cases for my galaxy note 3 but i've never tried a soft rubber case that felt as quality as this. the rubber is fairly dense and can stand up to a fair amount of abuse, specifically concrete. i've dropped my phone many times on concrete with this case and neither the phone nor the case received any noticeable damage. Another feature i really enjoy about this case is its ability to keep cool on the outside. my biggest issue with the note 3 is its tendency to heat up during extended periods of use, this case keeps the phone at a fairly cool external temperature making it very comfortable and pleasant to operate. The overall feel is good, the rubber feels dense, if i had to compare it to compare the rubber to anything id have to say it feels like a car tire, and high quality. If you like soft cases and want good protection for your phone this case is a definite candidate."
"I received the book within 2 days, about 5 days earlier as estimated by shipper. Awesome job and thank you!!!<br />Gleim is one of the best study guides and test-prep on the market, at least in my eyes. I used Gleim 15 years ago for my PPL  and I bought this book to study for my up coming review, to brush up on new and updated information on the ground and in the air."
Garbage
Awesome product
Love it although because of the band people think I have an apple watch
Is rubbish need to leave it charging all night so you can use it for two hours plus that can not be recharged in a car as it requires high voltage coriente.<br /><br />es una basura necesitas dejarlo cargando durante toda la noche para que puedas utilizarlo durante 2 hora además que no puede ser recargado en un coche ya que requiere de coriente de alto voltaje
"I really like this case. It's not bulky at all, it's slim and sleek. The case offers protection, great design and the sense of security knowing that your case is durable. It's simple to put on phone and doesn't interfere with plugging in charging cables or headphones. This case also comes with a kickstand built in the back. The kickstand is sturdy and does it's job. Not to mention, it came with a tempered glass screen protector and screen wipes.  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
Love this! I Have been using this holder for my IPhone 6 while riding my bike for the past 2 months or so. I ride on paved streets and crushed gravel bike paths and it works great..my phone stays in place solidly and is easy to use. I definitely recommend this product!
This is a great device to charge up to 5 USB devices. Traveled in Europe with it and only needed one adapter plug (no transformer!) to charge phones and tablets. It's compact size makes it even better.
I loved this case until a piece of the plastic case broke off. The plastic case broke in 2 places. It cracked at the earphone port and charging port. The gold coating is also rubbing off. This case is flimsy. I wouldn't recommend anyone purchase this. You are better off getting an all rubber case. Disappointed.
"Never did what it was supposed to do, I wouldn't recommend to no one😠😣😔"
It said it wouldn't bubble. It did.
I have had this product since June 2015 and it would not take a charge after 3 months. Vendor not willing to exchange. What a disappointment
"Arrived very quickly.  Was exactly what I expected.  Works well.  The only thing is you need to push a button to move the leg to the desired position which is fine, but if you do not push the button you could break.  After knowing this it is very easy to set to desired angle."
"Fast shipping, and love the phone case.  Exactly what I was expecting is what I got."
"power cable was intermittent, returned unit."
am very satisfied with my item. It was well wrapped and arrived on time.
Works for its intended purpose.
It was what I was looking for and exactly as expected. Can't ask for much more.
worked good for 1 yr then went belly up. no customer service and no one will work on it
Works great on my bicycle
"Awesome case. I love it. It really gives a more refined look to your phone, and meets all expectations."
"I work in a very noisy environment and I am able to use this speaker with confidence. I can hear the music over it well without noticeable distortion. I also LOVE how long the battery lasts!!! I work 12 hour shifts and I don't have to worry that this speaker isn't going to run out of juice while in use, an issue I have had in the past with other such devices. This speaker consistently outlasts my phone."
Excellent for the price super clear.
Pretty and everything but didn't fit like expected :/ kind of big.
"Charges my phone quickly and the phone senses it's a quick charger, it's great!"
"Excellent product. Great Sound. I bought it so that I could have something in the shower to answer the phone, listen to music and if I wanted watch Netflix and it works for all of that.It is made very well I definitely recommend this product."
excelente
This case is awesome. It has extra rubber protection around the corners. It also comes with a glass protector!
Dont buy...
Perfect!! Easy to use. Works great and will save $70-100 for an in store applied screen savers. Cool product. Everything you need to do a professional job.
Second Magellan purchased works great.
"I was surprised to see a charger included with the order. I thought it was just a coupla' batteries and ordered a charger to go with it....oh well. Anyway, I'm pretty happy."
Excelent 100%
"I'm somewhat disappointed with this Bluetooth. I had one of these before and used it for years with no issues. I bought it at Walmart. This one however cuts out a lot for no apparent reason. When working correctly it's good but that's not often. If your looking for a small Bluetooth, I don't recommend this one."
Excellent product and customer service -- I highly recommend this provider!
"I love the armbands for my smart phone.  I bought these so that I would quit forgetting to put it in the bag.  Now I have one in each car and one for the bag.  They are super comfortable.  The only part I have never understood, is that spot marked for a key.  I don't own a key that would fit in that spot.  I loved getting these in two days from Amazon.  I can start my week of right!"
Would recommend this item to my friends.
"Bought because of the holders to phone, wife took one for her a win win for both of us"
Did not fit the phone
perfect
Love it.
I love the product as it described.  Protect my phone real good.
Does not last long
"Screen still shattered with this case on, save your money"
"Work very well. Background noise is loud and I can hear my transcription easily. Unfortunately, I can not wear this type of headset long. The pressure causes head aches after long periods of use. I prefer the kind that hang on the ears, these are not as good for noise canceling. This probably isn't an issue for most people. Have tried a lot of head sets and this is a good set. I would recommend them."
Absolutely amazing! i love this product went to Universal and Disney and was able to charge my Iphone 5 both times completely charged with out me charging the device it's self. The product was charged when i recived so it was good to go! Would most definitely recommend to all my friends really great and perfect size to carry in your purse!
"i love this case because it's so cute! It fits my iPhone 6 Plus perfectly. I was aware it was plastic so it's a little slippery, but I love it so much! It actually got to me two weeks sooner which made me even more thrilled. I would recommend this to anyone who loves SAO too"
"This looks like it could be a good tool but mine arrived with two of the locks missing the feet that hold the screen down, making it mostly useless.  I returned this one and bought  [[ASIN:B011KF8UHS something similar]] for significantly less and while I'm happy with the replacement it has less usable surface area so it won't lock on to anything bigger than an iPhone6.  That said I use it for heating the screen module then I separate it manually with an [[ASIN:B00SERJQUG iSesamo]], which is one of the best tools I have for this kind of work."
Great way to protect your screen!
Fits perfect on the phone with the lifeproof nuud case.
It came before the date it said & it was what I expected
Really Nice
"Really love that it's clear so I can see the color and contours of my phone, and the bumper is enough to keep the screen cushioned without being too bulky. Haven't had any problems with getting the USB or headphone plugs in! Grippy enough to help keep the phone from sliding out of my hand, but not so rubbery that it attracts dust, pet hair, purse/pocket lint, etc. It's already got some dings and scratches where it protected my phone during uncharacteristically heavy use for me.<br /><br />Very nice option for a low-profile, unobtrusive Nexus 6 bumper!"
Belt clip broke already.  Sleeve that the phone slips in is very durable.
I love solar power and the ability to harness some of the sun's power to use for my devices. 
It was a perfect fit thank you....luv it!!
Fixed the ground hum when connecting an ACC100 FM radio transmitter to a mixer. Simple solution to a nightmare problem.
good job
Awesome case! Feels amazing and looks great!
Great
Super cute... Loving it!
this has been a life saver when it comes to having to &#34;charge&#34; as we are driving from point A to point B. The G'kids are much happier when their electronics are working and I am less bored if my iPad or Kindle is charged. Plug this into your cigarette lighter and you are setup 4 usb ports and 3 DC outlets. These inverters have a tendency to get hot but this model has a great little fan that keeps the temperature down. The cord is ample length but if the cord was slightly longer it would be PERFECT. [of course perfect length depends greatly on where the cigarette lighter plug in is located] I would buy again [it would be great to have one in every vehicle] AND I would recommend to a friend without hesitation.
Awesome deal awesome product
Excellent travel adapter.  Works very well in Europe.
Happy with it. I bought it for my husband who was always losing his phone but with the bright color he finds it fast.
Stopped scanning for WiFi and WiFi just sometimes work and sometimes doesn't.
I use this for my 2015 wrx and if fits perfectly.
"You kind of get what you pay for with this product. It's cheap but the sound quality and volume is very low. It also gets scratchy very often if you move the AUX cord from its original position, and the entire product itself can be very flimsy.<br /><br />It still works, but i'd rather invest in a higher quality one."
"I used this universal magnetic car mount to mount my Omaker bluetooth speaker to my dash for listening to my podcasts on the way to work in the morning. The mount comes in a nice little box with foam cut outs and extra sticky pads for both the ball and the socket/receiver.<br /><br />The socket and receiver has a really sticky reusable pad that can be removed and reused many times. The adhesive mount on the ball is more permanent but the kit comes with an extra in case you need to remove it and place it somewhere else.<br /><br />The magnet is very strong. It can easily hold my bluetooth speaker and probably something twice as heavy.<br /><br />The only constructive criticism I can give the manufacturer is I would like to see some sort of instructions included with this product, regardless of how simple it is.<br /><br />This is the bluetooth speaker I used with this:<br />[[ASIN:B00RBIC1IS [Best Outdoor&Shower Bluetooth Speaker Ever] Omaker M4 Portable Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker with 12 Hour Playtime for Outdoors/Shower (Army Green)]]<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful."
Going to reorder another for later! It is exactly what I wanted.
Garbage
"fits perfect. doesn't interfere with pockets and purse much. clear color lets me see phone, which I wanted!"
Works great w a bamboo charging station.
"The description of this item on Amazon.com is &#34;iansean Muset1c waterproof Wireless&#34;....<br />They arrived today and the instruction manual for the iansean Muset 1c says &#34;Warning:  Do not expose the headset to liquids.  Note:  liquid submersion voids the warranty.&#34;<br /><br />Um, false advertising much???"
"The case is koo love it, only problem (on my part) ordered the case for the wrong LG phone lol"
"Love this case, cheap but durable and cute! I've had mine for about a year and the only problem is the design wears off from where I have it in my scrub pockets."
"I ordered the CD slot magnetic holder for my iPhone 6. I don't text or take calls while driving, so this is mainly for GPS purposes. The CD in my car is positioned high on the dash so this holder places the phone within my field of vision while driving. Instructions are included, but probably not necessary. It's pretty easy to figure out. I have the Apple leather case on my phone and the magnetic strips they provided fit with no problems. The magnets are strong enough that I don't really worry about the phone falling off the mount. The only thing that I would say is a negative is that it's a bit wobbly. When going over uneven/rough road, the mount does shake. That said, outside of a window mounted holder or one of the grippy pads on top of your dash, this will be a problem for any CD/vent mounted holder. It doesn't detract from it's usefulness. Plus, it doesn't obstruct my view of the road. Is it perfect? No, but I give it a 4.7 out of 5, which I rounded up."
Perfect!
"PURCHASED AS A GIFT, SO THERE IS NO RATING FROM ME."
"I really like it , but it did not have the silver bird and that was a let down , because I was sold on one thing and received another"
Excellent Thank You..
Very nicely made hard case cover.  Makes the phone look more attractive and sleek.
Works as expected.
"mistake in communications, I asked for a case for the LG 3 - got the case for the LG2 - very small difference, but it did not fit."
Best buy for its money ! Came with screen protection film. Love it !
Worked great for my LG G3 screen replacement. No complaints at all.
"Love this case. Fits nicely and love the design, had a few people commenting on it saying they want one."
Excellent
Loved it
I couldn't get this charger to put my note edge in fast charging mode until I Googled and realized you have to make sure cord snaps into charger (push hard). It was charging but not in fast charging mode until that point. Now it's perfect!
"Worked out great, thanks. Mounted on three of my four phones."
"Being someone who LOVES taking pictures, I needed a tripod and have been searching for  the perfect one and so far this one is pretty good! It is small lightweight and compact. Being a adjustable makes it that much more top notch. It is well made and well worth the money especially if you are outdoorsy and love snapping shots."
"It was easy to place and looks great.<br />The touchscreen seems to more response with glass.  The company gives great support, if needed."
Doesn't work well on Samsung Note 3.  Extreme wide angle is barely more wide than the built-in lens.  Focus is very poor also with lots of Astigmatism.  The normal wide angle lens is not much better.  Save your money.
"I've only been using this device for a few days but I'm very pleased with it. It works perfectly on my Note 4 (with a qi receiver). It's very simple to use, basically just plug the adapter to device and then plug in to the wall. You don't have to figure out the sweet spot, just rest your phone on the charger. I highly recommend purchasing this AND it charges with my caseology phone case on.."
I bought one pair to test them out.  Turned around and order 3 more for Christmas gifts!  Best $10 and free Prime shipping I'll spend this holiday season!
"This screen is incredible!  I was so hesitant to apply the screen myself, thinking I would mess it up, but the company emailed me a convenient, step-by-step set of specific directions that were simple and easy to follow.  I had my laptop open, with the instructions on the screen, and in five minutes the new screen protector was on perfectly!  Great quality, great customer service!"
Cute
"It adheres easily to the screen , no bubbles . I like it !"
Love it.
Product was damaged already when it arrived. Also part was produced poorly because the screen adhesive was already peeling and coming off the display. Very unsatisfied please do not buy from this seller.
"I purchased 100 of these mounts to hold 7&#34; tablets for our company vehicles.  We were using the tablets mainly for a push-to-talk app in places of 2-way radios, so there was some pressure on the tablets from pushing the screen.  In less than the course of 1 year, 90% of the top and/or bottom bracket pieces broke in half at the bend.  Most tablets were mounted vertically, so the brackets were stretched out to the max.  If you were to place a tablet/phone horizontally, there would be less pressure on the tabs and they might hold up better.  However, we did not and almost all the bracket tabs broke.<br />I will say that this bracket is very adjustable and was easy to screw into the dashboard area of our vehicles.  The base is small enough to fit on lots of areas of the dashboard but it still wide enough to be very stable and secure."
Cord no longer worked after a few weeks without much use. It seems the wires got all messed up because the end that goes into the phone is loose.
Good product good nuff said
This is well worth the money.
I filled up the card slots with 6 cards and put phone in it and it wouldn't close. The magnet has now ripped off because I tried to stretch it a little and close it.
Not what I exspected
protects the phone against the hardiest/toughest of tests.  brutal ownership by teenage boys is not enough to thwart the magnificant protection of this beautiful and functional case.
I have not got to use it as of yet . I know that it is a quality radio . I'm working on my ham license .My Elmer told me that it was a good mobile radio
My husband really likes it. It seems to work well with his iPhone 6 plus except for the texting features I knew were likely not available
I HATE THE FACT THAT THIS THING ISNT DURABLE! ITS CUTE AND CONVIENT BUT DOESNT LAST LONG
great one i like it
this is one hell of a item i gain so many memories and even shared it with my brother who love to travel he took it on a trip to a huge water park in florida and captured a nice shot of mom and dad.
Bluetooth went bad in 1 month. Wire gone bad in 1 more month.
"The case was received in perfect condition, promptly and as promised. Communication was appropriate and professional. A good product and service for a great price!"
"Batteries are junk, shorted my phone out"
"I've reviewed dozens of DC chargers, but this is only the second one I've seen that offers four charging ports and my testing indicates it performs exactly as the advertising claims.<br /><br />I tested this charger using the same methodology that I employ in the testing of every AC or DC charger I review. Using a [[ASIN:B00KFS4Y1I USB Power Load Inducer and Tester]], I tested each of the ports and was able to maintain a 2.4 amp load on each port. I then left the load inducer on one port set at 2.4 amps while plugging in a Galaxy Note 3, S5 and ASUS T100 10 inch tablet, which I know from experience to draw 1.65 amps, 1.4 amps and 1.6 to 1.8 amps respectively. I allowed this test to run for fifteen minutes and encountered no issues with the charger.<br /><br />My test results show this charger to be a very good product. In this case, being capable of charging four high energy devices simultaneously; and at the price of $12.99 (at time of review) this is priced very competitively. I like it and until something better comes around, this is one charger I won't be giving away.<br /><br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟"
Frayed at the iPhone connection end in 3 weeks of nightly use. Pass on this one.
Love this case it protects and organizes as well as looks awesome!!
Very pleased with this product. Practically installed itself without any bubbles.  The feel is natural without loss of touch sensitivity.  Will be searching for this product for other installations.
"I have owned many HooToo and RAVPower products and when I came around to needing a multi-port USB 3.0 Hub, I saw the HooToo HT-UH010 model and was very interested so I picked one up.  I couldn't be happier with my decision, as this hub is awesome!  It has 7 USB 3.0 ports which you can use for any device, such as USB Flash Drives, Portable or Desktop Hard Drives, etc.  On top of that, it has 2 additional ports which can charge any smartphone or tablet (1 port is 1A and 1 port is up to 2.1A).  This is something you don't see on a lot of hubs... only the more expensive ones.  The reason it's nice is because you can save space on your desk since your hub can act a desktop charger too for a tablet and/or smartphone.  I often find myself charging my phone while having other data devices connected in the other USB 3.0 ports.  Aside from that, the construction of the hub itself is very solid for being made of plastic.  The ports have adequate spacing, LED indicators, and it uses the industry standard VIA Labs VL812 chipset inside.  I highly recommend this product and actually am considering buying yet another HooToo product... their USB 3.0 Docking Station for my laptop.  :-)"
"been using this charger in my car for a month now.  I constantly charge a galaxy s6 using gps, an iphone6, a Bluetooth streaming device, and sometimes an iPad. The unit performs perfectly!  I also bought anker 6ft usb to hide my cables. Again anker comes though"
Awesome watch for the value. It's easily customizable and definitely serves its purpose!!
"So I was reluctant at first to get this phone.  Though I got the best deal and price for it from amazon.<br /><br />First, the screen is amazing! The edge to edge screen makes it a lot better than any scree. And with the edge, 5 phone callers can be assigned in different  colors.<br /><br />Second, I like the metal back,"
"The cable didn't work. The charger itself worked, but the cable didn't."
Love the fun pattern. The case has proven extremely sturdy considering the abuse it has received from my young children getting a hold of my phone.
I received the universal bike mount and was very excited about my purchase.  It fit the bike and was easy to put on and works great.  Now I have a place to carry my cell phone when riding.  I would recommend the universal phone mount to a friend.
"I don't normally write negative reviews, but this stuff smells SO bad that I can't even use it after the first time. I bought it for work since I'm in healthcare and we're going to a tablet based system for documentation. I figured between patients I would want an antibacterial cleaner not just the 'iclean' I've used for years for my phone. I tried it out on my iPhone upon opening it and it just smells terrible - I had to use my other cleaner to try to get the scent off but it took 4 tries over about 3 hours. It smells like B.O. and honesty like feces. And others around you will smell it too - it's strong. I really would save your money."
It was broken when I received it in the mail :(
"Still using it, i should buy 2 more as spares"
i like the design but the volume was not loud enough for me. the headset last most of the day and the play or talk time is about 4 hours<br /><br />the recharge light is ok. the first one i had the red charging light was kind of dim
Cute and does what it says!
It works to charge iphone 6 but won't work with speaker dock with 30-pin... Disappointed.
I like this case a lot. It fits well and protects the phone. My only complaint is that I dropped my phone and the case easily dented. My phone was ok but the case has some damage but still functions.
This USB to Lightning cable is a nominal 1 m or about 39 1/2 in. long tip-to-tip.<br /><br />The cable is very resistant to tangling.  It has shiny white plastic casings and very pale grey soft plastic sheathing and strain relievers.<br /><br />It is compatible with Apple products and functions perfectly for data and power transfers both.<br /><br />NetSunDirect provided a cable for evaluation and review.
"Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for my honest review. Starting with the design, it’s made mostly of a matte plastic that feels really nice and is not slippery at all. There are cut-outs for both mics, the camera, the flash, the charging port, the headphone jack, the IR blaster and finally, the speaker. It comes in two separable pieces, one flimsy piece that fits the phone perfectly, then a hard shell piece that makes the case more durable and protective. Speaking of durability, this case is a great combo between thinness and protection. The corners are padded and all three buttons are protected, but still tactile; to add-on, the case is still fairly thin. The case does not remove any functionality and looks really good. Coming from an expensive Otterbox, I am very impressed with this case, they even included a stylus and a screen protector, with a microfiber cloth! Anyway, thanks for reading my review, bye!"
"Gorgeous, high quality band! I love it! Lightening FAST shipping too.  Highly recommend this product."
Nice
RAVPower charger is great. I have user it many times when going on long hikes and it powers my phone as well as my wifes phone without any problems. I love the availability of two high capacity charging ports. I also charges back up rather quickly with the included charging block and cable.
"Great price. It was clear for a few months but it started getting yellow, still worth it though."
I bought this charger for my move across the country and it worked well for the week I used it every day. I have used it maybe 3 times since then and now it doesn't charge my devices. I tested the cable and cigarette lighter with another charger and they both worked so I knew it was the charger. not really worth returning at this point but still disappointed with the quality as my $5 gas station charger has somehow outlasted this one.
Exactly what I wanted....fantastic item and fast delivery.
It's great!  The windshield mount kept popping off and scary the crap out of me!
Works as indicated. Great product. Charges cellphones very fast when installed on wires that go straight to the battery as I had on my motorcycle.
bueno!
great
"Very stylish and sturdy, and funny too."
"This is a very sleek looking band!  I was a little surprised that it required &#34;some&#34; assembly, as others I've ordered, didn't.  However, that is NOT a deal breaker in any way!  This band looks great!  I love the black color.  Show's up very nice against the contract of the watch rim.  Also looks good to match the watch face.  Simple to install and includes a tool to remove unwanted links.  All in all, a great replacement band at a REALLY great price!<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an unbiased/honest review."
Too much noise not good quality waste of money now need to buy different one
very good
"Fast set up and easy to use, Very high quality sound."
I like the overall design of the case.  The kickstand folds out from the case in an a-frame design and seems to hold in place well.  I would like to see a higher quality material used to make the case so it is a little more  rugged.
"I think it is B.S to charge over $6 dollars to send this back, when I paid a little over $9."
First off the phone never fit properly in the case. We had to jamb it all together and even then there was a gap around it. Then within a couple days the diamonds started falling out and finally the kickstand broke after about a month. It's a pretty bulky case as well.
Great product. It's sturdy and not bulky. I love the buttons to turn each individual port on and off. This is a great car accessory.
Bluetooth still in use still working only one problem I'm having with the Bluetooth it does not tell me who's calling but it doesn't matter still everything is A OK
Great product. Fit as expected. Better than some of the more expensive so called tactical pants as far as practicality.
"This product does not fit the LG G4, which it is listed on Amazon under the search LG G4. When I received this cover in mail I opened it and realized it doesn't fit. I intended to return it but decided not to due to the fact it would of cost more for me to ship it back to Amazon and have a new one shipped to me. Extremely disappointed."
"Love it. Fit perfect, color is great."
Have to be careful to assemble on the dock station.
"Love this phone, came in great condition and works fabulously!"
It does not meet the specifications are not against fingerprinting
"Beautiful Case. I ordered the incorrect size. Display shows like it will fit a iPhone 6 plus the new phone, but it doesn't."
"Works as described, really tidies things up on the counter."
Great item fast shipping
"This mount is excellent. Easy to use, stays in place without any slipping (about two weeks of use at this point), and could clearly accommodate most types of phones. Highly recommended."
Good Protection
its not superfast charger but it is a fast charger
Great case!! Sturdy and efficient!
this is strong enough to hold an iphone 6 with a battery case (mophie)
Did not charge!!
"This is a really well made little device!  I got this specifically to use to hold my iphone6 plus while filming video so I've tested it on several surfaces so far and the suction is fantastic and holds really well - much better than the tri-pod I had been using which was designed for camera use.<br />As you know, the iPhone6 Plus is a heavy phone so many of the holders just can't keep the phone upright but this Osomount 360 Grip is REALLY sturdy and doesn't tip over!<br />While this is sold as a car mount,  there are MANY more applications of use possible with this such as :<br /><br />+++Attaching to a lap stand for watching movies on your phone<br />+++Sticking to a kitchen counter top to hold your phone to read recipes while you cook and<br />+++As a holder on the desktop for use with an external, bluetooth keyboard<br /><br />Those are just SOME of the uses I've discovered for this so far!<br />I was offered a promotional discount on this holder so I could try it and give my opinion  and feedback and I'm really glad I bought this!<br />It's turned out to be one of the most helpful devices I purchased in a long time!<br />Hope this was helpful info for you :)<br />Enjoy!"
Works great
My teenage daughter loves this!  Great value!
A great investment for a lifetime of protection.
"Great color leather, holds cards in well (I've never had more than 2 in a slot usually one), stands the phone up at a good angle for viewing, love it."
"Just ridiculous material,  you are paying for nothing"
Went to Europe over the summer and this case was perfect!!! Held up extremely well and I was gone for 6 weeks. Recommend if u are traveling.
"Doesn't charge the iphone 5 when on the Bose speaker. Sometimes works, sometimes doesnt for playing music through the speaker. Not that great."
I LIKE THEM !!!
"The phone case was beautiful but I did not get a strap for the phone as pictured on the screen if you can,can you plz send me a strap for the phone case,  Thank you !"
"Just what I needed! Sometimes I want a low shot, and my tripos doesn't reach the ground. This is PERFECT for that!:) I would definitely buy it again!"
WORKED AS PROMISED AND DIDN'T NEED TO BUY A NEW PHONE OR PAY TOO MUCH FOR THE BATTERY
"Was a tad loose, but otherwise live it"
"works and does its function, great case"
"Fit well, easily fit, seems to be all good. Won't know until it gets dropped!"
I love the longer length and it works well
Great quality.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you cannot use the case as a stand like many other similar wallet styles.
good product
"doesn't really fits the screens I have, knowing that description said it does !!!"
"Good goggles without the frill of the later versions.  I have not compared to other cardboard goggles, but I would guess these are relatively high quality lenses, with plastic frames instead of cardboard.  I did not have any problems using them.  The lack of a visor to block outside light was not an issue.  I did feel a little carsick, though.  Because of the carsickness, I do not regret the lack of a headband.  My arms do not get tired from holding the apparatus for the short periods I feel comfortable using it.  And it feels more natural to be holding it to your face while turning around, rather than relying on a headband to hold cardboard against your face."
Perfect case for the edge +. Very impressed with the construction
Perfect. Exactly what I ordered shipped fast and priced fair
Product is very good and satisfactory.<br /><br />This seller's items are always welcome.
"I have dropped my phone shortly after I purchased this screen- it cracked into multiple pieces, but the most disturbing fact was that my iPhone 6 screen cracked even more beneath it!!!"
This is the BEST phone case I've ever had.  I should have gotten one in every color.
Great product
easy to install.  check to be sure your cord will work with this inplace.  some won't
Very low quality and unbalanced structure.
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! Constantly breaks and comes apart. Absolutely no protection for the phone at all!
Cheap quality
"Finn is a fantastic product for mounting your phone to your bike. I've been cycling seriously for fitness, commuting and travel for over 30 years and there have been so many exciting changes in cycling technology in that time. One of the most exciting and most recent has been the ability to use a smartphone as a cycling computer. Finn is the simplest, easiest to use, and best solution I have found to mount my NEXUS 5 to each of the three bikes I ride. I have used the Finn for months with no signs of wear to it or my phone. While I originally thought the Finn might break my phone in half, it really does a great job of holding the phone very securely without applying damaging pressure. It is very easy to read the various cycling all's I have used as well as other apps like Google maps for turn-by-turn directions - a real joy on camping trips in new places! My only problem with the Finn is that I lost my first one and had to live without it for a week. There are other solutions out there. Many are more expensive, require tools, add weight, leave plastic mounts on your bike and/or phone, can only be used with one bike, cause your phone to overheat, etc. Finn is the way to go."
Good case so far so good
Bad ass amp JL audio can't go wrong with them
Awesome for the beach!
"Lasted just over 30 days before they stopped working.  If you are a runner, don't buy these they are pathetic."
like this
"Placed on phone quickly, perfect fit, nice color.. seems very sturdy. The price is right"
Good case but takes awhile to charge back up and makes a whining sound while charging the battery pack back up.
"I like this phone case because it's very sleek. I hope that it is shock absorbant as advertised, seems a bit stiff. otherwise great product."
This case has proven itself to be completely waterproof. We went kayaking down river and my husband was using this case with his iPhone 5s when he got flipped out of kayak. He lost his phone in the case because it did not float. In a little less than 24 hours we received a phone call stating the phone was found and it was working because find my iPhone gave them my number to call. The phone sat in case under water for almost 24 hours before it was found and still worked perfectly when we got it back. The only con is that we should have bought a floating wrist band to attach to it so it would not have sunk. Very thankful for this case for keeping our phone dry.
It was really easy to communicate with them about your design. Came verrrry quickly; considering getting one for my bf's iPhone when he gets one lol
"It broke 2 days after receiving it, the glue started separating"
Love this thing. So glad that it works with my phone :)
I replaced a leather band with this strap and very happy.
"I received a sample for review and here are my thoughts:<br /><br />This is by far the smallest headset I've ever tried and it works quite well.  Range is decent, sound is good on both ends of calls, and the ability to plug in the other ear is great.<br /><br />It came with a plethora of ear pieces of different sizes and styles and several ear hooks if you don't like using just the ear piece (I found it works best with the swivel hook).<br /><br />The call quality is good (almost on par with my Bose in-ear headset), but the stereo is a little lackluster.  It isn't bad per se, just a little tinny and lacks punch.  I wasn't really expecting more though from such small headphones.<br /><br />I think the ability to convert them to stereo is what really sets them apart.  If you're looking for a single ear BT headset you can quickly convert to stereo for music and videos this is a great solution."
Worked perfectly keeping my failing Garmin GPS battery charging. Other adapters failed to do this.
NO GO!!!!!!!!!
Mounts securely to vehicle and increases range of radio.
The product is ok but I don't like the fact that it says USA Seller and it came from China!  I think Amazon needs to watch this more!
It works mostly but doesn't connect to the Garmin app and sometimes it just quits tracking you. Also stops if you don't move over a large area. Get something else.
"It has been a lovely case so far and taken a lot of falls. It is not as pastel like as it is in the picture, but I still like the color."
Looks great but is hard to keep clean only due to the color.
"Works great, doesn't slip out of CD slot, and holds the firm securely. Only problem in the cars I've used it in makes it difficult to see radio channel and time."
Came with parts missing
I love the CoverOn case for my Lumia 640 xl.  Looks and feels great in my hands.
"I simply recommend this to ANY iPhone/iPod users out there who fix their iPhones/iPods.<br /><br />I have used this tool kit for my iPhone 4 and my iPhone 6+ and has been completely helpful the many times I have used this product. Whether it be installing a new screen to just simply taking out the SIM card, this tool kit has done justice for me."
Good quality. My 11-yr old daughter loves it.
"only good if your phone won't charge like mine, honestly I just got this because my old galaxy s3 was my dedicated music player"
Nice speaker crisp sound with no distortion. Bought for kayak trips since its water proof but have not been due to inclement weather but I'm sure it will be awesome once out there
This cellphone is my best decision. I was comparing for a long time to select it and now I'm very happy for my decision
Can't use it to store apps and the other huge space takers on my phone.
excelente
"Loved my case it's made of a strong material and everyone has loved the design, thank you!"
I love mine fits right in my truck
Very good product only missing a screen cover
difficult to see in the sun and/or in bright light.
These cords are very durable feeling. They seem better constructed then the actual apple cord and because they are certified I do not get an annoying message when plugging in. Bought these to replace my APPLE product cords that didn't even last a year.
Just as it says it is. Sounds great. Easy install. Would buy again.
"I am a woman with a tiny wrist, so I was worried that this watch (or any smartwatch) would look ridiculously big on my wrist. It's a bit big, but I love it! I wear it pretty loose so my wrist doesn't get sweaty.<br /><br />I love the way this watch looks, feels and functions. It charges super fast, so I can wear it all day, charge it for a bit, track my sleep, charge it a bit in the morning and it rarely goes below 50% charge.<br /><br />I found a Star Trek: TNG themed watch face that I love and looks great in the low power, black and white mode."
This cheap version of a lifeproof case was a waste of money. Broke within 5 minutes. Would not recommend to anyone.
"Screen was in perfect condition, tools were good, and instructions were a bonus. Swapped the screen with little trouble, although I have fixed about 5 different phones for friends. I believe a novice can swap as long as you have a well lite area and some patience."
Exactly what was pictured and advertised.  Quick shipping.  No problems.
I am so happy that I got a PROMO code to get this item and leave a fair review.
Received the product quickly and it is as promised.  Works great and the magnet holds my Galaxy5 no problem.  The unit is compact and fits snug on my air vent.  Thank you!
"The sound is great for such a small speaker. It attaches easily and it doesn't get in the way. The controls could be a little more tactile (I have to stop and look at it to adjust the volume) but that's a minor complaint, all things considered."
"This case keeps my LG G3 protected from the outside.  It also covers up the t-mobile logo.  I don't use t-mobile for service and I don't need to flash their symbol around.<br /><br />The case isn't much larger than the phone itself.  It doesn't add considerable bulk, and you wouldn't really be able to tell I have a case on unless you look carefully.<br /><br />One downside to this case is it blocks some thicker ear phone plugs.  I had trouble with one set of earphones I use and had to take the case off in order to use them.<br /><br />I paired this case with a glass screen protector which I've been told does a superior job of protecting screens to the film one.  [[ASIN:B00KC3FMKI Tech Armor LG G3 Premium Ballistic Glass Screen Protector - Protect Your Screen from Scratches and Drops - Maximize Your Resale Value - 99.99% Clarity and Touchscreen Accuracy]]"
"Great case especially for this price. Soft case with a hard case feel. Case extends around bezek to protect the front, keeps the phone nice and slim, clear so you can still show off the sthle of the phone. No complaints from me"
Would not connect/sync with my phone or computer.  May have been a defective device.  Replacement is being sent today.  Hopefully this one will work.
"I haven't bought this, but it has all the features I was looking for- EXCEPT SOMEONE HAD TO PRINT NON-SENSE ON THE BACK. WTF is a &#34;Unicorn Beetle&#34; and why would I, a white, straight, American male, even think about walking around with such rubbish on the back of my phone. That alone is the deal-breaker. Please provide a quality product marketed to someone other than hipsters and 13-year-old girls. The case itself looks like some mil-spec hardware. What does that have to do with a Unicorn or a Beetle?!?"
"I don't usually leave reviews but I have to say this is THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CASE I'VE EVER BOUGHT! I much prefer to not have a case on my phone because they're either bulky and ugly or showy and don't protect. This case is slim AND gorgeous. I have no doubt it will protect my phone from nicks if I drop it. It's smooth but not slippery and the design is perfect. My only, Bengal complaint is that the outside lining tends to separate a bit from the inside design.. Maybe it's just the one I got... If they want to send me a free replacement I'd change it to 5 stars and be. A costumer for life! Haha."
Best phone case I've ever come across. It's so durable biut lightweight. Extremely easy to handle. I'm very pleased with this phone case. I'm thinking about ordering more in different colors.
Very Happy
The jetpack works great. I was disappointed with usb cord.  It was a cheap cord; got hot when used to charge so I got a better one.
Works as advertised so far.  I would buy it again.
This little speaker sounds great and worked perfectly for turn by turn audio directions on my bicycle. It's also great around the house!
You can't go wrong with this one. Really easy to pair with my IPhone 6. It expands way too long with a decent hold.
"I have been amazed at how great this has been for my phone. I took my time, followed the directions carefully to apply the screen.  I can't tell its on the phone, but I feel it has saved my screen unlimited times.  I think careful application is the key.  This screen has surpassed all the screens I had on my other phones."
Great purchase :-)
I bought this a few months ago and it still looks pretty good thank you muah!
"My boyfriend bought me this case and I love it (despite the blah look)! Charges up/is recognized faster on a Qi wireless charger than my boyfriend's LG G3 (with a Qi receiver attached to the back of his phone).<br /><br />A big big BIG CON is how it renders the audio port inaccessible. &#34;*** This wireless receiver phone case is designed to be used with original Apple iPhone only&#34; Yeah. I get that, but the OEM Apple headphones are Pieces of S. -.-<br /><br />Great charging phone none the less."
Product was as described and arrived on time.
Absolutely love this case
"Love the case, it's tough, easy to grip and textured so you can hold onto it easily. The fit is perfect, not to tight that it's a fight to get it on or off. The graphics could be a little sharper, that's my only criticism.  Delivery was much faster than the listing said."
Takes way too long to charge.  It takes about 5 and a half without the phone in it.
Sound good but it said set of two but only got one :/ But amazing soind
Keeps my family safe from a lot of storms in my area along with giving me a weather report! Have to keep it on the charger to ensure usage after storms.
I have had mine for almost a month.  It's holding up great.  I would have preferred a more substantial wristlet.
Great case
"Thanks, UberZonClub.com"
"This shield works in a different way- it's a bit soft, abrasions vanish after a couple of hours, returning to smooth. As in self healing. The included misting spray is great for cleaning my glasses, thanks"
Absolutely amazing. Its very slim and doesn't interfere with any signals. It actually makes my phone seem bigger since its so slim which i love. Beats my otter box any day
It's so pretty and it gets rave reviews but it's the wrong one.I'm going to keep it and give it as a gift. I will order the correct one shortly. Thank you all
"Sturdy, looks great, takes a few days to get use to size. Nice product."
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
"Good cables are so hard to find (and afford) - and Anker has once again come through with a winner.<br /><br />This cable is of the same high quality, durability, and dependability of all other Anker cables. I have never had it fail to charge OR sync, and the connections are reinforced to the extent that I can see no decay in integrity in those spots close to the connectors that typically fray.<br /><br />Bravo, Anker - thank you for delivering yet again.<br /><br />(In the spirit of full disclosure, I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, yet I promise that my review is fair and honest.)"
Purchased as extras for travel. They stay packed with our travel bags. Will never forget phone cords again.Tthey match my phone and they work great. Very happy with purchase. Thanks!!
Works and looks great!
"I got this just to help with how slippery the Note 5 is and it definitely helped with that. The S Pen is still easy to get in and out, the bottom speaker is not obstructed, and the buttons still have that nice click to them. Also, there is just enough lip around the front to help if you drop it face down without making it hard to touch things with your thumb when only using one hand."
This was exactly what I needed to mount my cell phone holder to the dash.  They arrived on time and met my expectations.
"I wear it everyday and it does help monitor your activity and promotes a healthier lifestyle,,,,,,, however it does loose connectivity to the phone and misses activity you do so can be inaccurate when you know you have done more than it says. Principal is good but needs improving to be reliable."
"It's too big for my ear, and there's no way to adjust it! Very disappointed."
Broke after a week
Not as tacky (grippy) as I had hoped from the description. Still feels like good quality rubberized plastic and definitely thin.
excellent product!
"Perfect for protecting the iphone 6.  I was able to put my phone in with the Otter cover, perfect fit and gives you an extra sense of security to protect your  expensive cell phone."
"Very great buy!!!! Its definitely something worth investing in,plus an extra battery. Now my phone rarely ever dies (unless I leave my extra battery at home...lol). I travel out of town a lot,so whenever I do, I put one of the batteries on this to charge over night, then charge my phone,& simply grab it on my way out the door & place it in my pocket so I'll have it with me whenever I need it throughout the day. And it stays fully charged all day without me having to put it back on the charger."
"Very nice and cute, the staff also helped me change it to a six plus case!"
"stickers will not come off, leaves a blurred spot on your screen"
Very good
"Unfortunately, this didn't work out so well.  Bought it for my son and he says it doesn't stay on the phone, keeps falling off."
"This is a great backup charge and a convenient travel outlet. It does get hot but doesn't interfere with fast charging. I use it for my IPad Air, iPhone 6 and Kindle."
"I do outrigger canoe paddling and SUP and I don't do a workout without it now!  I love how I can have so much information spread over 4 screens with each screen being able to be split into another 4 sections.  All the info I ever need while working out on the water on my own or with the team.  I haven't even reached its full potential yet, but love how simple it is to use right off the bat.  Keen to pair it up with a heart rate monitor and add that info to my workouts."
Very durable and long enough to use while in bed and plugged in to a socket inconveniently placed just out of reach of the OEM cords.
"Perfect fit.  Easy to install, but be sure to use plenty of the spray when you install it. GPS is mounted on bicycle and has seen thousands of miles in all kinds of weather and screen protector still looks new."
"It's ok, I do Lyft & it does the job"
Great case...but when i clean my home phone button with awesome spray it touches lil bit of casing frame and all suden change color for that particular part
Love this. Wish it had a wrist strap but otherwise it is great.
"good, battery life great, software strong, speakers great"
Love it
Battery did not work. Purchased another from another retailer and worked just fine. Thanks
Product was perfect for what I needed it for. It protects my phone and is easy to get to. The product was exactly what was listed on the Amazon site and Wydan was quick on their response to get it shipped. Two days and I had it! Thanks!
"My son loves it, uses with IPhone 6"
"Great case, I love the strap and the magnetic closing, it is very secure. Inside there is room for 3 credit cards and money etc."
"WHAT A PIECE OF CHEAPJUNK!!!  DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL FUNCTION FOR LONGER THAN 6 WEEKS!<br />THE MICRO USB CONNECTOR ON THE POWERBOT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CHEAPEST OF IT'S TYPE I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE OWNED A VARIETY OF DEVICES WITH MIRCO USB PORTS!!!  IT STARTED AFTER ABOUT 5 WEEKS OF USAGE. AT FIRST, THE PORT JUST NEEDED A LITTLE BIT OF JIGGLING TO GET IT TO WORK. AS TIME PROGRESSED, ABOUT 3 WEEKS, THE CHARGING PORT CONNECTION JUST STOPPED FUNCTIONING. NOTE: SINCE I OWN A SAMSUNG GALAXY S3, WHICH IS RENOWNED FOR IT'S HIGH MICRO USB CHARGING PORT FAILURE, AND THE REASON WHY I BOUGHT THIS POWERBOT IN THE FIRST PLACE, I KNEW THAT THE BEST METHOD FOR PREVENTING MICRO USB WEAR WAS TO LEAVE THE MICRO END OF THE CABLE PLUGGED IN TO THE POWERBOT, AND UNPLUG THE STANDARD USB CONNECTOR FROM THE CHARGER WHEN NOT IN USE. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DID NOT WORK!  EVEN WITH MY EXPERIENCE WITH PREVIOUS MICRO USB PORT FAILURES, I WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN EVADING THIS ISSUE.  PLEASE CHOOSE ANOTHER BRAND THAT HAS A HARDWIRED CABLE AND SKIP ONES WITH A MICRO USB PORT. I ORDERED ONE THE OTHER DAY. IT HAS A STANDARD SIZE USB CABLE COMING OUT OF THE CHARGING UNIT. SO, I WILL LEAVE THAT PLUGGED INTO THE CHARGER AND JUST UNPLUG THE 110 VOLT CHARGER FROM OUTLET. (THIS METHOD ALSO WORKS WITH 12 v CAR CHARGERS) THIS WAY, I WON'T HAVE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT EXCESSIVE WEAR, AS WELL, ON THE STANDARD USB CONNECTOR."
This only works if you have a signal somewhere for it to capture and send somewhere where you do not have a signal.  If you do not have a good signal at your home anywhere... don't bother it wont help.  Amazon only gives you 30 days to figure this out before they won't allow you to return it.
This is a perfect stand I use it to copy from my iPhone to computer  etc.
This will not protect your phone if you drop it.
Great product and fast service<br /> Looks good on my wife's phone .
Really durable.  With toddlers at home this case will definately prolong the life of my phone!  Cute design too!
I-5 phone wont recognize these half the time
Really good one
It works as advertised.
Works great. It charges my iPhone and iPad faster than the conventional wall charger does. Most of the time I just use this!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a portable charger!!
"Remember those times when you're in the car... and your phone gives off the dreaded &#34;low battery&#34; sound? Remember that no more! The Anker PowerDrive 2 will charge your phone and tablet quickly and with the proper amount of power so you can be back to using them in a short time!<br /><br />The PowerDrive 2 has a exterior gloss finish around the sides, but on the front where you can plug in two charging cables, there is a matte finish. I do find that there is a problem with this, because as soon as I pulled the charger out of the socket, I noticed there were visible scratches on the glossy finish. Granted, there are somewhat sharp components in a car charger, but having a glossy finish which can get scratched easily is, in my opinion, not good design. A matte finish would be better design.<br /><br />Unboxing the charger was no pain at all, I love Anker's frustration free packaging. Plugging it in was not pain at all as well. However, when I went to pull out one of my charging cables, it pulled the whole PowerDrive out of the charging socket. It might just be that the USB connections are tight, or that it is a new product, but it still seems like a little flaw to me.<br /><br />The PowerDrive 2 also comes with an included Apple Lightning Cable, but since I'm an Android user I can't testify how good the cable is. But, judging by how pleased I am with my Anker Android cables, I will say that the Lightning Cable is probably a great cable!<br /><br />Anyone who travels in a car, or owns one needs to get this product! The charging speed you get on this charger is much faster than other chargers. The PowerDrive 2 is easy to use, it can charge two devices at once to ensure you and any passengers stay charged up.<br /><br />I've used other car chargers and this blows them away. Anything with PowerIQ will blow anything else away. Other charge slowly and sometimes not at all. With some other terrible chargers, I might get 1% for every 3-5 minutes. With the Anker PowerDrive 2, I get 1% for every 1-2 minutes, which is much better compared to other chargers.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really impressed with this car charger. If you don't have an Anker car charger, this one will work much better than your current one! You won't regret your purchase when you see how fast it charges. I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.<br /><br />Video Unboxing: https://youtu.be/unvlLyiIQkEive 2, I get 1% for every 1-2 minutes, which is much better compared to other chargers.<br /><br />Overall, I'm really impressed with this car charger.

"This little charger has been so convenient to have. Most chargers with multiple ports don't have enough Watts and Amps to properly power all the ports if you use them all at once. They can usually just power a few low power devices and only one high power device. However, the Swees 50 Watts 5V / 10A 5 Port USB Charger can power 4 ports at 2.4A if you need it. It can also power all 5 ports with 2A of power, which is more than sufficient for smart phones and tablets, or whatever else you need to charge via USB power.<br /><br />It's small, compact, and sturdy metal frame design. it's also lightweight, so it won't weigh you down while travelling. However, the light weight can also be an issue if you want it to stay in place on your desk or night stand. I ended up putting some Velcro on one side to keep it from moving around so much."
Good
Amazing!! Work great
"This case is awesome! The kick stand is so handy, when feeding baby or when playing movies on the go. It is also durable and for someone who is clumsy, it has been great when dropped."
It's good!!
I love this item. So safe and sturdy.
"I've only had the unit about three weeks, but during that time I've used it successfully on two trips keeping both an iPhone and gps charged.  If the unit becomes fully discharged, it takes 5 or 6 hours to fully recharge.  However, it does seem to hold a charge for several days standing idle."
"These earbuds were definitely not the right fit for me.  I used these headphones for running, and I could not find the right combination of &#34;wings&#34;, in-ear pieces, and over/under ear positions to make the earbuds stay secure in my ear while doing so.  Besides the fit, pairing, sound, and battery life were all as described, and worked as expected."
"Bought it for my kids. So far works great , no complains."
My daughter loves it!!
Just like the first one I had.  My son gave me a 2 in 1 that his employer used.  Kept looking for one like it but never found until now.  I can place them in different rooms and I always can find one when needed.
"It works just like an oversized Android phone. I love it! It also has Microsoft Word,  Excel, PowerPoint, etc... I inserted a 64g SanDisk memory card for extra storage.<br /><br />The only issue I had; I ordered a few protective cases and they were the wrong size. The size were for Galaxy Tab 8 which is totally different from the Tab A. The Tab A is much bigger! But it's cool 👌 I love it 💖<br /><br />If you decide to purchase it...enjoy! It's very fast too! Although it doesn't stay connected to the Internet for long periods."
"Charged up very quickly.  Haven't needed to use it yet, but ordered it especially for whenever power goes out as it can during our rainy season here in Florida.  I thought that Erika would hit us, but it didn't, thank goodness."
ENVIARON UN CASE DIFERENTE AL MODELO SOLICITADO.
"I have tried other Bluetoothsbut they never fit or sound right I found that all the Motorola ones that I tried satisfied . I saw this one a great price so, I bought it ."
"I replaced a failing Apple lightning cabe with this one and it works great.  The connector is the same size as the Apple connector, so it can be plugged in without having to remove the case I use."
Perfect
I LOVE IT CAN PUT IT ON MY JEANS BELT LOOP AND PUT IPHONE IN IT AND TRACK MY STEPS  WONDERFUL
Front screen came out and it was hard to use the screen when it was on.
"Worked fine, but had some non-adhesion to the edges, but overall its a great product."
"Love its ease of use, flexibility, and portability. Magnet works well, even through 2 layers of rubber/plastic phone cover. I only gave it a 4 because I am not convinced the strong magnet doesn't damage my phone. After using the mount for a couple of days, my phone started acting very strangely and didn't respond to touch like it used to. However, after leaving it off the magnet and restarting, the problems were gone. I only use it as absolutely necessary anyway, since having my phone readily visible while I drive is not smart driving."
"Works great, not much else to mention."
Phone case created odd echoing noise. Used it or one week and the purchased a replacement from a brand I'm more familiar with.
It was awesome!!! Worked for my Apple Tv
Durable for everyday use by my 7 years old. The rotating center of the cover attachment functions as an excellent finger grip to hold onto the slippery iPad. The cover padding is thick and firm to protect the touch screen from any inadvertent shock. The padded snap-on back cover provides reasonable drop protection to the corners and to the side edges.
It works.
I just got my case in the mail. The case does not add much bulk to the phone. Dust covers for headphone and power port are a plus. Screen protector for front and back are included. They are great quality. Just make sure phone surface is clean before applying screen protector.
Good product.
This is ReStore SL4000 4000mAh Power Bank with Backup Solar Panel. I try to charge my LG phone with solar battery as much as possible.  I love solar battery chargers. I keep the charger on patio on weekends and let it charge fully. This charger is simple. One input for charging itself and one for charging devices. Simple and size of a smartphone. Works great in emergencies. If you are dedicated you could charge phones daily through this as well. A sample was sent for review purposes.
great speakers for the money
Just as ordered. Perfect!
Absolutely loved it.  It's so clear and for an excellent price. Well done CaLifu
Works great for my iphone case that won't fit different types of inputs.
"great case, has a manly matte black finish !"
I have to give this a poor review firstly because when I received the screen it couldn't be installed properly because the ribbons wouldn't connect properly. It would take so long to get another screen I decided to move onto a new phone and now that I would like to return the screen in exchange for another (and pay a difference if need be) the seller won't even reply
"My son loves these, I was impressed with the quality and features. I have had no problems, but the customer support team still reaches out to make sure everyone is enjoying the product."
"Perfect gift for my son. He's already dropped the phone twice, and this case really protected it!"
the best
Great
Just got mines today and it's great. Better than what I expected. Will be buying more of these soon. Thank you so much.
Very poor quality. Does not stick to dashboard.
Works like it says. The only thing is that it decreases the volume of the speakers.
Love this. Prettier than the pictures
Thanks!
"This is a very nice case for my iPhone 6. The phone fits nice and snug and I do not have to worry about it falling out. The case does a great job at protecting the phone from bumps, dings, scraps and scratches. It also does a nice job of protecting the phone from medium drops. I have dropped mine a couple times and the phone came away with no damage. All the cut outs and buttons are perfectly placed so there is easy access to all the ports and the buttons are easy to find and press. I can plug up my charger cable and earphones without having to remove the case. The front of the case has a nice lip around the edge of the screen so the glass never touches any surfaces. The case adds very little thickness to the phone which is a huge plug in my book. The cover is clear so I can see the awesome look of my iPhone 6. It also does not show finger prints or other smudges like other clear cases I have had. The lanyard is a nice touch to a great case. I can now wear my phone around my neck and not worry about dropping it when my hands are full. I purchased this product for a reduced price to make an honest and unbiased review."
"After 2 weeks, it failed. It looks very well made , so maybe I just happen to get a lemon. I will see"
Plug it in and once it is successfully connected it lights up.  No guess work.
I was very schocked when I received this and in a good way . the product looked new and I purchased it for my 12 year old daughter and she loves it .
perfect size.. fast recharge of my phone
Great!
If you want to have your iphone safe just use a screen protector! My phone has dropped many times and with the glass it everything alright..
"works perfect, give me 4g full bars in areas where i normally have no signal. I have owned 4 of the 3g versions and will stick with Wilson."
"Perfect, not too long, not too short. The suction works as advertised. The bottom fold out piece is not even necessary, as the clamps hold my LG G3 just fine as is. And I see that as a plus, because otherwise I'd have to fiddle with the charger cord a little since the charging port is on the bottom. Though there is an opening in the bottom piece, so a cord can go through it."
"Great case, looks nice and protects my phone really well. The rubber used feels soft and doesn't get dirty easily like other rubber cases."
Blu makes great devices. This is a tablet but it can't be use as a cell phone. For me it's a little awkward because it's a little too big. But it's great the image is very clear it's very sturdy product.
Got it quickly and it works great
"The case is great, people can hear you speak, etc. it's a little heavy but you'd get use to it quickly. Lastly, the headphones port is hard to use with right angles beats wired earbuds. Otherwise it's totally perfect!"
Good battery
Excellent I must say! I bought it for my 13 year old son and he loves it too.
Love it I can work around the yard without carrying my iPod around<br />Sound is clear and you can even change songs with the push of a button on the headphones
This is a great screen protector! I've gotten it for my parents and sisters phone. I still have the proginal one on that I bought almost a year ago. Only replacing it because they had to replace my phone.
"Worked as well as expected, still cardboard. Don't expect it to last forever."
"Small-ish capacity, but charges my phone at least 2-3 times fully. Love the built in cable and charger. This goes in my bag everywhere with me"
this is a good product you should buy this product is awesome. it arrive early . i give 5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Love cases like this so much
"Very practical and easy to install. Great value and does the job. Will allow one a wider range of exposure too, not to mention greater clarity when shooting those panorama views. Yes, I would highly recommend this product."
Suuuch a great case!!! I loved it. Will definately buy more in different colors. Great buy
perfect
"The pentalobe star screwdriver is too big and can't be used to extract the screws near the lightning charger. I tried calling &#34;customer service&#34; twice at 206.607.1333, no answer, &#34;The voicemail box is full, please try your call again later.&#34;"
"For the price, it is well worth it. I've only used this for a few weeks, but I haven't had any problems. The size of the &#34;encasement&#34; over the base of the plug is small enough to fit my iPhone, which is protected by a bumper. This is a huge plus, since cables of other brands, e.g., Belkin, are not as conservative when it comes to the size of the adapter end. I also appreciate that the cable is more rigid than conventional cables, i.e., it doesn't get twisted and caught up in stuff when I'm moving my iPhone around on my desk or in my car. This is a minor point, but with typical cables it is as irritating as wrapping up a garden hose. Unless something negative happens in the future, I would definitely buy this product again."
Excellent product. Holds my Galaxy Note 4 without a problem.
"I like this case, this is the second one I've purchased (the first was for the iPhone 6 and this one is the six plus).  Although the product details do not make this claim, I have dropped the phone repeatedly without damage.  The color is exact (I'm viewing it from an old iPad).  The case allows my phone to still be slim and fit into my wallet.  I will purchase again."
"Perfect fit.  Quality seems good.  Carabiner is probably more useful, for me, than the belt loop.  I prefer the belt clips.  But overall a good product for the money."
"Very cute design, fits the phone well."
Colors not nearly as vibrant as the pictures display.
It is a nice color of black and my husband likes how it feels in his hand.
One of the best cases.  I can put all my cards in it and it doesn't scratch my phone.  It is soft and not too big. I would definitely order it again.  Was sent to me so fast!
Perfect
I didn't buy a screen protector because it said it came with one. But it didn't. Bummer
"Very nice and sturdy feeling, the film that comes with it is removable and I replaced it with a glass screen protector."
Great seller. Fast delivery. Product as described. Thank you!
"This product is garbage. The first one I bought, lasted 2 months.  I thought maybe it was a random fluke.  So I bought another one. It lasted 7 days. 7 days! Both cords worked fine the day before. Then suddenly they wouldn't charge my iPhone or iPad. Don't waste your money."
Didn't even have this screen protector on for more than a day and dropped my phone and both the protector and my screen shattered. Would not recommend this product at all!!
Great idea at a great price!
This is a beautiful case it's exactly what I wanted. I recommend this to anyone. It fits perfectly and it's a wonderful color.
"amazing results, and i love their customer service."
A++++
"This is a little bulkier than I would like but I like that it has a replaceable battery. I put this on my Son's iPod case since he keeps misplacing it and it has helped us not leave it in restaurants and find out if it is still in the car or his room. I have used the sound emitter from the app several times. The distance tracking is not that accurate, but the play sound ability makes up for that."
loved it!
"Sliding in and out of belt clip is difficult and gets stuck frequently, as if it is slightly too tight.  Clip pin started coming out within a month where I would have to manually put it back in, and belt clip broke and fell apart from one fall."
Nice neat cover. Not intended to be a wallet
Works great
Good price for a good case
"Would have given it a five, but the orange was just a slight shade off.. still like the product.."
Work great!!
"Great stand, I would recommend it to anyone who wants the ability to charge their watch and phone at the same time.  I use mine with a 42mm watch and a iPhone 6 plus so size is no issue.  My only wish is better cable management, the watch cable stays put well but the one for the phone has to be tied around the base.  It works but some kind of clip holding the phone cord in place would be nice so it doesn't fall to the floor when not in use."
Incredible case.
"Very happy with the case overall, but there is one small problem. Aux cords will not fit in the headphone jack. In order to make them fit I had to trim some of the plastic off my Aux cord with a knife so it was thin enough to fit."
I have extra if my screen protector brakes
"I just got it- was very easy to put on, no bubbles:-) Keeping my fingers crossed and hope to avoid a &#34;drop test&#34;! I also like their lifetime warranty promise."
Good.
Not adequate.
Functions extremely  well..  The best case I have ever used.. Have not dropped it as yet but it is very well made and I am sure that it will protect my phone.
"This is the one of the best cases I have ever purchased! I had one for my ZTE Savvy phone by Straight Talk, and the only reason I sold it is that the phone just quit working! I would have kept this case, except that it would not fit my present phone, contrary to another Amazon review.  Too bad! If you are thinking about getting this case, go ahead, and I don't think you will regret it!!"
satisfied
Perfect replacement for my lost ear hooks
"Awesome product very thin and very easy to put on and doesn't get in the way of my case, I will be recommending this to my friends"
Just what I needed
Very thin and flimsy case. Offers no protection. I ordered the mint green and received a dark blue case.
Great buy
Have only had it for 2 months and the strap has broken off and the colors have dulled considerably. Did not last long at all!!!
"Is a great product, I put it to my phone as soon as arrive. Thank you guy's that was really fast."
Seems sturdy enough. Comes with screen protector that is ok. Not too bulky. Can make it difficult to fit most ear phone Jacks.
i love it
A o K<br />LOOKS GOOD FEELS GOOD BUT NUT SURE IF PROTECTS THE PHONE
Heavy duty
exelent
It's just what I wanted...
Excellent portable charger don't have 2 go inside and charge it
"The quad lock rocks!  I love the speed of connecting my phone (under 2 seconds) and removing it (also under 2 seconds).  I have one on both my road bike and my mountain bike.  The poncho works when it rains, although I have not been in a heavy storm with it.  The only issue I have found is the mount attachment bands break too easily.  The zip ties are more permanent, but feel less tight than the rubber bands.  After my bands broke, I decided to go with my own rubber bands and keep a few handy in my bike bag."
Great for geocaching via bike. Love this style. It'S secured and easy to see the screen still.
Sturdy
Works great!  No road noise from inside the semi truck.
"So much better than the old versions of playing iPhone over the radio. Clear sound as if it was hooked up to the iPhone. Occasionally, it drops the connection especially when I use Siri. I just re-pair the device and all is good."
I use this all the time and would purchase again in a hreat beat.
ok
Good value to prevent opening otter box to get at jack
"this product does not work, it is awful!!!  ... water damage to iPhone 5S ...  life proof does not stand behind its product ..."
Works very well for Droid Maxx phone.  I like the &#34;kickstand&#34; part of case.  Get a alot of comments on that feature.
More than enough for the big three
"Excellent product, fits great... I paired this up with my favorite case the NewTrent Trentium (removed stock plastic screen protector and used this tempered glass) it looks flawless! Thank you JETech for making such a high end, quality tempered glass screen protector for such a reasonable price... Very satisfied customer for life here! :) Thank you"
"I love these! I bought two of these and loved them so much that I bought a third. They are super long, which is really handy. I have one plugged in behind a couch, and because the cord is so long, I can sit anywhere on the sectional and still have my phone plugged in and by my side. I also have one of these by my bed, so I can plug in my phone and hold it comfortably while it charges (instead of having to awkwardly lean over the side of the bed to avoid straining a shorter cord). My wife and I have had these for probably six months now and used them daily--they are still in excellent condition. I highly recommend these.<br /><br />Also, they charge our phones very quickly."
Works nice
Not satisfied at all. Broke easily.
My daughter has only has this for a few weeks and the part of the case that holds the phone in place is completely breaking apart. I told her I would look into getting a replacement but it seems I'm a few days past the return policy. Wish I would have emailed them when the problem started which was almost immediately.
"So far so good, great product for the price though it does feel cheap but that doesn't matter because it delivers great sound!"
Charges phone but not constantly. Often have To check make sure its charging device.  Its not all that
Nice Simple cute phonecase
Awesome case! protects the corners of the phone very well and the kickstand makes handsfree viewing easy.  Wish I hadn't of lost the holster!!
"Case fits snug, but is still flexible and easy to hold."
Rubber can get loose after a while and you'll just find yourself closing it again. May have to remove the iPod every now and then to clean the ipod and plastic of dust build up in corners that are difficult to get. Otherwise its good and provides good protection if paired with a screen protector.
I love this case. Does not add weight to the phone. It is not bulky. Does provide some protection if dropped. Understand not Ottabox level of protection but I personally do not need it.
Good. Just be carefully when pulling them out
I purchased this mostly for camping but it's the best purchase I have made. I use it constantly. My new car doesn't charge if the engine is off. My cell a lot does something that uses energy and maybe fading fast. This weighs no more than a cell and charges on the fly. I used constantly  to keep my kindle charged while away from a power source. Yesterday I carried on a long hike because the phone had dropped to 52% for some reason. Love this thing!
"I got mine in the mail, and I've been using it daily. It's fits perfectly on the A/C vent closest to the steering wheel of my tahoe. Great affordable product for quality you can count on. You won't be disappointed."
Love this adapter. Charges my phone really fast
"Cheap and functional, exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use, and keeps my phone safe."
Excellent product!!
This works great for a low phone battery.  I highly recommend this product.
Love love love this case
Good product.  Goes on easy
Have had one of these for 8 months and I dont even notice that its on my phone. Recently dropped my phone on its face and the screen protector cracked but the phone screen underneath is perfect. I believe it did what it was supposed to do. Will be ordering another one.
I've had this screen protector on for less than a week and it has already began cracking on the bottom left edge. It is line up perfectly and not hanging over the rounded corner and I have not dropped it.Other than that it would be nice......unfortunately I am sure it will continue to crack and split since it has started already.
ok.
"Amazing case, very very practical, it has good capacity, the magnet is working properly, and to an extent I'd say it is a water proof."
"The best there is. alarm wise. It really does have great range, but up to a mile? i have yet to test that. But i can easily lock or unlock my car from a block or two away. The only cons i can think of, are 1.) the speaker is not as loud as i'd like it to be. and 2.) the remote start works great, but i noticed that it runs the starter faster than is needed to start my vehicle, after a while of usage i wouldn't be surprised if it burnt my starter out. Now i'm not 100% sure if the system is at fault for that, or the installer, but i definitely don't like that. other than these 2 issues. i highly recommend to buy this alarm, and buy a shock,tilt, and glass sensor to further secure your car."
Great product!
very good quality
Order the wrong ones.  But will use on other stuff
Thanks. So. Much.  God bless.
The case is great. I would buy it again.
Thank you
Its 100% protective but adding this makes phone heavy..
good value
"It worked for a little while (a few months), but then I'd have to hold the cord in place for it to start charging. Sometimes when it would start charging, the phone would pop up a message that said it wasn't supported by Apple and wouldn't work at all."
Very nice
"I am notorious for losing my charger and having a dead or dying phone.  It can be especially frustrating when I need to make an important phone call or have to leave the house and I have an uncharged phone in the case of an emergency.  Having this backup battery charger can be so convenient!  It is so easy to use.  I plugged it up via usb to my laptop right out of the package to make sure that it was fully charged and then I just tossed it right into my purse.  I always know where it is and when I need to charge my phone with it I can just plug it up the the included cord and drop it right back into my purse.  It does a great job of quickly charging up my phone.  I like the red color!  The charger features a stip of 4 blue lights that light up both when the unit is being charged and when the unit is charging my device.  There is a really neat feature about this power bank that is unlike others I have used, it has a little, but bright, flashlight on it!  Just click the power button twice and it turns on.  I thought that was pretty neat and unique.  Overall, I am happy with the product and its performance.  I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"We took our cases on a river rafting trip and they worked perfectly. Took pictures with my iphone 6 in it and it worked well. We did the recommended test in it first. I purchased a 3rd one to give to a friend. As an update, we've used this several times.  It also is great to carry your phone in when biking or hiking and then you don't have to find a pocket and enables you to use your phone for photos quickly.  I recently used it while biking in Colorado, and it gave me quick access to take pictures for at brief stops. I've also used it while out sightseeing by storing my ID and credit cards in it as well.  It's very handy!"
"Works fine but takes time for me to wiggle it around in order for it to connect correctly. If it shifts from a certain position, it doesn't connect.  Not sure if it's my car or the Scosche itself."
Nice colors and seems to be working perfectly
great product!
All very good
"Not enough protection, would not recommend"
The screen protector on this item is horrible. If they fix that portion of the case it's awesome
Love it!
Receive in time states. Great to have and helps to organize
"It worked the few times I used it to power one device over the past several months, but when two USB cables were plugged in (only one connected to a phone), it smoked (that unique, burning smell of something electronic).  The description says it has fuse protection, but there is no simple way to open it to check the fuse."
"Weak design. belt clip tore off after several weeks, first on I had tore off after two months."
"Very well made and comfortable product . Love the longer arm strap, secret key holder and secret cash holder!!!"
I replaced my non-working $20 back-up camera with this Pyle one. Installation was easy because the wires were already in place. Decent picture quality. Nice in daylight or pitch black night time. The only thing I noticed is it &quot;reacts slowly&quot;. My old one I had my Edge CTS monitor set for 2 seconds delay. This camera I had to set it for .5 seconds and it actually takes about 2-3 seconds to turn on. No worries. Seems to be much better quality than the last one I had. Hope it lasts!!
"Does not work at all. Went to a water park and put all my things in there, from cell phone to money. Everything got wet. Thank goodness my phone didn't get damaged because that would have been a big problem."
hate it hate it hate it.  You get what you pay for.  Terrible connections.
"It's cheap, and it works to play my songs from my ipod in my car, but not for long."
Looks great with my gold iPhone
"Its ok, though it would be a little more rugged"
A little bulky so it's hard to fit in my pocket but it looks great and I don't have to worry about my phone getting beat up.
Right size<br />Not too bulky
Great product & servicr
nice
Excited!
excellent and exactly what i expected.
My granddaughter loves it...
"I'm one of millions of people that constantly wonder why Apple, the inventor of all kinds of cool products, can't seem to make a power cord capable of lasting more than a few months.  Shame on you, Apple, because you could do better but you can't or won't.<br /><br />Now enter the Anker cord.  I originally bought another cord on Amazon which was a few dollars less.  Needless to say that cord barely worked at first and quickly died completely.  I then found Anker and have been very happy for the 3 weeks I've had it.<br /><br />Materials, design and quality all seem good.  Good value and product...  They could teach Apple a few things, I think!"
Good
Excellent
It's working out very well.
When I press my button the outgoing beep is very loud so loud I have to take it off
"I purchased these headphones March 20th 2015 off of Groupon & boy am I still dreading do so. I always have my Apple EarPods so I purchased these for gym use. Now I just don't use them at all! They slow up the process on my iPhone. Every click while typing, every music note, every noise period is caused with delay with the phone and headphones are paired. The sound quality is horrible. When trying to watch a movie or video while the headphones are paired, the headphones are trying to catch up to the video...it's like watching a Chinese movie w/o subtitles. It's a headache. One good thing I can say about this product is that the battery lasts for quite some time. Otherwise than that DO NOT PURCHASE!"
This is great.  I use it solely for my TV so that I can transmit from it to my headphones while I am on the treadmill.  I had been looking for something to give my TV a Bluetooth connection and both Best Buy and HH Gregg said it didn't exist so I was nervous about this at first but it definitely works.  The one complaint I have is the volume.  I'm not sure if it's attributable to the transmitter or the headphones I am using but I have to turn the TV volume almost all the way up to make it loud enough while I work out (not a huge deal unless I forget how loud it is and unplug the transmitter).
Lasted 2 months. Won't record nor will the on screen menu show up on the screen.
Fit perfectly
"This device flat out works, this is by far the easiest way to track your miles and keep a log for the IRS that I have come across, plug it in and forget about it. OR go one step further like I did and go to best buy and have them hard wire it and install it under my dash board. Customer service has been outstanding both times I have had a need for it. I can not say enough good things about the way I was treated by the customer service rep and how happy I am with the device.<br /><br />Dave Mac"
Beware that the manufacturer failed to account for the S6's 2.5D glass curvature at the edges. This screen protector extends at least 2mm into this curved area and you will see a cloudy 2mm line all the way around the perimeter. This is the glue basically spanning the gap between the ultra flat protector and phone's screen slope. A truly outstanding product would be one that followed the curve or accurately stopped where the curve begins. I am convinced flat glass protectors are not the way to go for the S6. Use a film type.
Good product fast shipping
Quick Honest Summary Review.<br /><br />1. Perfect fit. And will not raise a glass screen protector (if there is one on your phone)<br />2. Will Not turn your phone into a brick<br />3. Extremely durable (the kids drop my phone a lot)<br />4. Beautiful case<br />5. High quality materials and feels nice in hand<br />6. Buttons are easy to press<br />7. Connecting the charger or earphones is simple and even a generic charger or any earphone plug will fit.<br /><br />All in all its a great durable and stylish case that will protect your phone really good.<br />Seller was great & shipping was extremely fast<br />Thank you Seller and Amazon for another great purchase and product
Very good
Excellent  value. Very durable and attractive.
Works great !
My husband loves this watch. He uses it for his bike rides and walking. It is very easy to use. Definetly recommend!
Love this case! I love the shape it gives my phone. With the Droid Turbo being so big it makes it easy to hold.
Allowed us to spread them around the house...
worked great
great one i like it
Charged my phone only a few times then stopped working.  I would not recommend it.
works fine i have dropped it from about 30 feet and without the cover my glass would have cracked but with the cover on it it made a mark on the cover but not the glass.
"the volume button does not work properly. I'm unable to turn the volume up or done as the case and volume button don't seem to line up. Furthermore, I have to remove the prone from the case to charge it as the hole on the case is not the correct size. I have since stopped using the case."
Fits very well.  Love that the color of my phone comes through.
I love the color of this case. I love that it's protective but not bulky. I love the feel of the case.
"Perfect fit, perfect suction"
"Easy to install, looks great!"
cheap is always good
These just came in the mail and due to my other one not doing a very good job at charging my phone I plugged one in immediately. And wow not only does it work it appears to be very sturdy and is charging my phone super fast! It's a little shorter than the other one but oh well I'll take it!
Excellent way to mount a phone.
"Well made and compact, this works great for the DrivePro. Knocking off a star for the relatively hefty price, should have been included with the unit."
Nice  case gold is almost same color gold as the phone fits the phone perfect
Worked well and was easy to install with all the needed pieces.
"Cannot see a thing if I'm outside during daylight, for regular use I have to put brightness all the way up and it drains my battery, I will look for another brand."
This case is SUPER CUTE! It's HUGE And will not fit in your pocket and come with a horible smell besides that it's perfect !
Protects my daughters phone well enough.  I just wish it were easier to take off for when we need to get to the battery.
"This product flat out doesn't work.  The suction cup doesn't suck onto tiles in pools, and you can't hear anything under water."
Bought for the whole family
excelente
"First rate product. Really useful and helps to keep clutter off the dashboard. Could not recommend the product or company to highly. Great service, great product."
Great TPU case fits perfectly.  The back is a little bit more slick than the all clear TPU cases but it won't show the scratches like the all clear TPU cases do.  Very similar to Belkin's Grip Candy but on this one the sides have little bumps making it easier to hold.
"Love the soft &quot;ballerina pink&quot; leather band. Not of the best quality leather, but for the price, it's well worth it.  When the thing breaks, I'll be sure to get another. I had no problem what so ever switching out the bands.  38mm Sport  Small band"
"I'm a fan of Anker's products because they are made with superb quality & lasting performance and this PoweLine Micro USB {1ft} charging cable is no exception. I've used this cable to charge a Samsung tablet, HTC One M8 cellphone and an iPhone. I noticed that it charges my devices a lot faster than traditional USB cables that I've had in the past. It's very strong due to the tough kevlar material on the inside of the cable. The PowerLine Micro USB Cable will charge any device with a USB to micro USB connection. The compatibility is endless. Bending the Anker PowerLine Micro cable countless times will not hurt it one bit. These charging cables are tough and built to last. They come in different lengths. Be sure to get a length that is suitable for your needs. The only USB charging cable you will ever need and it's backed by a company you can trust. I was supplied this sample for test and evaluation purposes. I promise this review is fair and honest."
It works well.. kudos
Perfect 4 my phone
Sleet and handsome design make this case a winner for all. Love the way if fit had no issues at all.
I put one of these on my new Fenix 3 watch three months ago and it still looks perfect.  Not a scratch on it and it fits PERFECTLY on the screen.
Excellent !!!!!
The battery bank charges really fast and it charges my cell phone really fast too
Fits my IPhone 6 + perfectly & for the price the quality is unbeatable.. Love this case
"These r great. I use in gym, and they have never fallen out.  I would recommend them to anyone and would definitely purchase them again."
As advertised. Replacement cradle for Samsung Galaxy gear.
I thought the tips would be thinner but I can Arial use them.
This works perfectly.  Holds your phone securely.
"Both my ex husband and I own this phone and my mother, who had the latest iphone (as of 2015), HATED her IPHONE, but LOVED my Samsung Galaxy note 3. She's 91 and she found her apple product too non-intuitive. In 1 hour of instruction of her new SAMSUNG NOTE 3, she is operating her TV, has her UBER app set up, has her TV channel guide, learned how to do screen mirroring. Next lesson I'll show her how she can touch her phone to mine to share photos. I've had a lot of phones but this is hands down THE BEST phone I've ever owned. I watch Netflix if in the gym if Im just on the treadmill.  Verizon told me to find it on Amazon because they were or of them.  They've gone on to other newer models bit there's a good reason why this particular model is so popular.  I used this phone in europe as well. I went on $4.00 international plan with Verizon for a month, then when in Europe, I switched out the Sim card. Worked great. Switched Sims when done. Be sure to alway buy &#34;unlocked&#34; and the phone needs to work on your carrier's sustem. In my case, I bought a 900V (V is for Verizon)."
"This thing kicks butt. Major upgrade for my phone. I didn't use the included screen protector. I bought a 3-pack of JETech plastic screen protectors and they work flawlessly with this case.  Even though it doesn't have a kickstand (my only complaint with the design), this case fixes several issues with my S6. First, it provides a non-slippery surface for what is an ultra slick glass-backed phone that slides off of pretty much anything I leave it on. So now my phone doesn't careen off the center console of my truck like an air hockey puck while I gently glide up the driveway. The buttons and both parts of the case feel very solid, and neither flimsy nor manufactured with excessive tolerances. The case clipped together perfectly flush over my phone, and it looks really great and makes the phone just a tad beefier, which is nice because it makes it easier to keep a grip on the thing. I'm confident if I dropped it getting out of the car or while walking down the street, my phone would be safe even if the case were scratched/dinged or popped apart on impact.  Second, it provides amazing versatility as an extended battery. This was my biggest gripe with the S6 - subpar battery life with no way to buy an additional battery to swap in as necessary, or (my typical choice) a bigger extended battery to keep the phone going strong for up to a couple of days of regular, non-heavy usage. This rechargeable case elegantly solves the problem and does so flawlessly. The button is flush with the case and cannot be easily depressed on accident. You press and hold it for a couple seconds, and the case displays how much juice is left in it and immediately charges the phone. I was satisfied with the speed with which this is accomplished - I went from 65% to 100% in 40 minutes. This is precisely in line with the advertised 0%-100% full charge time of 2 hours.  Finally, the forward-facing stereo speakers are extremely loud and sound great, very clear. Definitely an upgrade from the bottom-mounted mono speaker the phone was designed with. Listening to tunes or playing games on the S6 without a Bluetooth speaker or headphones has never sounded so punchy and detailed. You can actually hear the stereo separation, and each track in the mix comes through pretty cleanly. I was impressed with the clarity and volume of the speakers.  One more downside to this case is that standard 1/8&#34; stereo plugs can't reach the headphone jack on the S6 when inside the case because the case is so thick, it prevents the plug from reaching the jack. Luckily, Alpatronix ships a small 1/8&#34; stereo extender with this rechargeable case, and I just leave it attached to the end of the aux cable in my truck. I guess if I used headphones a lot, it might be annoying to have to bring this little adapter with me everywhere I went in case I wanted to listen to some tunes, but since I only listen to music off my phone when driving, it is a negligible issue and was solved by the manufacturer rather reasonably.  Overall, I'm stoked. This was precisely what I needed."
Very good one first time i buy a selfie stick<br />And i am happy with this purchase!
"It reminds me of the material used around the Gorilla cases built to protect your phone, which makes me think it can take some abuse. "
"My phone charges super fast when connected to this in my truck. Not sure if it's a product of this device, or the power coming from the truck, or both, but I highly recommend it."
I bought this for my husband and he loves it.
I like this case it's what it comfortable and fit exactly perfect on my iPhone 6 Plus I'm very happy with this case
Love it! It bends to fit if you are trying to get it into a tight space to charge your band. It works well- no complaints yet!
"Very good, the only thing I dislike is that it makes the images look blurry."
The case fits perfect love the red to match all my other red stuff. It feels sturdy and does a good job of still letting you take advantage of the edge
Very tough. Very good screen protector. Quick shipping and reasonable price. Thank you !
"Very good product, I recommend it 100% guaranteed"
I love this!  Keeps all the cords and devices well organized!
"About 7 months after I purchased this unit, one day it suddenly stopped working. I contacted BESTEK because it had one year warranty. They told me to send it back. I sent it back (I had to pay return shipping.) No answer for a month. I sent an email again. No answer for another two months."
working perfect
"Easy to install, great clear screen.  good fit."
Everything was good.
Perfect! Keeps my phone safe and i bedazzled it to give it a bit more pizazz
nice~
Awesome! Very happy with it.
So it seems the issue with the lower reviews is some people are receiving products that aren't genuine.<br /><br />I received the right product. It works great. My only complaint is that the screen has a sort of blue tint over it seen on other reviews. I thought this was going to show up on the video file BUT IT DOESNT. the actual video clips are crystal clear.
this cost so much and really doesn't work like it is soppose to. I am shipping mine back.
"I read all these great reviews and was excited to receive my product.  I'm not sure if I just got a lemon, but the volume buttons (left side of the phone when holding it as if to talk) on this case do not align properly with the buttons on my Samsung Galaxy S6.  As such, I can  only turn the volume up when the case is on, unless I use the touch screen.  I will be returning the case immediately because it does not fit properly."
This mount is awesome. Holds iPhone 6Plus. Really nice for using GPS apps. I highly recommend it.
"This case it's fantastic and heavy duty. Very protective, I have dropped my phone many times with this on and my phone is perfectly fine."
The phone doesn't work properly in the case. It is too big and bulky so when you actually try to use your screen or even turn up the volume it wont allow you to.
"I am always dropping my phone. The other day I dropped it from a 3 story stair case. When I got to my phone, it was laying face down. I picked it up and it was just fine. A few scratches but other than that it was fine!!"
"Works as expected several months in. And such a pretty color, too! :-)"
"The card slots are not durable. The seams keeping the cards in are already coming apart. Casing broke in 3 locations - bottom by the speaker, volume and lock button. Great price point, you get what you pay for."
Bad product broke faded donot buy.waste of  money I had to gave it n star donot  deserve  that
"I've received a lot of compliments on the beautiful design. I really enjoy the case and it is a comfort that it gives my phone an extra layer of protection. I also like not having to carry a purse, or juggle a phone and wallet, for quick trips. I especially love the convenience when I am on my bike. The magnetic strap keeps the wallet closed. There is a window space for an ID, and a second slot to keep a debit/credit card or two. There is also a pocket for bills, but no way to store coins. The quality of the case is very nice. Beautiful stitching, well constructed holder that your phone snaps into, keeping it secure, and easy to clean material.  I set it down on a splotch of tomato sauce and it wiped right off without staining. This is the first phone wallet I've purchased for myself. I am really enjoying it. I plan to purchase other patterns from this company. They have great style.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount to test and provide my honest review."
Love it.

"I have been looking for a car mount for a while now and finally found one that works great! A friend recommended eLander mount and I have been very satisfied with it so far. I like the 360 degree adjustable back and that the joystick is flexible and allow me to adjust what angle I want my screen at. The best part is there is no assembly required, you just pop it on the vents and go. The only issue I do have is that it will fall if I do not secure the back in the vent enough, otherwise I have zero complaints. I highly recommend this product!"
great product!
"they died within a few months, will not buy again"
"Purchased on Aug. 10 and As of today, Aug. 31 it has multiple scratches and is actually cracked across one corner. I have not and do not abuse my phone(s). This protector has been on since I put the phone in the Otterbox Defender case and yet it is damaged. It was easy to put on, gave good coverage on the phone's glass and it felt really good when using it."
Great product at discount price. Seller delivered as listed.
4 months later all of the cords are in the trash. Also way too short
"I ordered one and it's really pretty I love the decoration but within one day of having it, the corner was cracked and I didn't even drop my phone. So I ordered the free replacement and I had it for about a week an it's already chipped out of the bottom corner and again, I haven't dropped my phone."
"Love it, it's exactly what I expected"
Great product charges rapidly
perfect
The case was delivered on the date it was assigned and it came really early during the day which I liked. The case fits my iPhone 5s perfectly and I love this case.
decent.
Fits good. Not perfect but good.
"I'm not normally a review person...but I will say this is a wonderful case / wallet.  The phone case is very slim and looks professional, while the magnet that secures it into the 'wallet' portion of the case is very sturdy and keeps the phone in place well.  The best part, in my opinion, is the quality of the leather.  Thanks!"
Very fast charging time.  No problems at all.
won't fit
"Does the trick and is MUCH sturdier than the other kind that I ordered (also a car vent iPhone holder), which had rubber prongs that fell off within a few months."
I know these will be a hit for my Grandkids for part of Christmas...
"Great product, GREAT experience!"
My wife loves loves loves this case. It fits perfect and has held up great over the last 8 months. People stop her all the time telling her they love the color.
good product
Doesn't fit it has dents in battery and looks used
Mine stopped working after 6 month
Easy to put on and protects the phone well. My son totally loves it. So great for the pre-paid phoen we got - the cases were not available in the store and this is exactly what he wanted. Perfect!
She loves it. She did say that it required her to remove the back of the phone - then it snapped in.  I think that should be noted on its details
"I bought two of these in Oct, 2014 for use with my new iPhone 6.  The lightning cables have never worked with my phone, even as I upgraded the OS through the current iOS v8.4.1.  I get the error &#34;This cable or accessory is not certified and may not work reliably with this iPhone.&#34;  In fact, it does not charge the phone at all.  The charger itself will support other cables (such as the ones sold by Amazon in their Basics line) but the cables included with this unit do NOTHING.  Definitely not happy with this purchase, these were expensive but not worth it!"
"I was selected to review this product at a discounted rate. It took a while longer than normal to receive the product, however upon arrival I was very pleased. The case is light weight, yet cery durable. I was happy to find that it did not make my phine bulky like other cases. Overall I am very pleased."
"Wrong unit for my machine, even thou I was informed it would work.<br /><br />Just tossed it"
I am pretty sure that the 'screen replacement' is not glass and is plastic. Very miss leading and complete udder junk.
I upgraded from the Lumia 521.<br />I like everything about the Lumia 640 XL especially the big bright screen. I am using it with GoSmart Mobile with no problems.
can i send it back and get another the phone turn black don't work no more
Thank you I got my order in perfect condition and the packadge was wonderful thank you very much I really like your service

Loved this otterbox! Dropped it so many times and phone was in perfect condition. Only bad thing is that it got dirty so quick and it's hard to clean.
This product does not work. I bought two and both of them broke within a few uses. It does not mount on to the vent well. The phone falls from it all the time.
This case fits great and protects the phone pretty well. We accidently ordered the wrong size of iPhone case and we were able to return with no hassle. We are very happy with the product and very happy with the service.
Works perfectly after you get it organized. Amazing ability to get super fun shot. Would recommend it to anyone.  Kind of a plug and play.
"Works great, exactly what I wanted."
real good phone
Great. I wish there were other colors.
I had high hopes for these cords but my first one only lasted about 3 weeks. Maybe I'll have better luck with the next two but so far not a good purchase. So disappointed! :(
"Love it! It covers my phone and protects it very well. Plus, it's very cute."
"Pink and bling, I love it!  Fits my phone perfectly, I've dropped it and it's been protected.  Came with a screen protector and pink stylus as well.  I'm happy with my sparkly cover, highly recommend!"
Top of the line. Great investment to protect my phone and looks great at the same time !
I like the case. It fit perfectly and it's very sturdy. It took too long to get here.
ok
"I've used this on a golf cart now for four different outings. It is the best holder I've found for my iPhone and I use the iPhone app while golfing so I need to be able to see it and know it is secure. The grip on the plastic windshield is exceptional. It easily detaches to apply to another golf cart if necessary. It grips the phone is such a way that you know it won't come loose. I use it both on the road, on the cart paths and on the fairways and rough. It is simple and inexpensive. You can't go wrong."
It is very easy to use.  The locking of the extensions is great
I love this case.
This product does it's job well. It charges my extra battery quickly with no issues.
"Works great and fast, has a flash light also"
"To bad Garmin didn't give this the quality of their other products. Have owned for 2 years now, rarely use it anymore. I have owned other training collars and have worked for over 6 years with dog/dog training. I bought this for a Vizsla/lab mix puppy(9months). After opening seemed to be of decent materials that Garmin is know for. Operation could be easier. All the setting modes function differently and I need to carry manual or study in some detail to remember what each mode is and does. Other models I have owned are far easier to use and functions/mode is labeled on the transmitter making it much easier. The bark mode doesn't work as well as other bark collars I have. No real adjustment and doesn't sense dog bark a lot of the time making it useless for this purpose. As mentioned by others, battery life is terrible and slow to charge both transmitter and receiver. Need to plan my use the night before and recharge both units. Forget about charging on the go or replacing batteries in the field as that is not possible with this unit. First time in the field I took my dog to the mountains. Dog jumped into the water as most dogs do. Never a problem with my past unit. This one never worked again. It never went underwater deeper than Garmin said it could handle. The hand transmitter is more waterproof than the receiver the dog wears. They sure need improvement with its &#34;water resistance&#34; as they call it. Garmin was good about sending me a new one as it was under warranty, but I can't let my dog go close to any water. Living in the 2nd driest state, there is still stream, rivers, ponds, and lakes near about everywhere I take my dog making this product un-useable. I would look for another Brand as Garmin was a big disappointment. Glad I bought a aftermarket extended warranty, as this was newly on the market, I'm sure going to need it."
I love this case! Feels very sturdy and after a few drops (thank you clumsiness) the case holds up!<br />No scratches to the phone or case!<br />Good buy!
"Great product, high quality and a fantastic length; not frustratingly short and not comically long. Well worth the small fortune it cost to have this sent to NZ."
"I spent a ton of time looking for an actual waterproof case that would fit my phone. I was worried about the functionality of the bag. But the reviews on fitted cases were sketchy, and I didn't want to take the chance and trash my phone, so I went with the bag. I had strangers on the tours asking me to send them my pictures and even to take their picture."
"I bought these due to my wife's stroke last year. If I am out in the Apiary or in the Shop and she needs me , these work Awesome! But as to the range of them being 23 Miles is NOT true. the actual distance with these in an urban setting with houses , trees and such is about half a mile if that . now if I were on the top of a mountain , that was barren of obstructions like trees and such. And I was trying to talk with someone at the bottom 22 miles in a straight line , again with no obstructions like trees or natural terrain m MAYBE"
Did not work at all
"Verizon tower is about 15 miles away from our new acreage home, with complete radiant barriers in roof and walls.  .  One or two bars or -105db.  After installation, 4 to 5 bars.as low as -74 db, at least -88db.  I left transmitting antenna in attic or it would probably be even better, because I couldn't bring myself to drill holes in my new walls.  Glad I got the directional outdoor antenna.  Easy to install."
"Very good quality, transfer speeds are great."
"Bought these for two way communication between fleet vehicles.<br /><br />The Radio:<br />Pros: Attractive and low profile design, sturdy housing, good ventilation, loud speaker, loaded with features, transmits on every frequency it receives (not limited to amateur band out of the box), good mic picks up audio at any angle and voice does not drop out if you get too far from your mouth (good for inexperienced operators).<br /><br />Cons: Only red, pink, and blue display colors available (no green), When attached to an MFJ power meter this radio only put out around 12 watts on high, 8 on med, and about 4 on low(Still makes great contacts and covers nearly 10 miles vehicle to vehicle on a full length 1/4 wave antenna) The programming software that comes with this radio installed and seemed to operate well on my windows 7 64 bit OS laptop but once I went to send my channels to the radio it said that the port was not opened. This was probably me doing something wrong but without any information included with the software and with very little outside information I was not able to resolve the problem. I ended up programing the radios through the menu which worked well but was a little tedious.<br /><br />Also worth noting:Decent/standard bracket, Power cord plug and fuses are standard/identical to a Kenwood, The instruction manual is obviously translated but the majority of the information is explained well. There are some places where you may need to &#34;fill in the blank&#34; so to speak.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this radio to anyone who is needing affordable communication. A very good and sturdy unit especially for the price!"
"I love these things.  Most companies will paint on the designs but these are clearly nylon wrapped and very sturdy.  I'm expecting big things from these cables as my wife is an absolute destroyer of cables.  I use to buy cheap cables because she would go through one every couple months but I'm done with that.  I would spend the extra money for these cables again and given that they come in a multi pack with different colors, there will be no more accusations of who took whose cable.  The connections are very stable and work great.  I was very happy with these cables and the length is perfect, much better than the regular 3' that come with most standard phones.<br /><br />I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review."
"works great, highly recommended if you're using a bumper case with this phone. item arrived quickly and in good shape as well."
Charger works well and and arrived on time
Installed easily. Much less smudging than with the plastic protector I had.
Nice product good secure fit
perfect!  I've used this for about 2 months now and still grips like a champ!
"The dual 4.8A car charger has been a lifesaver time after time. I don’t know how many car charger adapters I went through but I am glade that the past is past. This little thing is power because it can charge my iPhone quicker than any other car charger I have ever tried.<br /><br />I love the fact that it is dual port instead of one. Having 2 adults in the car make it hard to charge two devices simultaneously. Now my husband and I don’t have to work for each other to charge our phone.  The blue LED indicator is nice to help me identified that I have power going through my charger. Some car charger don’t have that feature and if it does- the blue light is too bright. I didn’t have any issue with the indicator light whatsoever.<br /><br />You can also tell that woopower make good product like this car charger, because they take pride in ensuring that they build a great product. With customer in mind, they had added the circuit protection, protecting over-current, short-circuit, over charge and over temperature. The company also included a 12-month warranty of the car charger. This is a great company that produces great product.<br /><br />*Received this product at a discounted price for an exchange for an honest review."
"The case is a little thin, but then we switched from an Otter box so the comparison might not be fair. The colors are vibrant and the product quality is good. I'd buy it again, and recommend to a friend."
great ipod cover
"Great case.  Not so great screen protector.  I don't like the included protector because it doesn't stay stuck to the screen, so air pockets form and it has a &#34;bubbly&#34; feel when you're pressing on it.  Also, it doesn't have a slot for the microSD slot.  So if you want to add or remove the SD card, you have to take apart the case.  I'm going to use a razor blade and cut out an opening in the plastic for the SD slot.  I find the case difficult to separate/install/uninstall.  I broke my the outside half of my first case from removing it and reinstalling it several times, but I was probably pretty rough with it.<br /><br />I think its a great case, super durable when installed and looks nice.  I've dropped my phone several times on hard surfaces and its still good as new.  Good edges for phone calls and holding while typing.  My wife has same phone and she has another popular case and its ok but this one is better.<br /><br />IMO, best idea is to cut out the original protector and buy an aftermarket one, the kind that 'sticks' to the phone's screen.  Then re-assembled the case and it's perfect.  To remove the included screen, I used a razor blade and an old rag with some paint thinner.  Used the razor blade to cut off the screen and scrape off the glue from the backside of the case's edges.  Then removed any residual glue with the rag and a little bit of paint thinner.  Took about 10 minutes.  IMO was totally worth it.  No more bubbles and can use any screen protector you like.<br /><br />Case gets five stars, but overall four because of no sd card slot and included screen protector.  Still best case out there IMO even with the extra work.  I've bought two of them now and have tried three different cases and still think this ones the best."
This case is great!  The storage door closes securely.  I am able to fit my drivers license and a credit card.  I have had this for about 1 1/2 years and it has held up well.  After one too many drops the door recently got a crack.  It makes it a little difficult to close but once closed it still hold my card securely.  The hole for the camera did not interfere with taking pictures.  Most headphones and power cords fit as well.  It is a tight secure fit on the phone so this not something that can be taken off and on easily.
great product!  Keeps the charge for a long time and the sound quality is great.  Highly recommend!
"Yes, it did meet & exceed my expectations, so far I have been very impressed at the quality and appearance of the Piel Frama iPhone 6 plus case! I would recomment it to a friend!"
Great product. It's nice to be able to have one place to charge all of our devices without the need to use individual bricks for each device.
Not a bad case. Feels good in my hand. Doesn't slip out of my grip. Looks nice and thin but still provides decent protection. Fits the edge screen nice. Only issue is that when removing phone it's a little tough and the metal band around the case  will occasionally pop off but is easy to slide back on.
"Nice simple case, very protective back.  The rubber around the outside is a little tough making it a struggle to press the power button, but it's gotten more flexible over time."
"Exactly as expected. Nice, snug fit with a high quality stand on back. The only thing I wish it had is the clear rubber protection cover that came with the original iPhone 5 version so that it can be used in the rain if needed. Otherwise it is good."
No complaints -- tested all 3 and they work as expected. Will update if any quality issues crop up but so far so good.
"The website you contact for product service doesn't even have this product listed to request a fix. That's pretty much all you need to know about it. It's a shame they had to make the thing collapsible because that's the root of all the complaints here. Tiny little swivel joint made of cheap plastic crap, likely to break in daily use, and if it breaks they're going to blame it on you.<br /><br />I also had the on/off switch break off and rattle around inside, but that was just a few tiny screws away from a fix."
No complaints. I like the flat back of the case
"Fits phone good husband likes it a lot. Seems to help with the outside keys as well, easier to turn sound up or down."
So far so good. Working as intended. Charges fast. Carry this on my backpack and constantly using it at school and at work without a single issue so far.
Didn't work. Even after getting a replacement.
perfect
Works well with iPhone.  Will not charge iPad Air 2 since it is not an Apple certified product.
My phone wouldn't fit properly even though I bought it for the iPhone 5. The bottom piece to cover the charging port broke in about 2 days.<br />Do not waste your time on this product!
I've had no luck programing this unit at all. at one point I was able to transmit but now it will not transmit and in dual channel mode it emits a constant beeping noise.
I bought 3 and only 2 was working.
very loud and works awesome we've had it a month or two now no problems !
"For the price this is a fantastic cord. For the price it's great, and it's nice that it's a little longer than the standard Apple cord. It feels like it's made with decent quality pieces and parts, and all the connections fit snug, but not too tight.<br /><br />But I'm knocking it down a single star because it has the same issues the Apple cords have, and the end of the wires near the lightning adapter begin to fray after a few months."
Good instructions & installation tools. Still hard to install correctly.
I love this product. A lot of my friends have these  and day they love them. I just got my request for this product.
Excelente
"The seller claims this is a leather case, but it is just a cheap &#34;imitation leather&#34; plastic which is all cracked and falling apart after less than two months of use.<br />It looks nice but... CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. Do they really think they can full anyone? the picture does, but once you get it, you can quickly realize what a lousy product this is."
Not much protection there are so many more cases with more protection and cost much less. I prefer built in screen protectors and this one doesn't have one.
Neither  cord worked
"good,nice,but a littel expnesive"
"Took this to the beach last week hoping to get some nice shots of our daughters first time in the ocean. I have the 6 and my wife has the 6 Plus. Usually I will NOT take phones to the beach because sand can do a number on your phone. Thanks to Levin I had both my 6 and 6 Plus protected from the sand and even the water. I took my phone into the water and my wife wanted some underwater shots of her and my daughters feet in the sand. I dunked the Levin down underwater and was able to snap some great photos using the volume rocker button which this case gives you access to.<br /><br />All the pictures came out clear which was wonderful. One thing I did notice however was when you pulled the phone out of the water there was some slight condensation around the camera lens area, this may have been due to the fact that the water was in the high 70s but the outside heat index was 105*. This quickly disappeared and caused no issues for the phones. I appreciate the built in area for a wrist strap as well. It makes me feel a little more secure when using this around water incase it slipped from my hands.<br /><br />The screen itself is also covered with some plastic layer, It was a little difficult to type on at first but we were able to get the hang of it quickly.<br /><br />Charging the device was a bit of an issue, we had some after market cables with us who's connector heads were thicker then OEM cables. They couldn't fit inside the cut out so the phone had to be removed from the case. Upon returning home I tested charging with OEM cable and they fit perfectly.<br /><br />Overall I had a very positive experience with this. I can't knock the whole charging issue because Levin isn't going to make it to spec for every cable company.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes"
It wasn't what I was expecting I thought it was going to be a little thicker and one of those kind that you have to screw in
good
I bought this for my phone and I really liked it. This screen protector is very durable. I like that it comes in a pack of six so if you need more for your phone you can have extras !
"I LOVE Van Gogh's Starry Night, and I love having such a beautiful piece of art within grabbing reach whenever I want to look at it. Thank you for putting this painting on a cell case."
"My car has a little side window next to the windshield where I like to mount my GPS. However, the mount from Garmin does not even have an extension arm. If I mount it on the windshield, the GPS is either too far away or I need to put it above my head. I got this arm and now I can mount it on the side window again. The suction is better than my old GPS mount that kept falling off in winter time (it is very cold here in winter). This one stick well through out the seasons. The only issue is the vibration of GPS sometimes due to the long arm."
good product i only use the sensor alarm the siren is very loud it will surely make attention if someone will try to take your bike.
"I love that I can get these so cheap and have simple, secure mounts for my device on all of my human powered vehicles."
The color is great!
excelent
"My original Garmin was stolen, probably when the shop detailed it.  I searched and even bought another one which had to be returned to another company.  This Garmin has worked very well plus it has traffic information.  Lifetime maps, etc.  The size is perfect.  The case I wanted is no longer made so that was disappointing but the Garmin is a great item."
"Worked great, until I squeezed it a bit to hard to make it adhere to the glue strips. On the next one, I will warm up the adhesive first."
awwsome...case very nice
Great protection for iPhone. Rhis style of otterbox cover my home bottom on my phone which does not allow dirt behind the screen. Recommend this box to anyone who works out in the elements.
Works perfect! Love it.
"Really well done, especially considering the price. Watch holds well. Nice stand for iphone six. Stable. Looks good. Surprisingly inexpensive."
"Very good price, works very well. I plugged my I phone 5 direct to the charger. This power adapter which can be used for input AC110-240V and output 5VDC/1A. It charged very fast. Great products. I am very happy with this adapter and will buy it again."
Works as expected with a Toshiba tablet running Windows 8.1.
Love it
failed to work with data transfer on my devices very quickly after initial use
when you use it the phone have different sound I had to replace my phone from att then I use the case again so the problem is from the case
Great cords
This is my favorite car charger for any cell phone that uses microUSB. The cable is coiled so it doesn't get all over the place yet it'll stretch as far as you need it. The light is a good indicator that the charger is plugged in correctly (how many times have we thought we had it plugged in but it wasn't?). The charge rate is acceptable and I've bought maybe five of these over the years and they've all worked as advertised.
Received quickly and they are just what I needed!
Nice.
"Love this! Only issue is if you have to take it off so if this is a case that you plan to take on and off, go with something else. But I would buy this again easily. It looks amazing, has protected my phone through countless drops and you can push all the buttons on your phone easily."
Fast shipment and product seems  to do it's job
Yes
Great for the price
As advertised.
Perfect
"It work well , have no issues"
works perfect
Awesome :)
Love it
"It may take you a few minutes, but do yourself a favor and read all the reviews for this product. I assure you it will be entertaining, but more importantly I'm sure you'll agree that at least half of them are fake! I had a good laugh, but I won't be purchasing this product."
Completely waste of money if you want a case to protect you phone. I dropped it two times and the case opened in both .Second time I wasn't lucky and the display crashed.
Great
"Loved the case and holster. The only drawback was the screen protector, did not lay flat against the phone so I removed it. Now it is perfect!"
"Pretty good screen protector, has a tendency to smudge more often and leave more fingerprints than the actual screen does, but other than that, great product, especially for the price"
Not very reliable
Ordered the case for my wife'said phone and she loves it ....very happy with this product....I will order again from your company. ....
"I attempted to plug my first device (iPhone 5) in when I went to bed.  I received a message stating that the cable was not certified.  Well, no good there.  Considering the listing stated that it WAS, in fact, certified?!  So I went over to my computer and attempted to plug the same device directly into one of it's many USB slots.  No dice!  The next day, I grabbed device #2,...an iPhone 6 PLUS.  I attempted to charge it with the cable.  Once again,..same message.  The final device, and iPhone 5S was plugged in.  Of course, I got the &#34;not certified&#34; message again.<br /><br />****I've included pictures of all three devices and messages.****<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an unbiased/honest review."
Love it to keep my IPhone 6 plus fully charged all day
My item got canceled! So i wouldn't be able to make a review! Thanks
The Velvet Skin Coat arrived on time and in good condition. The product is as promised and looks great. I don't wear makeup but it makes my skin looks smooth when I put it with my moisturizer.
It eats the battery
Convenient when traveling light.
"I like this product very much. Two lenses are supplied, a fish eye lens, and a wide angle macro lens. They seem strong and well made.<br />For each, there is a snugly fitting rubber protection for when they are not being used, and they come with a small looped cord so that they can be attached to your key chain, to keep them handy until they are needed.<br />They are attached to the phone with a magnetic ring, making them very easy to use, and quick to put on and take off. Several extra rings are included, for your convenience.<br />The quality of the lens is without question—the quality is remarkable, especially given the reasonable price, and we found that if you use the camera's zoom, the macro lens works just like the fish eye lens, an added bonus if for some reason you don't have time to change the lens while photographing.<br />In summary, this is an excellent one. One doesn't usually get top quality design, functionality and a low price all at once, but here, you do--definitely a five star product!"
Great for the price and still working
Love this bluetooth headset.  Wear them at work every day. Sound great and are comfortable. I did have one side stop working not long after getting  them but the company sent me a new pair and they have been good ever since.
"The charging port works good, but my network internet 4Gs has no signal. That's right....Zero.<br />It is probably the wrong frequency for my Note 2 i317.<br />PS: I checked all connections including the antenna connection and they are good. The new port card does not work for network internet signal. The old port card network signal strength is great but no port connectivity."
Very good
"Overall I am content with this case/holster as this was the first one made available on the market that I could find.  It protects the phone, comes with a screen protector, and has a holster to keep the phone out of my pocket.  My previous phone cover made it really hard to power the phone on/off but this one actually makes it easier than with the cover off!  I have dropped my phone a few times with this cover on and it has easily survived the falls with no damage to the phone or the case.<br /><br />My issues with the unit is the overall quality is not where I had hoped it would be.  The belt clip is not very strong and was not tight from the factory, wiggling from side to side.  The material inside the holster was not centered and was outside of the recess that was made for it, so it has started to come off.  The rubber shell on the phone drags on the holster and is causing the case to pull off the bottom of the phone.<br /><br />The issues are minor enough that I still like this overall but I know I will have to buy another one in a year or so.  Considering the cost I'm okay with that."
"It compatibale with Samsung and iPhone, but not with ZTE"
It's pretty good but i've used it for only a short period of time and it looks like the strap is already all scratched up. It's not great wear and tear.
"It's come to my attention that many people don't really understand what they are buying when they buy a power bank, also known as an external battery. So I'd like to start by briefly covering what a power bank is and what the various terms mean that are used when discussing them. If you're already an expert on this topic, please skip the next two paragraphs to read my experience with this product. If you simply want the summary, go to the last paragraph.<br /><br />A power bank is nothing more than an external battery that you can use to power and / or charge just about any device that has a cord that connects to a power source via a standard USB port. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes and configurations, but there are really only three things to look for when looking at performance. One is the number of USB ports on the device, another is the amperage (listed in milliamps or amps) available through each port and lastly, the total amount of energy stored in the battery, which may be referred to as &#34;capacity&#34; for which the units are usually referred to in milliamps per hour or mAh. If you have a newer Android smartphone or tablet that you want to charge, then you want a power bank that offers a 2 amp USB port. If you have an iPod or iPhone, you can generally get away with a single 1 amp port, but I always recommend having at least one 2 amp port. A power bank with more than one port will, in theory, allow you to charge more than one device at a time. The thing to keep in mind when shopping for a power bank is that manufacturer claims are often inflated to at least some degree. The most often exaggerated feature is the mAh capacity of a power bank and total amperage output is a close second. Capacity is important because more capacity allows you more device &#34;up-time&#34; per charge on the bank.<br /><br />Over the past several years, I've been asked by a variety of sellers to test and review their power banks, and while I always did my best to accurately review each item, it was impossible to get precise, quantitative data on the performance of the banks because the only way to do so is if you have proper testing equipment. You can give anecdotal evidence like &#34;It charged my tablet quickly,&#34; but you really can't measure the mAh capacity and the amperage put out at the USB ports with any kind of accuracy. Writing informative and accurate reviews is extremely important to me, so I've since acquired testing equipment that allows me to get precise and accurate data regarding the capabilities of a power bank or charger; and I have to admit I'm excited to finally know without a doubt that I'm giving accurate information about a product.<br /><br />All that being said, here's what I found with the OLALA C2-i 6000mah Portable Charger ...<br /><br />It has 1 USB port and one built-in retractable Lightning plug on a 2 inch wire, a power button and a four light blue power level indicator and roughly measures 6&#34; x 2 1/2&#34; x 3/8&#34;. The built-in Lightning cable has a 90 degree end that is too wide to fit my iPod Touch 5G with its Otterbox Defender case installed, so I had to trim the insulating rubber surrounding the plug with a razor blade (see picture) and it now fits and charges my iPod just fine.<br /><br />I received my sample of this product and fully charged the device, which took only a short time, as it was mostly charged on arrival.<br /><br />Using a Load Inducer, I placed a 2.4 amp load on the USB port and was able to draw that power for 5 minutes without issues. Next I used the load inducer and a power monitor that measures total power consumed (mAh), and placed 1.8 amp load on the power bank, and it provided 3,580mAh at 5 volts (4,838 mAh at 3.7 volts). I charged the unit back up and ran the test again with the power bank ultimately putting out 3627 mAh at 5 volts (4,901 mAh at 3.7 volts).<br /><br />Power banks use a 3.7 volt battery, as do most cell phones, but the USB standard is 5.0 volts, so the energy must be converted from 3.7 volts at the powerbank to 5 volts for output, and then back to 3.7 volts for use by the device being charged. Because of the voltage conversion and other factors involved, there will always be some energy lost, so no power bank will put out 100% of stated capacity to the device to be charged.<br /><br />In summation, this power bank is capable of putting out 2.4 full amps and it will easily put out a steady 1.8 amps (and maybe more) for the duration of the charge, which is more than enough to charge any device you might have. Having a power button helps keep the bank from slow draining when not in use, and the blue LED lights indicating percent of power remaining and charge status is definitely a plus. 4,900 mAh is enough to greatly extend the battery life of a tablet, and charge pretty much any phone two or three times. My testing indicates this power bank puts out 82% of advertised capacity and that puts it somewhere in the range of &#34;good&#34; to &#34;very good&#34;. Anything above 90% of stated capacity is considered excellent and of the dozens of power banks I've tested and reviewed, only one or two have broken the 90% milestone. This power bank does a good job, and I'd like to rate it 5 stars; but the 29.99 price tag (at time of review) makes it a little on the expensive side for a power bank with its capacity. Still, the built in Lightning cable is an added value that most of the competition doesn’t have and that may very well make this a worthwhile buy for iOS users. I’d rate it 4.5 stars if it were possible, but I can’t do that, so given the good performance and the uncommon feature of a built in Lightning cable, I’m going to round my rating up and not down.<br /><br />🌟 Complimentary Product Received for Testing and Unbiased Review 🌟ts, so the energy must be converted from 3.7 volts at the powerbank to 5 volts for output, and then back to 3.7 volts for use by the device being charged.

"Great, Simple, Blue."
great case
Works Great!
Easy to use and sturdy. Applying the magnet was not an issue.<br /><br />Does not fall off on bumpy roads.<br /><br />Does block air flow from your vent a slight bit.
I feel like this case met all my expectations. The bonus is that I've received so many compliments on how great it looks!  Very happy with my choice.
"Nice case it's great for the price I had a 30 dollar case from a phone store and it broke a few weeks later,I have had this case for a month an it still looks new and none of the stones came off yet"
It is a good case but it is not convenient to take the phone out and put it in.
Solves the problem of not being able to plug in anywhere
The case has proven to protect my daughters iPhone 6. It's not bulky and it's really cute.
Works great.
great fact replacement speaker thank you
Easy to put on and works like a charm.
Love it
very satisfied
"As is typical, these barely work.  I got what I paid for."
nice new item and fast shipping
"This is a great price for a great case. It's exactly what I wanted, fits my Moto X perfectly and protects it great. I don't really drop my phone, but it seems pretty sturdy for those who do."
"Despite using soap water and window glass cleaner several times, it carries a hazy streaks, blotches . Never looks &#34;crystal clean&#34;; not even for a minute. Otherwise, it's a good  light thin flexible protective case."
"The front clear plastic scratches pretty bad, but I wasn't expecting that anyway. I would order the original clear plastic from Samsung."
Definitely not scratch resistant. Anything resistant for that matter. Dropped the phone about twice and ended up having the entire side of the phone cracked.
About 2.5 weeks the stand was broken. Cheap!
"reasonable price, gentle wrap around the edges so it doesn't crack glass or interfere with touch sensitivity."
Awesome
LOVE THAT MY PHONE LOOKS LIKE THE ORIGINAL AND THE COVER IS LIGHT WEIGHT.  MAKES HOLDING THE PHONE COMFORTABLE.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN 'STYLE'
"When plugged in to my Apple iPad Air, it says &#34;not charging&#34;, &#34;non certified product&#34;.  But, it does seem to charge the iPad.  Not thrilled.  BTW, both cables do this."
Excellent
disapointing. Charges so slowly. I believed the hype that it was going to do a good job.
I've had a [[ASIN:B001G5A4JA Small Aquapac Case]]  for my phone for years but my iPhone6 is too big for it so I bought this one to replace it based on the reviews and the fact that it should handle deeper water.  Unfortunately the latches in the FRiEQ case are far less reliable than the Aquapac and the first time I used it I had to keep checking the ground every time I opened the bag because one of the latches would fall out.  If I hadn't been so careful about that the phone would have drowned for sure.<br /><br />Now I know why the Aquapac is more than twice the price but it's well worth it.
I bought this for my moms phone and she loves it
Husband uses this does not have blue tooth in his car.  Works great!
Missing part and it was advertised for iphone6 it was for iPhone 5
"I was fortunate enough to buy this while it was in its promotional launch, but now I'm buying a second for my other car. Great quality, simple and easy to use, and extremely convenient. I've used other similar phone holder devices that either slid around or the magnet wasn't strong. This one is great! Thanks!"
Nice fit.... looks and feels good
My husband loves this iPhone case!
Goog case
Great product fast delivery.
I bought this case for my girlfriend. She has had it for less than a month and it has already started to stain from having it in her pockets and in her purse. The case protects the phone just fine. I just wish for her that it was still pink in color.
excellent little battery for the s5. couldn't get any smaller and still provide the extra battery capacity that it offers. I ordered the black one and found that the matte black finish looks good and offers average grip. I would say that it has effectively doubled my battery life and love the fact you don't have to turn the unit on for it to work.
"Good cheap phone, it is what it is."
"Works great for my Eclipse 2009 and my grand daughter Toyota 4 Runner 1999.<br />Now I can hear my music, Pandora, etc."
Great sound
Just what I wanted!<br />I was able to follow easy instructions online in order to transfer parts from my old broken phone to this new part.
Love it
"This device is worth every penny. In two months we were extremely informed instead of in the dark. Super accurate, reliable and awesome. he features are fun to work with and the device never let us down. Until we lost it. Darn."
Seems ok so far after 1 month of usage. I did have other 3rd party replacement batteries that went flat very quickly after 2 weeks of usage. This is a quality product that I will not hesitate to recommend.
I bought this for a friend so I'm not using it myself and can't really review it.
